moonlanding,"The True Story will investigate the real cause of the explosion that killed Apollo 13. It was not, as the movie tells us, the result of a damaged coil in one of the oxygen tanks. It was a spectacular blunder; a mistake that no one at NASA caught. We’ll show how one of the cheapest and simplest components on the spacecraft caused its undoing

STORY,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJCDbHW94IM,0,654693,0,0,1410,sJCDbHW94IM,"ignition sequence start Apollo 13 the 1970 moon mission became a dramatic fight for survival a story more remarkable than Hollywood could ever imagine the more I learned about the mission the more I learned about what everyone went through I literally wrote on the cover of my script just show it when their spacecraft explodes Tom Hanks delivers one of the most famous lines in cinematic history houston we have a problem but did anyone actually say that how accurate is the film's depiction of animosity between the real astronauts of Apollo 30 that never occurred it happened in the movie and we objected to that and what was it really like back at Mission Control get those guys home pay attention to your data get with it experiment will test the reality of what we see on screen how did they survive the intense cold in space and how real was the threat from deadly gases they would have had a very very high levels of carbon dioxide beyond what would be sustainable and did this contraption cobbled together with duct tape and cardboard really saved their lives we weren't gonna have any second chances we explore the real stories of ingenuity and courage behind the rescue of Apollo 13 these men - four years of to seeking out mortal danger and on this mission to the moon mortal danger is what they encountered we smile Apollo 13 was released in 1995 it start um Hanks and director Ron Howard attended a series of premieres around the world the film nine Academy Award nominations but it wasn't the Academy Ron Howard really wanted to impress thank you one of the most nerve-racking screenings that I've ever had was when we showed the movie before it had been in theatrical release in Houston and many many astronauts and mission controllers came to this screening and uh man I was I my stomach was churning the film Nellie didn't happen it's all the buckets based on co-authored by leading science writer Jeffrey Kluger almost wasn't published the response was nobody is going to want to read about three man who didn't land on the moon 25 years ago but Kluger persevered spending many hours with Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell who was played by Tom Hanks in the film when we did finally have a proposal done and centered around two publishers 11 of 13 publishers still passed on the book only two made an offer but when the story reached Ron Howard's production company he immediately saw its potential I intend as a director is to sort of fall in love with an idea it's not only a survival story but it also turns out it's a rescue story this is something that we discovered as we began developing it the idea of rescue survival that's good drama what this drama of three men's quest for the moon has in abundance his nail-biting tension all of it drawn from real life a much of it captured by news cameras long before Hollywood took up the story the Apollo 13 spacecraft has had a serious power supply malfunction that could cause the lunar landing mission to be terminated early April 1917 the world held its breath as three astronauts hurtle towards the earth at over 20,000 miles an hour for six days they had struggled to survive in a fatally damaged spacecraft they had burned off the last of their fuel making one final course correction and now it all came down to this moment if they hit the Earth's atmosphere at the wrong angle they would die in space or burn up on re-entry on the ground mission controllers in Houston Texas sweated through the last agonizing moments in the journey of Apollo 13 you standing fire it was the dramatic finale of an incredible story many believe the mission had been cursed from the outset simply because 13 was an unlucky number from the beginning the mission did seem dogged by bad luck NASA had carefully selected the crew and issued a team photo mission commander Jim Lovell and crewmates Ken Mattingly and Fred Hayes but just days before the launch Mattingly was suddenly dropped because he'd been exposed to German measles we changed out a crewman two and a half days before launch and it it was breaking up the team in the movie you see Tom Hanks as Jim Lovell pointing at me and say that's just flight surgeon horse but NASA couldn't risk one of the astronauts becoming ill during the mission so they brought in a replacement and rushed out this official photo for the press the third place was taken by 38 year-old Jack Swagger their mission was to land on an unexplored part of the moon they would spend ten days in space for the scheduled launch time chosen right to the minute for the optimum conditions in space only added to the superstitious notion that Apollo 13 was tempting fate their launch took off at 1:13 p.m. Central time which is 1313 p.m. but this really was said strictly by the cold and objective laws of physics and orbital mechanics that's good okay from my standpoint I never even considered 13 an unlucky mission I don't think any of my controllers did the crew certainly didn't we have to eliminate any element of superstition we deal with facts flight controller gene Kranz was a key figure in the real Apollo 13 mission played on screen by Ed Harris the real Krantz was a tough level-headed ex fighter pilot but as the film depicts despise his disdain for superstition Krantz started every mission including Apollo 13 with a distinctive white waistcoat hand-stitched by his wife ignition sequence start and as this third mission to the moon blasted off the launch pad NASA was confident nothing had been left to chance just five and a half minutes into the mission Apollo 13 is its first snack one of the second stage rocket engines suddenly cut out and the astronauts feared they might not even make it into space when the center ends has shut down two minutes early we worried that we either did not have enough power to first of all get into Earth orbit and then have enough fuel left over to go all the way to the milk Houston control had to make an immediate decision abort now we'll keep going on the remaining engines Mission Control came in what - the system has said yep if we don't lose another engine it's okay Lovell Hayes and swaggered believe they'd survive the kind of glitch that hit many missions if they luck continued the moon was their next stop we thought we had gotten through our crisis from then on it was clear sailing but then two days into the mission and two hundred thousand miles from home disaster struck the astronauts had no way of knowing exactly what had happened but they knew it wasn't good and the movie ensured that what Mission Control heard next would go down in history houston we have a problem it became one of the most recognizable catchphrases in the English language it's the fantastic understatement of it which it not only makes its point but also sort of demonstrates the character and the nature of of these astronauts I could have panicked after the explosion and bounced off the walls for about ten minutes and had been right back where I started from in Mission Control in Houston they were momentarily stunned I had a feeling like I had been punched real hard in the stomach it just took all the air out of me for five seconds the situation we were in stark and grim as it was just sunk in on me mission controllers now had three astronauts stranded in space but they still didn't know what had actually happened just less than 56 hours into Apollo 13s mission astronaut Jack Swagger's had been asked by Houston to stir the ship's liquid oxygen tanks it was a routine procedure to keep the system pressurized do we like it there turn up your cryo tapes but when he flipped the switch that was an explosion we had a pretty large bang abilities with the warning app we were looking at a sea of debris little kernels that look like popcorn close to the window that was frozen oxygen shards and pieces of shredded thermal blanket that was all around the spacecraft it looks grim this is gonna fit to five amps and no pressure increase the astronauts knew their lives are at risk and in the movie Tom Hanks confronts another bitter realization we just lost the moon it didn't take much intelligence a lifebuoy to realize that this mission was going to be shortened Louisville and haze would have been the fifth and six men's allowed long I just had a sick feeling my stomach right there I knew we had lost the landing it was what they aspired to is what the mission was and so from my very first conversations with Jim you can see that years later decades later he still felt that pang I realized that I was not gonna walk on the moon and that's the only reason why I was up there that was something that Tom Hanks understood very well and and really wanted to convey so did I in the movie Tom Hanks as Lovell sees his dream slipping away 13 this is Houston we're reading you telemetry now instead of walking on the moon they all knew they'd be lucky just to make it home alive their spaceship the most technologically complex piece of machinery ever built might turn out to be their tomb once the launch rockets have been discarded Apollo 13 had three main components the lunar module Aquarius designed to land on the moon's surface the command module Odyssey where the crew would normally spend most of the mission and the service module containing fuel and oxygen this is where the explosion had occurred leaving a gaping hole in the spacecraft and worse a trail of oxygen leaking from the two cryogenic tanks the venting of oxygen was much more frightening because that was their very source of life without oxygen you can't survive in a space of oxygen in its super cold liquid form was the lifeblood of the Apollo mission professor Paul Roundtree has studied the science of Apollo 13 and how its portrayed in the movie they use the oxygen to drive fuel cells so they combine hydrogen and oxygen in the fuel cell and the result of that is to make electricity and water the electricity you need to do the navigation and things like this so really without the oxygen the the spaceship is not a functioning machine at all in the film there's a heated exchange when the astronauts realized that a spacecraft is crippled I went all I did was stir those tanks it was that gauge reading before he hit the switch but this is where the film makes a major departure from historical fact there was no argument there was no way anyone throwing those switches would have known could have known what was going to transpire that never occurred it happened in the movie and we objected to that both the crew and the cast they don't tell me how to fly - damn cm all right do a job they asked me a stir the damn tanks and I stir the tank I was clear with with everyone that we were gonna have to consolidate and in some places sort of pump up the emotion Ron Howard said look at I have to show anxiety I have to show suspense I have to show straight I can't do that by just showing a picture a video of a man's face with perspiration coming down I have to have an oral confrontation what I was digging for was a sense of what they might have been feeling and what I explained to them is that even though you guys may have been able to hold it in check I'm gonna want to reflect it dramatically for for people in reality the astronauts and ground crew did exactly what they were trained to do they remain calm we're reading a zero and two pressure and fuel cell 113 but the situation looked great I'll pre odor as the liquid oxygen leaked away all of their fuel cells shut down the fact that they didn't train for exactly this disaster wasn't an oversight on NASA's part if you had said to these guys on the ground if you lose all your fuel cells all your oxygen your command module is dead and you're halfway to the moon what do you do and they said you you die in space that's what you do a flight director Glynn Lunney believe they still had a chance we don't sit around wringing our hands about all the things that could happen or not happen that would make this turn out to be a failure we think about what do we have to do to make it a success in the movie we see the tensions in Mission Control start to boil over all over the simulator and get an estimate yeah I don't want another estimate I want the procedures now good drama maybe but not what the real gene Kranz would do in Mission Control you never lose your temper because that is an indicator to the teams and Mission Control at the flight director their boss is losing it his concern is now starting to bubble over this is the real gene Kranz talking to his controllers in the case of the crisis you know it's everybody keep cool we solve the problem and let's not make it any worse by yes no matter what happens no matter how frustrated you get you a slight director have the responsibility to take the actions necessary for crew safety and mission success that is your job and controlling your emotions is key to doing that job make sure we don't spoil the whole mission Regine Krantz and his team the mission was now one of survival in the aftermath of the explosion they made the decision to continue on course towards the moon then use its gravitational pull to slingshot the spaceship back towards Earth with the service and command modules would have to be shut down to save power and the crew would have to move to the lunar module the LEM as a kind of lifeboat mighty calm very calm you better think about getting in the lab or using alarm systems what they knew they had to do since power was gone in here was get over to the lunar module and stay there this would be a way that they could stay alive for the next several days until they could come home the problem was the lunar module was designed only for the moon landing and then 33 hours on the surface but now they'd be living in it for days and the chemical filters that remove carbon dioxide from the air wouldn't last that long just like a charcoal filter in in a home water filter ultimately it becomes saturated and you have to switch it the carbon dioxide was rising in another module and carbon dioxide in that magnitude is poisonous to humans you certainly lose capability to think clearly to do any reasoning and somebody could become totally unconscious with that depending on if the level got high enough and it's then that the true story Trump's anything Hollywood could have possibly invented the crew needed new filters while they could easily get them that from the command module but the command module filters were squared the lunar module filters were round the challenge was essentially to find a way to make a square peg fit in a round hole to adapt the square canister from the command module to the round slot in the lunar module we gotta find a way to make this fit into the hole for this using nothing but that let's get it on okay let's build a filter but in reality it was just one man who found the solution crew systems chief had smiling forty years later he still remembers exactly how he saved the mission we work from the stowage list which is just to list everything that's on board and so we discovered duct tape we said aha the astronauts lives would depend on a plastic bag the cobbled cover from the flight plan and a hose from one of the spacesuits we put the plastic bag over the canister we'll take tape and tape it to the canister to seal it next one end of the hose was fed into the plastic bag and when the other end was connected to the circulation fan in the ship it sucked through the filter fan is drawing the oxygen through it would solve the co2 problem people constantly want to talk to me about about that moment people have told me that the you know in management courses that they play that clip and and talk about that kind of by the seat of your pants problem-solving and it was just that was a gift when we discovered that that that scene in the film before the makeshift filter kicks in Jack Swagger's played by Kevin Bacon is shown reeling from the effects of co2 but did the co2 levels inside the capsule ever get that high Andrew Bowden a student has agreed to subject himself under close supervision to early-stage carbon dioxide poisoning after just two minutes the effects are dramatic as shown by a simple memory test la B Street helmet anything more No compared with his normal rate of recall his memory has declined by 40 percent but even more telling his processing speed has slowed by more than 25 percent I could taste the co2 in it head and then it felt like I really need to breathe a lot heavier than I had been what's happening is that the carbon dioxide is interfering with the ability that hemoglobin in our blood cells to absorb oxygen and if that continues the brain is eventually starved of oxygen a condition known as hypoxia that produces severe disorientation I think I was alone it was just how did it focus on what was being said to me and so that starts to impede your ability to remain oxygenated and then that cuts down on your ability to think clearly and to focus on your house so the co2 levels in the capsule couldn't have gone as high as the film suggests if they had the astronauts would have been too incapacitated to build the makeshift filter that saved their lives the cartridges that they had available for the lunar module would last about 35 hours and if they had no other way of removing that carbon dioxide it would have continued to realize at the end of the journey by the time they got back to re-entry into the earth it would have been about 50% carbon dioxide in the air that they were breathing and that is certainly very dangerous and probably lethal for the astronauts for the astronauts of Apollo 13 the most painful moment of the failed mission came as they looped around the far side of the moon from high above the lunar surface they could see the spot where they were supposed to land they had time to ponder what might it be as we went around the back side of moon I was just a nod with the view we shot a lot of pictures because we knew we may not get to look at this scene again it was so painful and so poignant to see that happen to know that this opportunity has been lost is in some ways worse than never getting picked for a flight you are almost there the moon is filling your windows and then it's been snatched away from you as Apollo 13 began the long haul back to earth medics on the ground began to worry about the cumulative effects of stress and fatigue the astronauts would need to be fully alert to carry out the complex maneuvers needed to get them home they had to operate not just at a level of ordinary excellence but extraordinary excellence because everything else around them had broken down we've got only sporadic sleep periods cat naps and not any deep sleep so there was a fatigue factor to make matters worse since the electronics have been shut down to save power there was no source of heat in the spaceship we had to do what we had to do and if it got cold well so be it and even if they were getting frostbite we would have had to continue they knew as well better than we what the circumstances were another student has agreed to enter a hypothermic chamber to experience exactly what it was like for the astronauts in the spacecraft records show the temperature dipped to just above zero Celsius seen through a thermal imaging camera the subjects extremities rapidly begin to show in blue as his body diverts blood flow to the essential organs are you ready to go in three two after just a few minutes he's asked to perform a simple dexterity test stop okay so score in this case is eight nine ten eleven all right the cold has severely affected his performance reducing his dexterity by more than a third you really start tensing up your muscles start contracting a lot more you can't control this becomes a bit frustrating cute that folder temperature you're not able to to perform for the same level these tasks were simple compared to the precise operations required of the astronauts but were they ever in mortal danger from the cold if the core temperature of the body is not significantly reduced then the biochemical and physiological responses are less important than the distraction is the the constant inundation of always feeling a painful sensation and that I believe is more important than the physiological with intense cold bad air and virtually no sleep an ordinary individual might have succumbed to the ordeal in space but the super fit astronauts were able to function and even feed off their stress what stress does severe stress is in it you get some surges of adrenaline for one thing and I think that served them very very well in in that particular essence but one incident also depicted in the movie shows just how concerned the astronauts were about their own mental state Jack Swaggart scribbles a note to himself to make sure he doesn't inadvertently hit the wrong switch that is accurate he was alone in the command module Jim Lovell and Fred Hayes were in the lunar module and one of those switches was jettison the lunar module and in the the movie when he explains what he's done Tom Hanks says Jim Lovell says that's good thinking on April the 17th after four days of fighting to stay alive the astronauts were now just hours away from their biggest challenge re-entering Earth's atmosphere as the movie shows Lovell had to make a course correction with a fuel burn of precisely 20 2.4 seconds if they miscalculated the angle of reentry they'd either burn up or bounce off which they felt was worse if we were not successful in getting back then we could be perhaps at an elliptical orbit and we would be doing that for a considerable length of time perhaps as far as we're concerned forever as far as the astronauts knew they missed their mark Apollo 13 would become their floating tomb orbiting forever as a memorial to NASA's failure to make it back through Earth's atmosphere they first had to turn electrical power back on using much of what was left of their precious battery reserve the biggest concern I had was how would the mothership be how do you power up this mothership that was never intended to be powered down the systems that normally would have heaters keeping them warm and keeping them functioning at their optimum level had now been cold soaked so you had no idea in fact the odds were greater that something was gonna go wrong then that they would things would go well we weren't gonna have any second chances the astronauts had a stroke of luck the command module powered up without a hitch but was it fit to take the punishment of reentry as they prepared for re-entry the crew of Apollo 13 jettison the service module as it careered away they hurriedly snap this picture of the damage it didn't reveal what caused the explosion but it did raise fears there was further damage that might still kill them silence big difference is that right for the whole panel is gone out almost from the pace to the engine that really worried us because that could also damaged our heo wishes our only hope of getting back through the atmosphere safely three hours later it was time to jettison the lunar module the lifeboat which had carried them so close to home an emotional moment in the movie it was a line in real life it had done so much work that it was never designed to do that nobody ever imagined it would do it was easy to fall in love with it it had given these men back their lives with reentry now just moments away one big question remained was the heat shield that protected the capsule from burning up in Earth's atmosphere still intact the world was watching and praying in the montage we show at the end of the movie of people all over the planet stopping and watching this was real as the Odyssey capsule entered Earth's atmosphere the intense heat caused so much electrical interference there was a communications blackout with Houston that was typical but no returning capsule had ever been out of radio contact for longer than three minutes there was no invention and no hyperbole there at the end of three minutes we will know if they're alive or if they're dead the ground controller who would make first contact with the crew if they were still alive was Joe Cohen everybody was standing or sitting around it three minutes go by still didn't hear anything and that's when Krantz said Tom we're standing by Odyssey Houston standing by oh no answer what a half minute go by Odyssey Houston standing by no answered the other half minute Odyssey Houston standing by everyone at that time for the first time in this entire mission had just a split second to doubt that maybe something went wrong the seconds continued to crawl by that was the longest minute and a half minute and 27 seconds to be precise not that anyone in Mission Control has ever spent in fact there's a picture that someone snapped of all the flight directors standing staring looking at those clocks and that is probably the most graphic picture that came out Apollo 13 and just about then you could hear a little change in the nature of the static as if some radio list was on there and a few seconds after them yeah everybody relaxed cuz we knew they were okay no one at that moment knew what had caused the extra period of dead air but it didn't take NASA long to work it out I'm reentering at atmosphere it's normal to lose radio contact for a short period of time returning spacecraft aims are hit the atmosphere at an angle of 6.5 degrees making the radio blackout three minutes long but Apollo 13 hits at a shallower angle and so the blackout persisted much longer than anyone anticipated I've even inside Earth's atmosphere the astronauts were still in mortal danger one of the last things I had a worried about was the three parachutes the explosive charges for deploying the parachutes had been ice-cold for four days we couldn't afford electrical power to keep him warm and if the compare Texas didn't fire to put out the parachutes of course we had have been right on course hitting the ocean just where we should have been however at a speed that would be much too high to be survivable but the parachutes burst out right on cue and this was the moment when the world realized the astronauts were home safely it looks good for some the real story of Apollo 13 was almost too good to be true I do a lot of preview screenings and in this case it was always very positive our test scores were fantastic but I suddenly I come across one card and they rate it poor and they definitely wouldn't recommend it and so I won all the way down and it said this please would please comment on the ending and a big old block letters he spelled out awful more Hollywood bolt they would never survive I thought well I okay he didn't know his true story great the movie ends with the astronauts triumphant return but it barely touches on the cause of the accident Tom Hanks briefly mentions a faulty coil as the cause of the explosion but the true story is more complex when NASA experts started to comb through a mass of data trying to reconstruct what went wrong an extraordinary picture began to emerge the accident had been caused by an incident two weeks before the launch while Apollo 13 was still sitting on the pad at Cape Canaveral following a dress rehearsal technicians had to empty oxygen tank number two for safety reasons when they switched on the heating rod in the tank to burn off the liquid oxygen the thermostat controlling the heater fused shut they didn't realize the tank continued to heat up long after the liquid oxygen had gone we know now from laboratory tests that the temperature got up to about 900 to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit in that tank that intense heat burned off the insulation covering the wires inside the tank and so it was critically damaged before the mission even began and when we put actually corrosion in the tank on the day of the launch it was a bomb waiting to go off when Jack Swagger's stirred the liquid oxygen by switching on a small electrical fan inside the tank that bomb exploded we'd like it to stir up your cryo things but smart jumps between the fan and the heater assembly and blows the Dome of the tank off when the dome came off the insulation surrounding the tank caught fire and fed by the oxygen it was like a blowtorch racing through the Bay of the spacecraft when I found out about it post-flight I was very sad that it was really one little component that was the cause of our demise and the the loss of the granny mission Apollo 13 the movie has been lauded as a largely accurate take on history and for the most part it is but there's one element where Hollywood gave history some help it's Jack Swagger's who first says then 15 seconds later Jim Lovell joins it oh that's what it is yes yes Houston we've had a problem just not quite as sharp and dramatically interesting it's not quite as clean as the Houston we have a problem so what does the man who never said it think of that celebrated line I wish I had you know what was the word I want to use that's it registered I guess isn't like that houston we have a problem is is something that's in the public domain now that I'm kind of glad about that it's a little bit like when myth becomes fact print the myth I sort of what's happened with that line of dialogue and they are borrowed from life it happened the other way too in the film gene Kranz coined the phrase failure is not an option he never said those words but he liked the sound of them so much that's what he called his autobiography the first time you see yourself you sort of slink down in your chair and you look to see what the other people are thinking about it but then it was interesting Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did such a compelling story that after that first 30 seconds that you see yourself in the screen you're wrapped up in the movie and you're getting after that team get those guys home pay attention to your data get with it I mean you just really want to get these guys going I had the opportunity to to have lunch with Billy Wilder who and you know I and he cited Apollo 13 and he said he said I think it's your best work and he said and here's what I loved about it it was it was a movie about a guy who didn't get his dream and that's what made it so remarkable if there's a legacy for the movie Apollo 13 it's a reminder that this is a joint enterprise it's not just three guys in a can it's thousands more at the Kennedy Space Center 300 million Americans and 6 billion worldwide to send these three emissaries of the species out to do something remarkable an Apollo 13 was a reminder of all of that I'd like to think it will always serve that role the Wild West was often more exciting than fiction and its outlaws and lawman were often interchangeable the facts about the real rooster Coburn the difficulties of hanging and the weapon of choice for a gunslinger coming up next"
moonlanding,"Space is the worst. It’s got hostile radiation, a total lack of atmosphere, near absolute zero temperatures, problematic gravity wells, and worse. 

In order to keep your spacecraft alive in that environment, you need electricity to keep it warm. Not to mention all the power to run scientific instruments and the transmitters to send that data home.

Getting enough power in space is a big problem.

 of atmosphere, near absolute zero temperatures, problematic gravity wells, and worse. In order to keep your spacecraft alive in
 that environment, you need electricity to keep it warm. Not to mention all the power to run scientific
 instruments and the transmitters to send that data home. Getting enough power in space is a big problem. There are three ways of generating power in
 space: solar panels, radioisotope thermoelectric generators, and nuclear fission reactors. Each have their pros and cons. Let’s start with solar panels. This technology has been around for decades,
 and works by using photons from the Sun to knock electrons free from atoms. These electrons are harvested and provide
 electricity for a spacecraft to operate. Solar panels need to be big to supply usable
 energy to a spacecraft. The International Space Station’s eight
 solar arrays contain thousands of solar cells and take up an area half the size of a football
 field. Its arrays can produce up to 120,000 watts
 of energy, enough to power 40 homes. Solar panels designed to fly to space are
 much more expensive than ground-based panels. Because weight and volume on the spacecraft
 are at a premium, they use high-efficiency cells. Space agencies have pioneered many of the
 technologies used in solar panels. The European Space Agency recently announced
 that they enabled a very thin solar cell, just 0.1 millimeters thick, that provides
 30 percent efficiency by sandwiching together 4 different layers of materials and can absorb
 wider wavelengths of sunlight. The most efficient panels on the commercial
 market only convert 22.5 percent and most are in the 15-17 percent range. NASA’s Opportunity Rover, set down on the
 surface of Mars back in January, 2004. It’s now spent more than 5,000 days exploring
 the Red Planet, searching for evidence of past water. At night, Opportunity experiences temperatures
 that go as low as minus 105 Celsius. No matter what happens, Opportunity always
 needs to keep its batteries above -20 Celsius when they’re supplying power to the rover,
 and 0 Celsius when they’re recharging. In order to keep its electronics warm, Opportunity
 has 8 tiny pellets of decaying plutonium as well as electrical heaters. If Opportunity can’t get at least enough
 electricity to keep its batteries warm, it can’t recharge, and it’ll die. In the best conditions, its solar panels generate
 about 140 watts during the Martian day. It needs about 100 watts if it needs to drive
 anywhere. Dust falling on the solar panels was expected
 to reduce its power to below what it needed to to keep operating within a couple of years,
 but surprisingly, dust devils have cleaned off the panels and allowed it to keep going. Eventually its batteries will run down, it
 won’t be able to keep itself warm enough on a bitterly cold Martian night, and the
 rover will be lost for good. Solar panels like this are equipped on many
 spacecraft throughout the inner Solar System, where enough radiation from the Sun can be
 captured and used to power instruments, heaters, and even ion engines. While the solar energy at Earth is about 1300
 watts per square meter, the intensity drops to 1/25th, or 50 watts per square meter by
 the time you get to Jupiter. This is all thanks to the inverse square law,
 where the intensity at any distance is equal to the inverse square of that distance. This is why NASA’s Juno spacecraft, is such
 a feat of power engineering. The spacecraft is equipped with three solar
 panel arrays 9-meters long, covered with 18,698 separate solar cells. If Juno was at Earth, it would be able to
 generate 14000 watts of electricity, but out at Jupiter, it can only generate 500 watts. This has given Juno the electricity it needs
 to run all its science experiments, no to mention capturing these amazing images of
 Jupiter when it orbits the planet every 2 weeks. But Juno is the first spacecraft to ever get
 this far from the Sun using solar panels. The previous 8 spacecraft that ever got this
 far out have used radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Let’s go out the edge of the Solar System,
 to NASA’s twin Voyager spacecraft. In order to just communicate with these probes
 from Earth, signals need to travel for almost 20 hours moving at the speed of light. The Voyagers have the same problem as Opportunity,
 they need to keep themselves warm, but they’re much farther from the Sun, and they need to
 have enough power to run their science instruments and transmit their discoveries back to Earth. Each Voyager is equipped with three radioisotope
 thermoelectric generators (or RTGs), which are really just a chunk of Plutonium-238 which
 is slowly decaying. This decay releases alpha particles, which
 bombard the surface of their container, heating it up. And this heat energy is converted into electricity. At the beginning of the mission, the three
 RTGs supplied each Voyager with 470 watts of electrical power. The RTGs on board the Voyagers have been running
 for over 40 years now, but the amount of usable heat is steadily decreasing. It’s expected that they’ll get so low
 within the next decade that the spacecraft won’t be able to power up their transmitters
 any longer. RTGs provide ample power deep out in space,
 but they come with their own set of problems. The first is the fact that they require a
 dangerous element like plutonium, strontium or polonium. They’re highly radioactive, and dangerous
 if they get released into the environment. In fact, this was one of the reasons Cassini
 was crashed into Saturn, to minimize the chances that its RTGs could harm life on one of its
 icy moons (not to mention infecting it with its Earth bacteria). The other problem is that that RTGs release
 radioactive particles that can interfere with the spacecraft’s electronics, adding unnecessary
 noise to its data gathering. For this reason, the RTGs are usually mounted
 on a boom far away from the spacecraft and its instruments. The Voyagers used a type of generator called
 the multihundred-watt radioisotope thermoelectric generator. Newer spacecraft like Galileo, Cassini and
 New Horizons used a modified design called the General Purpose Heat Source, which could
 generate about 300 watts of power, using 7.8 kg of Plutonium-238. Space missions built after 2010, like NASA’s
 Curiosity, use multi-mission RTGs. Their heat source is plutonium-238 dioxide,
 generating 125 watts at the beginning of the mission and falling to 100 watts after 14
 years. After the end of the Cold War, the US stopped
 producing plutonium-238, and ironically had to start buying the material from Russia. And then Russia stopped making it too. With a dwindling supply, the US Department
 of Energy actually banned NASA from including thermal RTGs in many missions. This limited the amount of power they could
 produce, and pretty much ended science for the outer Solar System. Earlier this year, though, NASA announced
 that the ban was over, and upcoming mission proposals for 2018 and beyond could include
 up to two multi-mission RTGs on a spacecraft. Solar panels and decaying radioactive materials. Is there anything else out there to supply
 power to a spacecraft? There’s one more, nuclear fission reactors,
 and we’ll get to them in a second, but first I’d like to thank: Minh Le
 Curious Borg Vladislav Kravtsov
 Sushant Arora William Inabnett
 Frank Walker Elad Avron And the rest of our 812 patrons for their
 generous support. If you love what we’re doing and want to
 get in on the action, head over to patreon.com/universetoday. We’ve talked about solar panels and nuclear
 batteries, but did you know there are more than 30 spacecraft were launched with nuclear
 fission reactors? One from the US, and the rest from the Soviet
 Union. Space-based nuclear fission reactors are similar
 to the kinds of reactors used down here on the surface to supply electricity. They use uranium-235 as a fuel for a fission
 reaction, where the nucleus is split, releasing energy. A kilogram of uranium can provide as much
 energy as 3 million kilograms of burning coal. The United States launched their SNAP-10A
 spacecraft in 1965, and it operated for 43 days before it stopped functioning. It’s now in a slowly deteriorating orbit
 that’ll take another 3,000 years or so before it crashes back to Earth. Don’t worry, its nuclear material should
 be largely decayed by then. During the space race, the Soviets equipped
 31 of their RORSAT reconnaissance satellites with BES-5 fission reactors. These could generate 3,000 watts of usable
 electricity. They also equipped two TOPAZ satellites that
 could produce 5,000 watts of electricity. The Soviets had a few mishaps, though. In 1977, they launched their Kosmos 954 spy
 satellite which had a BES-5 fission reactor with 50 kg of uranium-235 on board. The spacecraft suffered a series of malfunctions
 and they lost control of it. Soviet officials assured the world that the
 spacecraft would burn up in the atmosphere or hold together when it crashed into the
 ground. Because it had been launched into an extreme
 65-degree orbital inclination, it had the potential to crash into almost any population
 center across the world. When it came down, in 1977, the reactor came
 apart almost immediately as it struck the atmosphere, coating itself in radioactive
 material. Then it broke up into large chunks which fell
 to Earth over a 600-kilometer track in Canada’s Northwest Territories. Canada was only able to find, clean up and
 dispose of about 1% of the radioactive spacecraft chunks, the rest is still out there. Fortunately none of the other fission reactors
 are expected to return to Earth anytime soon. Like SNAP-10A, they’ll take hundreds or
 thousands of years to re-enter the atmosphere. Considering the dangers, no space agencies
 have launched spacecraft with fission reactors in over 30 years, but it looks like the technology
 might return again soon. NASA recently announced that they’re working
 on a new space-based fission reactor technology called Kilopower. They held a press conference in May, 2018
 announcing that they’d completed their ground tests of a new kind of fission reactor that
 could supply 1000 watts of electrical energy, and up to 10000 watts for installations on
 the Moon, Mars or even for use in spacecraft. The reactor consists of an enriched uranium
 core that’s undergoing fission decay. Heat pipes extend out from the reactor and
 connect to Sterling engines which convert the heat into electrical energy. The whole system is self-regulating. If the reactor overheats, the engines can
 draw off more power to cool it back down. If it’s too cool, the core contracts, increasing
 the rate of fission again. With the ground tests complete this year,
 NASA’s next step is to test them in space. If all goes well, future Moon or Mars explorers
 will have all the power they’ll need to survive on other worlds, run their science
 instruments, and transmit the results back home. NASA also thinks they could install these
 kilopower reactors onto spacecraft that use ion engines, provide the electricity they
 would need for extended missions. Solar panels, RTGs and fission reactors are
 the three methods that space agencies have used to power their spacecraft. And who knows, as new technologies are perfect
 down here on Earth like fusion reactors, maybe someday we’ll see those implemented in space
 too. Until then, getting anything done, especially
 anywhere far from the Sun is going to be incredibly difficult and slow. Like I said, space is the worst. Have you got any ideas for space-based power
 systems? Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Once a week I gather up all my space news

 supported by The Great Courses Plus. One of the strangest
 experimental results ever observed has got to be
 that of the single particle double-slit experiment. It's one of the most
 stunning illustrations of how the quantum
 world is very, very different from the
 large-scale world of our physical intuition. In fact, it hints that the
 fundamental nature of reality may not be physical at
 all, at least in any sense that we're familiar with. Let's start with the familiar. In fact, let's start
 with a rubber duckie. It bobs up and down in a
 pool, causing periodic ripples to spread out. Some distance away, those
 waves encounter a barrier with two gaps cut in it. Most of the wave is blocked but
 ripples pass through the gaps. When the new ripples start
 to overlap each other, they produce this
 really cool pattern. It's called an
 ""interference pattern."" It's due to the fact
 that in some places, the peak of the ripple from one
 gap stacks on top of the peak from the other gap, making
 a more extreme peak. You also get more extreme
 dips when two troughs overlap. We call this ""constructive
 interference."" But when the peak from one
 wave encounters the trough from another, they cancel
 out, leaving nothing, ""destructive interference."" So we have these alternating
 tracks of wavy and flat water. Any type of wave should make an
 interference pattern like this, for example, water
 waves and sound waves but also light waves. This double-slit
 interference of light was first observed by
 Thomas Young back in 1801. A source of light passing
 through two very thin slits produces bands of light and
 dark stripes, alternating regions of constructive and
 destructive interference, on a screen. Of course, we now
 know that light is a wave in the
 electromagnetic field thanks to the work of James
 Clerk Maxwell a century later. So it makes perfect sense
 that it should produce an interference pattern, right? But wait, we also
 know that light comes in indivisible
 little bundles of electromagnetic
 energy called ""photons."" Einstein demonstrated this
 through the photoelectric effect but his clue came
 from the quantized energy levels of Max Planck's
 black-body radiation law. Check out our episode
 on this for the details. OK. So each photon is
 a little bundle of waves, waves of
 electromagnetic field, and each bundle can't be
 broken into smaller parts. That means that
 each photon should have to decide whether
 it's going to go through one slit or the other. It can't split in half and then
 recombine on the other side. That shouldn't be a
 problem as long as you have at least two photons. One photon passes
 through each slit and then the two
 photons interact with each other
 on the other side and produce our
 interference pattern. But here, we get to one of the
 craziest experimental results in all of physics. The interference pattern
 is seen even if you fire those photons one at a time. Well, let me back up a bit. The first photon is
 detected as having arrived at a very particular
 location on the screen. The second, third, and
 fourth photons, also-- they deliver their energy
 at a single spot and so they appear to
 be acting like particles of well-determined position. But check it out. If you keep firing
 those single photons, you start to see our
 interference pattern emerge once again. By the way, Veritasium actually
 conducts this experiment in his excellent series on
 the double-slit experiment-- really worth a look. This is so bizarre. This pattern has
 nothing to do with how each photon's energy
 gets spread out, as was the case
 with the water wave. Each photon dumps all of its
 energy at a single point. No, the pattern emerges
 in the distribution of final positions of many
 completely unrelated photons. How can that be? Each photon has no idea
 where previous photons landed or where future
 photons will land yet each photon reaches the
 screen knowing which regions are the most likely
 landing spots and which are the least likely. It knows the
 interference pattern of a pure wave that passed
 through both slits equally and it chooses its landing
 point based on that. It turns out that
 the photon isn't the only thing that does this. Shoot a single electron
 through a pair of slits and it'll also appear to land
 at a single spot on the screen but fire many electrons
 and they slowly build up the same sort
 of interference pattern. This crazy effect has even been
 observed with whole atoms, even whole molecules. Buckminsterfullerene,
 buckyballs, are gigantic spherical
 molecules of 60 carbon atoms and have been
 observed to produce double-slit interference
 under special conditions. We have to conclude that each
 individual photon, electron, or buckyball travels
 through both slits as some sort of wave. That wave then
 interacts with itself to produce an
 interference pattern, except that here, the
 peaks of that pattern are regions where there's more
 chance that the particle will find itself. It looks like a wave of
 possible undefined positions that at some point,
 for some reason, resolves itself into a
 single certain position. We also saw this
 waviness in position when we talked about
 quantum tunneling. In fact, several quantum
 properties, like momentum, energy, and spin, all
 display similar waviness in different situations. We call the
 mathematical description of this wave-like distribution
 of properties a ""wave function."" Describing the behavior
 of the wave function is the heart of
 quantum mechanics. But what does the wave
 function represent? What are these waves
 of or waves in? Let's start with what we do know
 about the double-slit result. We know where the
 particle is at both ends. It starts its journey wherever
 we put the laser or electron gun or buckyball trebuchet
 and it releases its energy at a well-defined
 spot on the screen. So the particle seems to be
 more particle-like at either end but wave-like in between. That wave holds the
 information about all the possible final
 positions of the particle but also about its
 possible positions at every stage in the journey. In fact, the wave must
 map out all possible paths that the particle could take. We have this family of
 could-be trajectories from start to finish and
 for some reason, when the wave reaches the screen,
 it chooses a final location and that implies choosing
 from these possible paths. So what causes this
 transition between a wave of many possibilities
 and a well-defined thing at a particular spot? Within that mysterious
 span between the creation and the detection, is
 the particle anything more than a space
 of possibility? OK. We're adding more questions
 than we're answering. We still couldn't figure out
 what the wave is made of. In fact, the
 answers aren't known but the various interpretations
 of quantum mechanics do try. Let's talk about
 the view favored by Werner Heisenberg
 and Niels Bohr, who pioneered quantum mechanics
 at the University of Copenhagen in the 1920s. The Copenhagen interpretation
 says that the wave function doesn't have a physical nature. Instead, it's comprised
 of pure possibility. It suggests that a
 particle traversing the double-slit
 experiment exists only as a wave of possible locations
 that ultimately encompasses all possible paths. It's only when the
 particle is detected that a location and the path it
 took to get there are decided. The Copenhagen interpretation
 calls this transition from a possibility
 space to a defined set of properties ""the collapse
 of the wave function."" It tells us that
 prior to the collapse, it's meaningless to try to
 define a particle's properties. It's almost like the universe
 is allowing all possibilities to exist simultaneously
 but holds off choosing which actually
 happened until the last instant. Weirder, those different
 possible paths, those different
 possible realities, interact with each other. That interaction
 increases the chance that some paths become real and
 decreases the chance of others. There's an interaction
 between possible realities that is seen in the
 distribution of final positions in the interference pattern. That pattern is real, even
 though the vast majority of paths involved in producing
 the interference never attain reality. In the Copenhagen
 interpretation, that final choice of the
 experiment of the universe is fundamentally random
 within the constraints of the final wave function. The theory of quantum
 mechanics produces stunningly accurate
 predictions of reality and it's completely
 consistent with the Copenhagen interpretation but this is
 not the only interpretation that works. There are interpretations
 that give the wave function a physical reality. Remember, we know
 that light is a wave in the electromagnetic field and
 quantum field theory tells us that all fundamental particles
 are waves in their own fields. This may give us a
 more physical medium that drives these
 waves of possibility. And if you thought the
 Copenhagen interpretation was freaky, wait until we
 get to the many worlds interpretation, which we will
 right here on ""Space Time."" Thanks to The Great Courses Plus

 of the comments from our episode on
 the role of Jupiter in the formation of
 our solar system. Jason Blank asks, ""Wasn't
 Jupiter almost a star?"" Well, the lowest mass stars
 are around 7.5% the mass of the Sun, while Jupiter
 is 1/10,000 of a solar mass. So it's not really
 all that close. You'd need around 75 Jupiters
 piled on top of each other to ignite sustained
 fusion in its core. A few of you wonder why
 we think Jupiter even needs to have a rocky core. Well, the Sun and other
 stars don't need rocky cores because they are massive
 enough for all of that gas to collapse by itself. There's a minimum mass
 that's capable of doing that. It's called ""the Jeans mass."" It depends on cloud size,
 temperature, rotation rate, and composition. For typical interstellar clouds,
 the Jeans mass is quite a bit smaller than the Sun's
 mass but still much, much larger than Jupiter's. For Jupiter to form
 its giant ball of gas, it needed a rocky core
 to start the process. That core may have dissolved
 since Jupiter first formed. Juno will figure
 that out by carefully mapping Jupiter's gravitational
 and magnetic fields. Bike Jake would
 like me to talk more about resonant frequencies. My pleasure-- a
 resonant frequency is when two orbiting bodies
 have orbital periods that form a neat ratio of small integers. For example, for every one
 orbit of Jupiter's moon Io, its moon Europa orbits twice
 and Ganymede four times. For every eight Earth
 orbits, Venus does 13. These integer ratios
 maximize the amount of time that the planets spend
 in closest proximity. When these bodies
 are closest together, they have the strongest
 gravitational pull on each other and
 that pull stops them from straying out of
 that resonant frequency. An Imposter complains that
 the Jupiter episode was way too understandable. Don't worry. We've got some
 incomprehensible content coming your way real soon."

moonlanding,"Does life exist anywhere else in the universe? And how did it get started? Scientists are seeking the answers in the cosmos, our solar system and right here on planet Earth.

Is there life elsewhere in the universe? Anyone who has pondered the immensity of the cosmos has probably wondered at some time or another whether life exists beyond our planet? 

The search for life beyond Earth has been buoyed by recent discoveries made by NASA's Kepler telescope - it's looking for planets outside our solar system known as exoplanets. Kepler measures the brightness of distant stars and tracks a stars dimming when a planet passes in front. Up until 1995, exoplanets were purely theoretical - but scientists have since identified thousands of them.

in July, NASA scientists announced the discovery of one of their most exciting exoplanets yet - Kepler-452B. Located some fourteen thousand light-years away the planet is in the habitable zone which means it's the right distance from its own Sun and also the right size to potentially be earth-like. 

There is a limit to how much we can learn about Kepler-452B because of its distance. NASA is launching the James Webb telescope in 2018 to find earth-like planets closer to home so they can study their atmospheres for bio signatures that would indicate the presence of life. But there's another way to learn more about distant planets beyond what the Kepler telescope can tell us, and that is to look for signs of intelligent life. 

Frank Drake has been listening out for signals of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe for over 50 years. Mr Drake came up with something called the Drake Equation which is a mathematical formula that estimates how many advanced civilizations capable of transmitting signals might exist in the universe. He co-founded the SETI Institute, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Scientists at the SETI Institute have been searching for intelligent life for the past few decades.

SETI researchers have not come across any signals yet but they say this is to be expected. SETI's efforts recently got a huge boost with a launch of breakthrough Listen, overseen by Martin Rees, Stephen Hawking, and Frank Drake and funded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Yuri Milner. The project will greatly expand the organization's capacity to search and sift through data. But scientists aren't only interested in discovering life forms light-years away. At first glance our solar system seems like a rather unlikely place to find life beyond Earth but the reason scientists think it is plausible is because of the discovery of a group of organisms called extremophiles that live on earth.

Scientists are looking at the moons of Jupiter and Saturn as well as our nearest neighbor Mars. The hope is that if we find further life in our solar system on places like Mars, we will improve our understanding of how easily it might have started elsewhere. But there is another way to answer this question - determining how it started on earth.
 
One man who is trying to come up with an answer to this question is Jack Szostak. In his lab at Harvard University he's trying to determine how easy it is to create life by making it himself.   Modern cells are intricate nano scale factories stuffed with thousands of different chemicals each taking part in a complicated and messy web of reactions. Long strands of DNA and codicils genetic information. Shorter strands of RNA carry that information around the cell telling it how to manufacture the proteins that run the chemical reactions it requires to live. It seems unlikely that these systems all evolved at the same time. At the Szostak lab they're focused on two experiments. One to work out how primitive cell membranes could grow and divide into daughter cells, and the other on RNA replication. 

Dr Szostak and his team have already created a protocell from a blob of lipids which contains RNA. The sticking point at the moment is working out how to make RNA that can copy itself without relying on a helping hand from RNA enzymes. If it is a difficult process reliant upon various bits of luck or circumstance then it is possible that we are a cosmic fluke - one that isn't going to be repeated elsewhere. But if experiments like Dr Szostak show that life emerges easily, then the odds of life appearing elsewhere in the universe look more likely. 

Perhaps one day when we're looking into the night sky we'll finally know the answer to the question are we alone?

Drake came up with something called the Drake Equation which is a mathematical formula that estimates how many advanced civilizations capable of transmitting signals might exist in the universe he co-founded the SETI Institute the search for extraterrestrial intelligence scientists at the SETI Institute have been searching for intelligent life for the past few decades how does SETI search well we look at our own technology and determine which one of our technologies is detectable across the distances which separate the stars what we can detect is our radio signals our television broadcasts of which of course there are thousands our radar transmissions which are even easier to detect and so we search for those and so just recently to the radio search we have added a light search SETI researchers have not come across any signals yet but they say this is to be expected so in our galaxy a couple hundred billion stars we've looked carefully it may be a couple of thousand stars right that means we've looked at one millionth of the star systems in our galaxy carefully 1 million so you know that's like I'm into the ocean taking a glass of water and saying now you see any sharks in there Bob well I don't well I guess there are no sharks in the ocean well it'd be a little premature right all that means is your sample size isn't big enough and that would be very discouraging if it weren't to the fact that the technology keeps getting faster so there's hope SETI's efforts recently got a huge boost with a launch of breakthrough listen overseen by Martin Rees Stephen Hawking and Frank Drake and funded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Yuri Milner the project will greatly expand the organization's capacity to search and sift through data but scientists aren't only interested in discovering life forms light-years away of course the only places we can directly look for life apart from earth are on the planets and moons of our solar system and there has been talk about couldn't be some kind of life on Mars could there be something on comets could there be something under the frozen ice on Europa one of Jupiter's moons or Enceladus one of Saturn's moons and it's possible that people find life no one expects any very complex life in those places but even evidence a simple life would be more at first glance our solar system seems like a rather unlikely place to find life beyond Earth but the reason scientists think it is plausible is because of the discovery of a group of organisms called extremophiles they live on earth so extremophiles are a group of organisms that we've discovered that live in what we consider extreme environments and so we have found organisms that live at temperatures that exceed boiling water at pH is the same lower lower than battery acid scientists are looking at the moons of Jupiter and Saturn as well as our nearest neighbor Mars and so what we're looking for is something that might with microscope might look like life life needs water so we've been very interested in water worlds so what the Curiosity rover doing is doing now is going around Gale Crater and investigating ancient riverbeds and features that indicate and chemistry that indicate that there was water present you look at Jupiter it's a big gas ball you figure it probably no life there and that's probably true but Jupiter has I don't think like close to 70 moons that we know about and several of them are very large you know the size of our own moon maybe even a little bit bigger at least three of them are thought to have underneath their surfaces and the surface might just be ice or rock but underneath maybe 10 miles down maybe a hundred miles down they might have liquid oceans hidden dark inky dark oceans down there with with liquid water that's been sitting there for four billion years so after that length of time there might be something that's cooked up in there the hope is that if we find further life in our solar system on places like Mars we will improve our understanding of how easily it might have started elsewhere but there is another way to answer this question determining how it started on earth so until we understand how life began we don't know how likely it is or how unique the pathway was that led to life on earth one man who is trying to come up with an answer to this question it's Jack szostak in his lab at Harvard University he's trying to determine how easy it is to create life by making it himself so we work on the origin of life we are trying to do simple experiments in the lab that will give us some

evolved at the same time at the Shostak lab they're focused on two experiments one to work out how primitive cell membranes could grow and divide into daughter cells and the other on RNA replication so we hope to be able to recreate the conditions in lab that allowed life to come about in the first place on the earlier and a big part of that is learning how to make RNA that can undergo spontaneous self-replication without the need for modern-day enzymes dr. Shah stack and his team have already created a protocell from a blob of lipids which contains RNA the sticking point at the moment is working out how to make RNA they can copy itself without relying on a helping hand from RNA enzymes the ultimate goal this is to create from chemicals a simple living system where we can see Darwinian evolution operating the emergence of new functions so in a sense it's it would be a reconstitution of the beginnings of biology in a lab setting one of the things they hope to learn from that of course is how life might have started on the early Earth if it is a difficult process reliant upon various bits of luck or circumstance then it is possible that we are a cosmic fluke one that isn't going to be repeated elsewhere but if experiments like dr. Shah Stax show that life emerges easily then the odds of life appearing elsewhere in the universe look more likely perhaps one day when we're looking into the night sky we'll finally know the answer to the question are we alone you

moonlanding,"Aviation experts frequently remind us that flying on modern jet planes is the safest form of transport. However those assertions are meaningless while the fate of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 remains unknown. It’s more than two years since the Boeing 777 disappeared off the face of the earth. An exhaustive and expensive search in the southern Indian Ocean has failed to turn up anything. It’s due to end soon, which has further distressed the grieving families of the 239 passengers and crew who are presumed dead. Frustration at the lack of clues has led to significant reassessment about MH370, and as Ross Coulthart discovers in this 60 Minutes investigation, there’s now growing evidence that authorities have been ignoring more credible theories about what might have brought the jet down.",MH370: Special Investigation - Part two | 60 Minutes,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmw0evr6uvI,0,2097166,7598,906,0,Dmw0evr6uvI,"the Jet Into The Ocean but our Investigation reveals that the only Possible Scenario on The Evidence Is that a skilled Pilot did Deliberately Land the 777 on the Water and The Strongest Clue Is a piece of evidence Malaysia hasn't even examined A Small Piece of Wing Called the Flaperon Been Caused by the Force of Water as it was Crash-Landed by a Pilot The Momentum of That dragging That Little Flapper on Through the Water Would be Absolutely Enormous the Force of the Water Is Jagged Edge Did We See it wasn't broken off it was broken off it Would be A Clean Break?

of first man before to hit theaters and here are my thoughts and in case you're wondering no I did not bring Pete with me all right right up front guys this will contain spoilers if you would like to bookmark this video and come back to watch it after you've seen this movie I will give you a second to do that right now alrighty let's get going I really wanted to love this movie I mean it's Neil Armstrong it's Apollo its Apollo 11 it's mid-century its space history it's everything that I love but the whole thing didn't totally do it for me now my favorite thing about this movie was with that question that the technical elements I mean it is an absolutely beautiful movie there is so much incredible attention to detail in the hardware there's an x-15 panel with the altitude dial clicking over and it really does look like the old 1950s dials that if you've seen pictures of the cockpit you know where in there there's of course shots inside the Gemini 8 spacecraft as well as Apollo 11 but the command and lunar modules and there's the texture in the dials everything about the coloration is so stunning and like I said the color palette of the entire movie is just so perfectly mid-century there are moments and there are some shots especially in the gemenese sequences where you look at it and the framing is such that it looks it looks like the old b-roll and the old pictures that I and presumably many people watching this video have spent hours looking at it's really quite stunning and the camerawork in some of those shots it's just super super shaky and you're sort of like I saw I managed to see it in IMAX it read you're like okay now I'm a little bit seasick because an x-15 under the pylon on the wing of the b-52 would be pretty jolly they actually had a tractor seat in that airplane and that rocket plane because that was the best way to dampen the vibrations on the pilots spine little fun fact for you the other thing that deserves a mention in terms of cinematography is the beautiful use of space in the Armstrong home so not only does the color palette this beautiful mid-century color palette carry over from vintage NASA to vintage Neil Armstrong types but the way some shots framed either him or Jan Armstrong where the family indoor frames down hallways was really quite striking I mean this was honestly just a a beautiful movie the gorgeous cinematography however did not totally make up for what I really felt was an odd lack of humanity from Neil Armstrong's character and this was actually my biggest concern going into this movie Neil Armstrong's career was incredible with the x-15 yemeni program and apollo 11 of course but he was notoriously very stoic and reserved which aren't necessarily qualities that make for a dynamic main character in a biopic so quick sidebar for a personal story I never met Neil Armstrong but he did review the first two print articles that I ever wrote which was one of the most terrifying things ever my first to print articles were for timeline the Ohio Historical Society's magazine and they were about Neil one it was a two-part series one about him as an x-15 pilot and one about his work with dinosaur because he actually developed the launch abort procedure for this space plane that never got off the ground and he did give me notes from the editor that I was working with so I never spoke to him directly or got an email directly it came through the editor and everything that he picked up on were things that only an engineer would pick up on the one that I can remember off the top of my head I had translated or converted rather the landing speed of the x-15 from 200 knots if my memory serves 200 knots to about 220 miles per hour and his comment was in aviation we measure airspeed and knots not miles and I just was scared of it but he was an engineer through and through the narrative in the movie focuses on the until now little known fact that Neil Armstrong lost his infant daughter in 1962 not long before he joined the astronaut corps and this becomes the driving force behind his entire emotional experience throughout the movie it sort of becomes the jumping-off point for his struggle with mortality to be at odds with his engineering brain that can look at everything very logically and of course it only gets worse because he experiences a lot of death as the movie goes on not only does he lose his daughter at the beginning he loses a handful of his dear friends he experienced the deaths of Eliot see Ted Freeman Cece Williams Gus Grissom ed white and Roger Chaffee and probably more when he was at Edwards so as the movie goes through all of these deaths Neal starts to have visions of Karen everywhere from when he's training and blacks out to when he sees other children playing at a friend's house and it well he kind of maintains an outward even strain doesn't really demonstrate emotion he also grows increasingly withdrawn into himself and spends time looking up longingly at the moon and lashing out at his friends and not really talking about the reality of the fact that he might die on any of his missions so this struggle with emotion and sort of repressing it and having it boil out at various points it follows Neil all the way to the moon to the crux the emotional crux of the movie after the landing he's standing at the rim of a crater and he has one of Karen's bracelets in his hand and he drops it into the dark abyss of this crater in a shot so strikingly reminiscent of old Rose throwing the heart of the ocean back into the sea at the end of Titanic the whole emotional arc in the movie kind of made me wonder if Neil Armstrong was really the kind of man to cry on the moon would he have been put on a lunar mission at all now I've been deep in the weeds researching the development of NASA's astronaut corps for a while now I have a project the announcement about it is pending leave it there for now and I've I'm pretty convinced that for NASA at the time going to the moon military test pilots were exactly the people who should have been on those lunar missions these were men who through the combination of in straining and a constant radio babble to keep them occupied were able to stave off any intense emotional reactions to the reality of oh my god I am standing on the moon looking at the earth and it's a quarter of a million miles away because can you imagine the emotional strain and intensity that that would bring personally it's the deep-space epa's that get me as like way scarier to even think about but I digress it was strange that this emotional climax of the movie which was coupled with a complete silence which I know was not exactly a common occurrence on the moon for the aforementioned keeping emotional panic attacks at bay that combined with the presentation of all the drama leading up to that moment from the space end of things didn't evoke the emotion for me that Neill felt in that moment so thinking about that moment more I think it might be that that moment of sadness on the moon is meant to invoke this idea that even though there were 400,000 people that worked on Apollo and who got Neil Armstrong to the moon he ultimately felt like an island because of this emotional strain that he never let out that kind of kept him just blocked off from the world in a way and this isolation of Neil Armstrong is really solidified by how much all the other characters very few of them are really explored and developed aside from Jan Armstrong ed white gets a decent amount of development and Dave Scott is in there for a bit and Buzz Aldrin is there and he's bald and mean but everyone else is sort of thrown out by first name there's no real sense of any kind of like camaraderie between the astronauts there's no sense of like what it was like for him to be an astronaut it's sort of all drama at home the occasional fun moments with the kids that feel almost bizarre next to his robotic self at work that struck me is really odd because I've actually read all the Apollo mission transcripts and the Germany transcripts and the mercury transcripts and mission reports and by all accounts Neil Armstrong you know had a motion in space there are a couple of my my favorite moments that I'll mention is stand out so there is a quote on Apollo 11 131 hours 42 minutes and 30 seconds into the flight where he said to Mike Collins you ready for your underwear Mike you ready for your underwear you ready for your underwear and I found this and I was very confused by this when I read it and I actually had the chance to ask Mike Collins what it was about and that video is right up here if you'd like to see the entire exchange but Mike Collins told me that he's pretty sure that it was Neal kind of like gently teasing him that while they were suiting up before separating the lunar module from the command service module that Mike didn't have a liquid-cooled garment because he wasn't going to the moon so that he just put on regular underwear whatever that meant in this situation so there is a sense of humor there you've also read there's this great exchange between the crew on the far side of the Moon after the landing they stayed in orbit before they came home and they're not in contact with the earth they don't really have much to do they're just kind of hanging out for a bit you know minding things but Neil and Buzz are really kind of enjoying going through all of their samples and explaining it all and sharing it all with my Collins and you have this sense of like this is a crew they weren't the best of friends they weren't you know Apollo 12 buddies but they they were really kind of excited to be there together and to be sharing this experience and I kind of missed that even he's portrayed as being so extremely robotic on Gemini 8 when when he got into orbit that was this first time getting into orbit his reaction was that's fantastic boy here we go for me I really wanted to see some of that like happy excited Neil because it felt like there was just too much sad Neil to the point where it was just long pained glances and thoughtfulness and no discussion of wow I'm in space for the first time hey look it's the moon which is ultimately the human response to being in space and being at the moon or so I would imagine having never been there myself but there was it it felt too stark in a way that it felt unhuman the other thing worth mentioning is that this isolation of Neil comes to the point where some major emotional moments were almost downplayed the Apollo one fire is of course in there because he did lose his good friend ed white and it's shown from inside the capsule you see them during the plagues a test and you see the flames and then it switches to a shot of outside the capsule and you hear sound like a muffled bomb and that's it when in reality that fire ruptured the hall and the flames came out into the white room where it did significant damage of the pad and all the pad crews who rushed to try to get the astronauts out before the hall ruptured they were burned they were injured there was a chance to bring out the idea that there are a lot of people involved and that the toll is greater than just the astronauts that it's there was I think a lot to do there and I think it was very an odd decision to show the Apollo 1 fire ending in a thud as opposed to an actual inferno that damaged a lot more than just the spacecraft and injured a lot of people it was an odd that was an odd very odd decision for me I felt strange seeing that for some reason all right I have to bring it up because every review I'm seeing is mentioning it and of course everyone will this movie will not surpass Apollo 13 as the best space movie for me now when I saw that movie for the first time when I was a kid I knew very little about the Apollo missions I knew they happened in the 60s I knew they were done by capital a astronauts advisors I didn't know what they looked like I just I liked space and I was interested in this idea that people had been to the moon and when I watched that movie it it kind of changed everything for me I I learned that it wasn't Capitol a faceless astronauts who went to the moon it was people with families and stories and that movie for me captured so much humanity in the Apollo missions that it completely changed the way I looked not only at space and about my own interest in Nepal about how I look at science that movie brought so much humanity into something that was so technical it was incredible and and somehow even though I knew they got back safely because I had read encyclopedia Encarta at the time on a cd-rom it built so much tension and every time I watch it I am still struck by the humanity in the story in those little moments that make the crew feel like people not just characters not just astronauts and it's still tense every single time they get to the the long ionization blackout when they're you know you see Jim Lovells son in the as a cadet watching on TV to the family I can't no I can't look away from the screen I know what's coming but I can't look away from the screen this movie did not do that for me this movie did not have the same depth of character through those little moments that I felt like I came away with a deeper understanding and appreciation of either the astronauts or the missions it it didn't have that depth for me that made it stand out as something that will will linger if that makes sense and you know same thing I know a lot more about Apollo now I know how it's gonna end I know how the Gemini eight ends I know how the LRV crash ends I know how the x18 ends I still didn't feel any tension and and I don't know what I and I chalk that up for me knowing what I loved about movies like this is it didn't bring in that emotional element for me but maybe that's just me maybe you guys have a different experience of it so once you've had a chance to see the movie let me know your thoughts let me know what things you absolutely loved in the film what things you didn't love and whether or not you agree with me that humanity is a good thing to have in our astronauts of course guys leave everything in the comment section down below and of course you can also follow me all across social media for daily vintage space content I'm on Instagram Facebook and of course Twitter and of course anything else you would like to see me cover in future episodes leave all that in the

moonlanding,"Jalen Rose and David Jacoby react to Andre Iguodala's interview on ""The Breakfast Club,"" asserting the Golden State Warriors downplayed his injury publicly during the 2018 Western Conference Finals vs. the Houston Rockets. They discuss what his claim means for Kevin Durant, and how it might affect where he goes in 2019 NBA free agency.

More on ESPN.com: http://www.espn.com","What Andre Iguodala's 'The Breakfast Club' interview might mean for KD, Warriors | Jalen & Jacoby",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eb3zfWEPo4I,0,277435,2353,142,669,eb3zfWEPo4I,andre igudala was on a show that you've been on before The Breakfast Club and he talked about a lot of things but one of the things that was most interesting was his description of his experience with an injury during the playoffs with Golden State here's what he had to say I missed the last three games of the Houston series this is last year it goes to game seven and we barely got of the series and now they're looking at me like when you coming back and I had a fractured leg but it's being put out there like he's got a bone bruise and I'm like no it's fractured so I'm fighting with the team I'm fighting with the people I'm fighting with the media and my teammates ask me every day how I'm feeling so with Durant he's getting it from everywhere - interesting it sounds familiar doesn't it Jalen Rose well one thing that should be noted is Nick Vidal he had some information he spoke with people and the Warriors are saying that no information gets out without the player and the player's agent co-signing it take that as you will but Andre Gonzalez said exactly what he said how do you feel about honoring a good Dallas description of his experience with an injury in the playoffs and what happened with Kevin Durant what he's describing is basically two separate things that after this comments and what we saw happened with KD and Kawhi I'm gonna get to him is gonna basically ball back to two things either misreporting which in an era of gambling when it's legal can be something that's not good for the game and or malpractice so let me get this right we both understand that I have a bone bruise but you're gonna tell the other players on the team and the media that I have a bone bruise but I really have a fracture leg that's few and far between based on the information that should be getting delivered from a professional franchise and by the way I got a couple of examples for you Isiah Thomas remember the Celtics were the number one seed in the East and he was averaging 28 points of course well his injury got misdiagnosed and before you know it he's in Cleveland a couple of teams later he's in Denver barely playing minutes on a number to see how about Kawhi Leonard who had to endure the noise of playing nine games his final year in Toronto got traded to the Raptors ending up beating the Golden State Warriors primarily because Kevin Durant was injured I sold everybody that his workout did not go well on any level on Friday there's no way he could have been cleared on Monday and yes it probably was acknowledged as a calf injury but if you ever saw him walk with ice on it looked like it was on his Achilles know what I figured Allah is exposing something that we've already been saying and it's kind of being whispered off wax so now it's official because he said yeah I mean there is that detail that his agent and himself had to sign off whatever information the Warriors put out fine take that as you will but the fact that he's going and speaking into a microphone and and sort of echoing something that happened to him to something that happened to Kevin Durant is an indication of a sort of lack of 100% faith and trust between the organization and the player when it comes to injuries and how they're handled and how they're put out there and my question for you is this Jalen like Andre Iguodala is not a rookie he's a veteran he's known for his basketball IQ and his intelligence off the court he knows what he's doing why do you think he would say this right now during this summer with Kevin Durant about to become a free agent because he feel bad for KD he saw his brother trying to get out there knowing that if the Warriors were up 3-1 Katie wouldn't play they wouldn't bail in 3-1 so he saw him get out there knowing that he hasn't necessarily had a full practice with him and so he saw he got injured a lot worse and it's going to cost him a season so that now as a player emboldened you to speak your truth and especially when it's with the same team it's not like they played on different teams and they're sharing this information they play on the exact same team and so while we're talking so much and rightfully so about poor teams or losing teens when they have a level of dysfunction we're starting to see some splintering with the Golden State Warriors you have a 7% owner push Kyle Lowry and get suspended by the NBA we're talking about this Kevin Durant news Andre Iguodala also talked about Mark Jackson being blackballed by the Warriors that led a domino effect throughout the league and we're talking about these players injuries that level of transparency doesn't seem to exist like it should well Vegas has a way of knowing things and they have odds of where Kevin Durant is going to play next year let's take a look at Caesars Sports Book odds of where Katie's gonna play Oh who's the favorite by more than I would expect the Brooklyn Nets Jalen we always talked about him staying with the Warriors you talk about him going to the Knicks does this indicate to you that Kevin Durant could be headed to the Nets and possibly bring Kyrie Irving along with him Vegas builds expensive casinos constantly by getting this stuff right and scooping up all of our money when we feel like we gonna go there and get rich quick and try to gamble it it's has all those odds continue to lend toward him going to the net but I'm going to keep saying what I said if you need to go there to join with Kyrie Irving based on your injury I understand that if he had not gotten hurt I almost believe if he was leaving the Warriors it wasn't gonna be for the Nets because when you leave the Warriors you're walking away from winning you're walking away from the money when you go to New York you gotta be on the big stage and that's msg Brooklyn just got a team a couple of years ago the Knicks fans have been storied over decades so it's gonna be interesting to see how it plays out thanks so much for watching ESPN on YouTube for more sports analysis and highlights download the ESPN app and for live streaming and

at a pre-wedding celebration this wedding they're saying is a hundred million dollars how much do beyond that you did it I don't know what her fee was but you can imagine getting Beyonce to come perform at your wedding in India is nothing cheap to happen now it's India's richest man Mukesh Ambani he was honoring his door to Isha with the pre-wedding celebration the actual wedding hasn't even taken place yet so she the daughter's wedding fellow billionaire AJ para mas son anand so that's gonna be held at their home which is a 27 story palace so hundred million dollars to them is like a hundred thousand still a waste of money though what a pre-wedding ticket man I mean if you got it they want to sell a brand a wedding is thirty minutes at the most so they want to celebrate it their families do donate a lot of money as well they donate a lot of food a lot of money and I have a donation a hundred dollar wedding to the donation they got it they way they want to they want to and when I have it they can have it then that means no divorce is even remotely in the picture at all that's what the prenup says no divorce no none well now let's talk about marriage boot camp hip hop addition that is coming so we TV and that comes on January 10th now some of the people on the show include Soulja Boy and Nia Riley waka and Tami Lomo and Carlton Jessica dime and Shawn Williams and little fizz and Tiffany Campbell here's the trailer ten days one house but hip-hop superstar this house about to be so late they lived their lives in the spotlight in the hardcore world of hip-hop people are accusing walk up cheating the stakes are high and the emotions run even higher this the stress bling I'm not wearing a marching one anywhere you should be worried I hope you find whatever you're looking for see that's why you can't try to kill yourself in front of people because people have zero empathy and they try to use it against you later on I wasn't here Riley talking to Soulja Boy that you posed to be my wife my booth my wife would never do that come on now you guys should get that little try to kill you're not married but we never will be and never will this kind of attitude me oh wow sounds explosive all right now Selena this series is going to be coming to Netflix the family is actually producing it they said Selena will always have a lasting place in music history and we feel great responsibility to do justice to her memory but the series viewers will finally get the full history of Selena our family and the impact she has had on all of our lives now for those who don't know who is Selena a bidi bidi bamba' she's a huge superstar that was actually shot and killed by the woman who managed her fan club after they found out she was embezzling money so he said a bidi bidi Bom Bom Bom bet you don't know that song oh I thought no the thing I thought that I thought I just thought a bidi bidi Bom by was it everybody knows they always saying by Selena graduate jail okay I think JLo was Lena for a long time all right another thing that's coming to Netflix is conversations with a killer the Ted Bundy tapes it's a true crime docu-series about serial killer Ted Bundy it's a four-part series it's gonna have previously unheard audio of interviews with Bundy while he was on death row in Florida okay people get when they get money from there where did that money go then the money goes to the victims families and all that I'm sure it depends on what situation was worked out and you know like I know all right now Kevin Hart ever since he stepped down from the Oscars they're trying to figure out what can we do to keep this show chugging along apparently according to Variety they are freaking out now some reps are saying that they're bummed that Kevin didn't stay the course and serve as an example and just weather the storm and you know be an example for future shows but they're also saying what's gonna happen next they might not have a host at all that's one option and that's happened before in Oscars history of course that could be very dull because it's already kind of a dull show yes it is or they could do some type of Saturday Night Live style cluster is what they call it and get different stars to come through to keep the show moving along it's also not a well paid gig so I think a lot of people feel like it's not worth it it's $15,000 I think is what they get paid and it's not like it really does anything you know for you so with all of the vetting and things like that going on some people feel like it's not worth it exactly Oscar's that's your problem I don't give a damn about the Oscars I can take it or leave it but who actually would want to host that gig when they're gonna go to your life as you fear you just became the President of the United States of America and they gonna hold the president of the Unites States of America it's a less of a standard then they go home oh the Oscar host all right now time's up let's talk about that campaign right now they are actually you know coming together Ava Duvernay Reese Witherspoon Geena Davis Kerry Washington and other big stars they're going to do an auction a celebrity auction to benefit the legal fund for the times up movement now so far they've raised more than 22 million dollars since the campaign started back in January at the Golden Globes but some of the things they'll be auctioning off an opportunity to attend the post-production session with Ava Duvernay on her Netflix miniseries Central Park 5 could be also a coffee date with Geena Davis and a meet-and-greet with Reese Witherspoon at the big little live season 2 premiere or a Kerry Washington at her Broadway show American Sun so that's auction is going down I'll take you Broadway tickets now take being on set with people I'm not gonna lie big little lives was a great series I don't know if you guys watch that but they have a season coming up that show was incredible actually watch the entire series on the flight to Johannesburg that's how long that flight was all right I'm Angela Yee and that is your rumor report"

 UFO simply stands for “unidentified flying object”. So even if the UFOs on this list are not alien
 in nature, the point is that we have no idea what they actually are, and we likely never
 will. 19. KOCO 5 News: An Oklahoma news station randomly
 captures a low-flying UFO during a cutaway shot shortly before commercial. KOCO 5 News later shows this footage to the
 Science Museum of Oklahoma for verification. Experts there said that it was not a meteorite
 and declared it an actual UFO. The President of another organization called
 the Oklahoma Astronomy Society later said they thought it could be a meteorite, and
 as with any good UFO sighting, the debate continues to this day. 18. This perplexing UFO sighting was taken during
 a Fox News broadcast on the same day as President Obama’s Inauguration. Two glowing lights appear to the right of
 the Washington Monument followed by a pale orb-like UFO. The UFO almost looks transparent and metallic
 as comes into sight for only a moment and then fades away. Some people are saying that this is a camera
 malfunction involving the two red lights on the monument itself. I would definitely like to hear more about
 this possible malfunction if someone could explain it to me. 17. In 2013 a camera on a weather tower detected
 something very abnormal hovering over Lincoln, which is the capital of Nebraska. Look in the bottom righthand corner to see
 it. The station’s local meteorologist had no
 explanation for the UFO. He went on to say that he does not believe
 it was a weather-related incident and therefore is unqualified to comment on what it could
 be. A Lincoln resident caught this flashing object
 on tape the same morning and sent it into the news network. By the time the sun came up, the UFO was gone
 without  a trace. 16. It’s just another normal news day in Cincinnati,
 Ohio until a UFO reveals itself in broad daylight. The stunned news anchor is able to track the
 fast-moving UFO with his finger until it is completely gone from sight, and his confused
 reaction is the same as almost everyone who has seen this video since. Some people have tried to explain this sighting
 as the planet Venus, which is only visible during certain times of the year, but since
 the UFO clearly travels in front of a building at one point, I don’t think that this particular
 explanation is possible. 15. A live news broadcast in Montreal shows a
 strange flying object in the dark city sky. Pay attention to the area just left of the
 newscaster. Some people say that this is clearly a meteorite,
 but then again, other people say it’s far too large and slow-moving to be one. Whatever it is, the object definitely appears
 to become larger as it draws closer to earth. Maybe it burned up in the earth’s atmosphere,
 and this is it falling to Earth. Either way, we’ll likely never know if this
 was a meteorite or an actual spacecraft. 14. A YouTuber named timelinesoon was watching
 a German television show when suddenly this popped up on his screen. The UFO hangs around for a bit before silently
 gliding away. If anybody speaks German, please let me know
 what is being said here. Tell me if they give the name of the location
 and if this story has anything to do with unusual alien activity at all. 13. This BBC broadcast picked up something so
 strange that they later asked viewers to call in if they saw it themselves. A news anchor is casually reporting on a normal
 news story when something very unusual zooms by the webcam in the background. I personally wouldn’t be surprised if it
 was a bug. Somebody else mentioned that it could be light
 reflecting off of an overhead aircraft on a cloudy day. Let me know if you think these two possible
 explanations seem reasonable. 12. Parkerdonaldmusic: In 2012, a band called
 The Black Keys was playing live in Chicago at an annual music festival called Lollapalooza. Look at these brief clips and see if you can
 spot something in the sky as the cameras pan across the audience. At least two tiny unidentified flying objects
 appear to dart around in the spotlight using sharp and sporadic flight patterns. I’m not an expert, but I don’t think comets
 move like that, so I’m not sure what it is. 11. This official YouTube video comes from Channel
 4 News in Britain. A news anchor named Tom Watson is reading
 off a teleprompter when something flies over the live green screen behind him. Slow the footage down and you can clearly
 see a white saucer descend across the city skyline. Some people have pointed out that this could
 be a drone, but this footage was taken in 2011 – way before drones were publicly available. So I guess this was either a government-owned
 drone or an actual alien spacecraft, but we’ll likely never know for sure. 10. The Keiser Report is an English-speaking news
 show based out of Moscow, Russia. There’s a moment during the 457th episode
 that captures a UFO zooming by overhead. Some people claim that this is a bird while
 others say that this is way too fast. I’m not sure if this is a bird or something
 else, but when you slow the footage down, you can clearly see that it has the shape
 of saucer. 9. One day a lot of people in Cornwall, Australia
 all saw the exact same UFO and livestreamed it on social media. The greyish UFO seemed to dematerialize and
 reappear before their very eyes. All three of those videos were posted within
 10 minutes of each other by people who had never met before. The next day the strange UFO was back for
 its second appearance. These videos were taken on July 17 and July
 18th of 2017. The shimmering UFO has not been reported since. 8. This live weather channel footage was recorded
 by a person named Jittery Kitty and uploaded onto their Twitter account. A 
 weather station is tracking Hurricane Irma when suddenly a huge ball of light falls directly
 from the sky, hits the ground and then bounces back upwards until it is out of view. Meanwhile, the meteorologist either pretends
 not to notice or genuinely wasn’t looking at the live feed when it happened. This bizarre moment may have been lost forever
 if not for one Twitter user’s quick-thinking. 7. Fox News accidentally caught a UFO flying
 around Washington DC one day moments before cutting away to a commercial break. The lightning-fast UFO leaves the camera frame
 as quickly as it came, disappearing from sight before the news anchor is even able to get
 out three words. I find it interesting how many UFO sightings
 occur around monuments and other landmarks. Let me know if you agree and why you think
 this happens so often. 6. On April 5th of 2016, this mysterious UFO
 was seen hovering around the International Space Station at 7:23 in the morning during
 a NASA livestream. A flat disc slowly rises on the blue horizon
 in the distance. It grows larger and larger and then appears
 to briefly invert itself while continuing to surface. I have no idea what this thing could be, so
 please give me your best guess. As far as I know, NASA has yet to give an
 official explanation. 5. A YouTuber named JulieG797 was watching live
 BBC news coverage of a worker’s strike in Hong Kong when he catches what seems to be
 undeniable evidence of a UFO. The mysterious green light hangs around the
 top of a building for only moments before shooting straight up into the sky. This footage was taken directly from the television
 screen and seems very hard, if not impossible, to fake. Right now people are mostly debating if the
 light is too big to be a quadcopter drone. I guess it could be a drone, but if not, I
 think this very well may be a legitimate alien UFO sighting. 4. This live recording was shot somewhere in
 the country of Turkey. The news report itself starts out normally
 enough until a bystander notices an object in the distance and points it out to the rest. A group soon gathers around to gawk at what
 appears to be a large amount of UFOs in the sky. The fact that this video ends before anything
 else happens makes me think that it could be fake, or maybe an electronic disturbance
 jammed the cameras. If anyone in Turkey knows more about this
 video, please let me know. 3. Many people routinely watch NASA’s space
 streams in hopes of catching a glimmer of extraterrestrial life. One such observer noticed an odd moment on
 the NASA stream in January of 2016 and decided to call them out on it. It’s impossible to deny that a tiny fast-moving
 spec definitely zoomed across the background twice. Tell me if you think the astronaut was trying
 to cover something up with his hand, or if that was just a coincidence. I definitely want to hear from anyone who
 has seen other similar things on a NASA feed as well. 2. A large storm in Oklahoma is nothing special,
 but the two UFOs caught during a live television broadcast in April of 2017 definitely are. Two plump dots in the distance move around
 in patterns that defy the natural laws of physics. The UFOs appear to start and stop in tiny
 bursts, and when you look closely, you can see a trail of light beneath them as they
 move towards the sky. Many people suspect that this is either extraterrestrial
 aircraft or else some sort of advanced rocket propulsion technology that the general public
 does not know about. Before we get to number 1, my name is Chills

 of San Diego over the water. Two high-tech fighter jets immediately took
 pursuit. Later one of them would describe what they
 saw as a 40-foot long tic tac with no wings. What you just saw wasn’t declassified until
 thirteen years later by the Department of Defense in 2017. All major news networks have verified this
 tape, so I can honestly say it’s 100 percent real. The Pentagon had a secret 22 million dollar
 UFO research program called the Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program that was discontinued
 2012. This fact, compared with this video, really
 makes you wonder how many other UFO videos are waiting in the vault for declassification."

The Mars rover, Curiosity, is the latest in a long line of missions to Mars: landers sent to scoop its soil and study its rocks, orbiters sent to map its valleys and ridges.

They are all asking the same question. Did liquid water once flow on this dry and dusty world? Did it support life in any form? And are there remnants left to find? The science that comes out of these missions may help answer a much larger, more philosophical question.

Is our planet Earth the norm, in a galaxy run through with life-bearing planets? Or is Earth a rare gem, with a unique make-up and history that allowed it to give rise to living things? On Mars, Curiosity has spotted pebbles and other rocks commonly associated with flowing water. 

It found them down stream on what appears to be an ancient river fan, where water flowed down into Gale Crater. This shows that at some point in the past, Mars had an atmosphere, cloudy skies, and liquid water flowing. So what could have turned it into the desolate world we know today? 

One process that very likely played a role goes by the unscientific name, ""sputtering."" Like the other planets in our solar system, Mars is lashed by high-energy photons from the Sun. When one of these photons enters the atmosphere of a planet, it can crash into a molecule, knocking loose an electron and turning it into an ion. The solar wind brings something else: a giant magnetic field. When part of the field grazes the planet, it can attract ions and launch them out into space. 

Another part might fling ions right into the atmosphere at up to a thousand kilometers per second. The ions crash into other molecules, sending them in all directions like balls in a game of pool. Over billions of years, this process could have literally stripped Mars of its atmosphere, especially in the early life of the solar system when the solar wind was more intense than it is today. 

Sputtering has actually been spotted directly on another dead planet, Venus. The Venus Express mission found that solar winds are steadily stripping off lighter molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. They escape the planet on the night side... then ride solar breezes on out into space.

This process has left Venus with an atmosphere dominated by carbon dioxide gas... a heat trapping compound that has helped send surface temperatures up to around 400 degrees Celsius. The loss of Venus' atmosphere likely took place over millions of years, especially during solar outbursts known as coronal mass ejections. 

If these massive blast waves stripped Venus and Mars of an atmosphere capable of supporting life how did Earth avoid the same grim fate?  We can see the answer as the solar storm approaches earth. Our planet has what Mars and Venus lack - a powerful magnetic field generated deep within its core.
 
This protective shield deflects many of the high-energy particles launched by the Sun. In fact, that's just our first line of defense. Much of the solar energy that gets through is reflected back to space by clouds, ice, and snow. 

The energy that earth absorbs is just enough to power a remarkable planetary engine: the climate. It's set in motion by the uneveness of solar heating, due in part to the cycles of day and night, and the seasons. That causes warm, tropical winds to blow toward the poles, and cold polar air toward the equator.  

Wind currents drive surface ocean currents. This computer simulation shows the Gulf Stream winding its way along the coast of North America. This great ocean river carries enough heat energy to power the industrial world a hundred times over.
 
It breaks down in massive whirlpools that spread warm tropical waters over northern seas. Below the surface, they mix with cold deep currents that swirl around undersea ledges and mountains. Earth's climate engine has countless moving parts: tides and terrain, cross winds and currents -- all working to equalize temperatures around the globe.

Over time, earth developed a carbon cycle and an effective means of regulating green house gases. In our galaxy, are still-born worlds like Mars the norm?

seven days entombed in a plastic box underground in New York the following year he tried to stay encased in a block of ice for 72 hours and 2002 he spent 36 hours standing on top of a 30 meter pillar without a safety net you get the idea but none of that was as mysterious or weird when I met him back in 2001 why does he do that I'm sure you're not going to tell me and date since and you're famous in this country as well for a period in a car advert and doing tricks as well card tricks excellent what do we get with you are you an illusionist are you a trickster what is it are you stunt man what are you how would you describe yourself and just this gentleman yeah yeah is this part of the show this this sort of meeting moody person and the stare and the eyes and all that sort of thing that's just you that's just you the eye and the hand and what is that what is the eye on the head let's see that again protection um um Adonis a protection from death and I said good because I'm dying doing this do you want an explanation I'm just pleased you're speaking that's that's great that's great okay so I was I was in the greenroom yeah and everybody was in the greenroom and we were all talking and the show was going on it was I think it was earlier I think was like 7:00 or 7:30 and while everybody was talking the show was going on and these are all family and friends of everybody and nobody was watching their friends go on so I was like I'm gonna make sure that that the blade will stall out and look so I was thinking a card trick would be too boring it's not gonna stop the people in the green room from chatting so I I last-minute came up with that idea and then I'm so I did the whole thing which I thought was funny myself but when I was exiting last I'm glad one of us though but when I was exiting the studio I had to walk past and I just took the mic off and went and when I walked past the green room I looked over into the room and every person in the room was going like they just see the craziest thing I was at home bang and what happened was my hair turned gray right after that right after that yeah I think that was wicked and cry I think it's a good look if you don't feel sorry for him you could see how it was the longest six nights of my life I was very happy when you came to the box when I was in the box in London four days and when you held me over on me yes I tested we tested water that you were drinking and whatever that was amazing up at Tower Bridge but it is incredible don't feel so bad about it because I've traded off and ever since so sobbing I mean it's been them it's been the making of me deep and the thing is that was then this is now what is the new David blink is a lot has happened in between you've stepped back from a lot of the big stunts the death-defying stunts year when I hardly I had my daughter in 2011 and I did one more stunt where isn't a bunch of electricity unless not risky because I always study and train and research how far you can push the human body without going to the breaking point that's always been my curiosity because if you go to the breaking point before what I think they say like when most people like most top athletes when they train if they're Full Tilt they're only still training at 40% so usually I think you have a big reserve within that you can push a little bit further on okay well you're not going to stop your heart or bury you under grande or whatever what are you going to do for his knowledge issue was the news no I'm gonna just show you this stuff that I would have done but the stuff that I think you know I'll just show you here so can I just ask you so do you call yourself a magician or an illusionist yeah it doesn't matter same one of the same yeah so now what I'm gonna have you both do for me if you don't mind is um can you just you take this deck and look at the cards make sure they're all different and you do the same just look at the card to make sure all they're all different yeah good and I guess you could show and you could show this good Oh perfect and can you good and can you make the BEC neat watch they don't spill cuz we only have two decks make them neat good perfect yeah and you know what can you can you behind your back give it a just give it a little mix but watch you don't spill them yeah good right all done great well done perfect now look I'm showing you the cards are completely new shuffled behind your back I shuffled as well yeah so I'm gonna place one card in a specific location in the deck so I place one card in a specific location that's it okay um this and you also mix behind your back okay look at all of your cards yeah and make sure that nobody can see which ever one you want oh just look at him no turn the deck face down turn it face down and spread them - yes spread them to aim and spread them like a magician yeah and take one but do not look at it just take one and hold it in your hands and do not look at it great and the rest we don't need perfect so here's the idea this is a deck they you shuffled can you for the first time show everybody the card that you took you could and I could see it it doesn't matter the five of spades fair yep now to be fair if you want to change hmm you can meaning you took that card yeah but you can have a different one nobody ever changes but you can because I don't want you to think that maybe I had set something up so you can change if you want okay it's up to you yeah I'll change who you are gonna change yeah to what card tan of Hearts are you sure yes you're certain yeah can you say a number up to forty say number up to four out loud say yeah 31 31 I'm gonna give you the deck that you shuffled and can you take all of the cards out take all of them good and you said ten of the parts or two of Hearts kind of kind of hearts and you said 31 yeah the ten of Hearts is the 31st card count through them one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty two one two two twenty three four and five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty wait and you said ten of Hearts thirty one I did let's see if you got it well that's that's magic it's magic now now it's possible maybe that I got lucky maybe I somehow hit it just by coincidence so we're gonna do that again so wait can you see one from in here see one inside but don't say he's gonna guess your card you agree he doesn't know what card you're thinking of yes yeah yeah that's good I'm aiming are you right-handed or left-handed right can you hold your left hand palm up for me hold your left hand palm so no no get rid of the car and hold written up towards me I'm not making it this way no no this and don't say your card okay okay put your hand on top of the deck carefully don't drop them go ahead good as soon as you say they don't say your card yet but as soon as you say it you're gonna guess exactly where it is and it will be exactly there again I doubt that but I have to say your card out loud Queen of hop the three of Hearts Queen it was a Queen of Hearts if you're not sure you can change yeah a queen of heart I'm saying if you want a different card you can change it five seconds if you want five four three two one what card do Queen of Hearts yeah it doesn't matter Eamon wherever you want it to be it will be exactly there okay just say it no say it out loud first second third fourth if you go too big it'll take a long to take this up six the six car yeah Queen of Hearts six do you want to change count to the sixth card one one two two three and remember you shut up for five six yeah no no she meant from the other side turn them over yeah exactly one yep two - great three four five I've yet and show everybody the the next card show everybody the card that was the next one which is the two and the none of the deuces are wild deuces are wild yeah yeah yeah yeah it deuce is about um you can yeah you can you can we count out two cards - cards - more common yeah one yep and show everybody the next one - sorry the three means your card it jumped out of the deck yes folding in air the King of Hearts and it landed onto your wristwatch get under there turn your wrist let them see show them wait show them on and show them your watch before you know that's that is magic David Blaine is on tour real or magic tickets on sale now we've got to go to the weather Wow nice watch you

Well, where better to visit a T-34 than to come to Russia. We’re in a little town Padikovo a tad west of Moscow, to have a look at their T-34/85. It’s the middle of June, it’s absolutely freezing, but my Russian Camera crew says it’s kind of warm so we’re going to do this anyway. The T-34 was doing quite well, but it needed a little bit of an upgrade to the gun. The 76mm was starting to show its age, so by August of 43, they started to investigating as to whether or not you could but an 85mm into it. Well the answer was Yes you could, but you needed to increase the turret ring diameter to about 1600 millimeters, quite an increase over the 1420 of the earlier T-34. This did allow one significant advantage though, and that was you could now put a wider turret with a three man crew. This fixed a significant failing of the older T-34, which was a little bit cramped, and the two man crew were overworked and inefficient. We’re going to look at the T-34 in the usual manner you are now familiar with. We’re going to start at the front and work our way around, look at the engine, and then hop inside. Maybe even take it for a spin. We’ll see. The vehicle’s front hull, 45mm of armor, sloped at 60 degrees, top and bottom. This is sort of a mid production vehicle, it has this small narrow rail in front. Earlier ones had a larger radius and later ones they dispensed with it entirely and just went with a two piece direct weld. If you look at the details of the far left and right wings are two armored plugs. This is for the track tension system. Now there is some misconception that because T-34 had slack unsupported track you didn’t need to tension it. Well this is absolutely wrong. If you don’t keep an unsupported track at the correct level of tension you will walk the track off. So in order to tension the track what you do is you first release a lock which is on the inside of the tank, right in the front corners in the bow. You then take a tool, insert that into here, and then you crank a worm drive, which will then move the idler wheel forwards or backwards. When you’re done you lock the idler wheel back into position, put your plug back in the top, and away you go. Other features on the front, two tow hooks, spare track, and of course a machine gun, a horn and a headlight are on the left. If you want to know a little bit more on the specifications of the tank, well I’ve got Yuri Pasholok here off the screen teaching me the finer points of T-34-ology, and one of the things he points out is the serial number is actually coded. The first character, in this case a four, is the year of manufacture; 1944. The next two characters are the month: 12, December. Lastly, ‘117’ means it was the 177th tank to come off the line that month in Nizhny Tagil. Now, it doesn’t say Nizhny Tagil on this, but there are a couple of features around the tank which indicate that was the plant of manufacture. Every single manufacturing plant had its own little idiosyncrasies which it implemented into the tank. So a T-34 built in one plant was not necessarily identical with a T-34 built in another plant. They were just fit to the same general design and specifications. External Fuel Tanks, 90 Liters, you would have one of course on each side. Now later on in production you were able to put on four of them. These were not part of the fuel system; they were simply extra fuel that you could then pump yourself into the fuel tanks. Moving a bit further forward, this is an access cover for some of the oil, there is one on the far side as well. Now, common to everything else on this tank, it is bolted down. You can’t do any maintenance without tools. So, undo this bolts, lift this up out of the way, undo more bolts, you can finally access your lubricants. Moving forward, this is a post war addition so ignore it. Keep moving, of course you have your hand rails for the tank riders, firing port for personal weapons, the horn, headlight, and finally point to note is the welding. Now if you compare the weld with that on earlier T-34s, especially the early war production ones, you’ll see this is far, far better. About part way through the war, a Soviet Engineer figured out the concept of submerged Arc Welding, which is far more efficient, far faster, far less man hours. The welds that it produced were so strong, that in testing they were stronger than the armor it was welding together. So, improvement there. Finally on the side, an access point here for one of the suspension units. There’s another one you can see here aft of the turret. But also you can see that the turret is on top of it. So in order to do any maintenance, you got to pull the turret off, which is mildly inconvenient. Finally, fuel filler point, and as ever, you’ve got to open up the bolts to gas up the tank. Now, T-34 is not the most refined tank in the world. A perfect example of this is found in the running gear. Now most other tanks you’re going to look at, they’re going to have some sort of mechanism to stop the track from falling apart. There is maybe a clip, or a bolt, if you’ve got a double pin track, like an American system for example, you’ve got end connectors. This, as you can see, there’s absolutely nothing which stops the track pin from working its way out of the track. The only thing that keeps the track together in the end, however, is this ramp. Which if the track pin was worked its way out too far, when it comes forward and hits this ramp it just gets whacked back into place. A somewhat crude technique, however, given how long they expected the tank was going to survive in battle anyway, it really didn’t matter. This wasn’t supposed to last for years and years, it was supposed to last one or two battles, maybe three battles, and chances were by then that your tank was dead or the track was dead, it didn’t matter. The links themselves, 72 per side cast of Hadfield Steel. There were two types of links on each track; 36 of each. One will have the center guide, and the other will have a hole. This hole is used for ice grousers. Basically once every six or so link you’re going to put an ice grouser in here. It gives you a little more traction on particularly loose or slippery surfaces. To propel the tank forward, again this is a bit like the BT we saw before, most tanks are going to have a sprocket wheel. Not so in the case of T-34 and its derivatives. There are rollers in the drive wheel, each of which will mesh with the center guide, and this will propel the tank forward. Now the advantage of this, is that there is no friction. You’re talking about rollers meshing with the teeth. The downside though of course, all of your tractive effort going through a single piece of metal, every other link, and when you start talking about 40 ton tanks, you start getting to a weak point. So at that point, it was about as far as you went, and later tanks you would see more of a conventional sprocket wheel. Moving right back right quick to the main road wheels, 830mm each one, five pairs per side on the Christie Suspension. These particular road wheels are unique to the Nizhny Tagil Factory. Other road wheels for T-34s you see, some are solid, some are spoked, but by a combination of very simple features you can tell where a tank was built, and this is one of the features that Yuri was telling me “Ah ha! Nizhny Tagil tank!” Look around to the back of the tank, we have more armor plate at 45mm thick also well sloped. And you’re starting to come along some of the inefficiency if the back of the tank is as well armored as the front the tank almost, you wonder if that’s the most effective use of the weight. However, that said, if you were to be shot at from the rear, better to have it than not. Dominated by a large access port, undo these bolts and you can open this up, and you can access the starter motor, the transmission, and the steering clutches. Exhaust ports on each side, and the entire plate can be unbolted, as you can see it’s hinged, and you can bring it forward. The 67 and a half liter tanks, I mentioned earlier. It was more often than not that three of the four external tanks would be filled with fuel and the fourth one would have oil in it. Outside of that, underneath, you have the tow hooks as you would expect. These little pipes up here are for smoke dischargers, and you can barely see at the top here a convoy light; small little red bulb. So this particular tank does have a third 90 liter tank on the right hand side. Now the internal fuel capacity was about 680 liters. If you add that to the external tanks it would be expected that, again diesel engine, this tank will go about 300 kilometers, which is actually pretty reasonable. Under the turret we have another access port for a suspension unit. And I’m told another unique Nizhny Tagil feature is this sort of flat triangle on the side of the turret, which apparently most other T-34/85s did not have. So after spinning the turret, we can open up the back hatch. Of course it requires the use of a tool, like everything else on this tank does. However it’s actually pretty simple, it’s just a case of lever it up and pull it back. This reveals to us the V-2-34. It is a V-12 Diesel cranks out about 500 horsepower. The cooling system is about the only thing you can actually access under here. The filler cap is right in the center. There are radiators on each side of the engine, under the louvers here. The capacity of the cooling system is 75 liters. Not much else to be seen from the top here, we’re going to close this up and then open up the transmission compartment. The Transmission Compartment is held in place, there are some relatively quick release springs here, which have already conveniently been half way opened up. Ah ha! And now a nice light…Oh come off oh, it helps if you’re not standing on it. There we go, much better. Underneath, you can see these cooling louvers, they are on a swivel shutter. You can close these up if you need more protection from airburst or aircraft attack. Underneath you can see a large flywheel, which of course transmits the power back to the transmission. If you look down at the very far bottom, you can see the control linkages for the clutches and brakes, there’s one on each side, obviously for steering. You can also see the two multi-cyclone air filters. Unfortunately, if you’ve got to change these air filters out you have to do it usually every 25 hours. You have to pull out these armored louvers first. That will then allow you to access the air filters. It’s not the end of the world because there’s only a couple of bolts in each side, but it’s still a nuisance that you don’t really want to deal with all that much. The maintenance on this is a little bit intense, if after only 10 hours of use you’re supposed to check the clutch plate and make sure it goes six to seven millimeters. If you’re lucky enough to get your engine going 25 hours, you’ve got to clean out your air filters. If your tank lasts for 50 hours of travel, or a thousand kilometers, then things really start getting nasty. You have to start disassembling the suspension to get to get at them. However, if you’re lucky, your tank won’t last that long. You won’t have to do the maintenance; just go and get another tank. There’s a lot of ways of almost falling off this tank by the way. It’s not quite as bad as the Matilda, but it’s pretty nasty. And thus ends Part One. So Part two of course, Turret and inside."

Beale you're a satisfied client of Marines I understand is that correct yeah she did a reading for you not too long ago what you understand you think is is a very good reading yes she did a few simple questions if I may first of all how long did the thing last first of all they're at half an hour I thought half an hour how many names pardon me did she give you during that period of half an hour oh wait half a dozen what happened us and did they all hit not everyone how many of you had a similar sounding like Doreen Maureen that type of thing well are you retired enough to give us a tape recording of that reading done by marine Flynn for you and for your information during your reading Maureen Flynn tried these names are they are on the tape of the reading that you're referring to Alan Alfred Alice and Bill Charlie Colin Connie David Derek Eileen Ellen Florrie Frank Fred George Jim Joe Jon Carin Kathryn Kevin Lillian Lisa Liz Lynn mark Mary Mae Michael Robb Ron Shirley Sidney Stanley Sid and Steve that's 37 names and she also asked you if you could connect with any name beginning with an N or an L and you could not do so now in the ones that were accepted you did accept nine of the 37 that were given these were some of the categories a son a larger a brother a nephew and adopted nephew a grandfather a fellow worker a cousin and the neighbor's dog now that's right of context I'm sorry what context we have a transcript of it right here sir and you may have that transcript to refer to it and the names I think are outlined there all 37 you can I analyze anything you can Anna analyze Encyclopedia Britannica mr. Beale is here because he felt that what he actually got on that tape made sense to him very much so will you welcome please Marie Geller Johnny had been a magician himself and was skeptical I was asked to help prevent any trickery nice to see you thanks we uh we have only met scares me this is scares you well this is yet we just got some things together here and I told them to provide their own props and not to let Yeller or his people anywhere near the also one of our staff members uh did some drawings which have been sealed in an envelope and I'd like you to take your own pace when you feel like you want to try anything you want to try that particular experiment first what else feel for it well yeah sure we start eliminating the ones that do not have the water all right without touching them he is really suspicious no I'm having a hard time with you dad I don't mean to be you're right I really just keep looking okay let me rest a little while all right you know I'm surprised because before this program your producer came and he read me please 40 questions you're gonna ask me well I can ask you all kinds of uh sure if you like if you like my dancing question I have to have time um daren't we're back your brewery was telling me you don't feel what strong tonight is that strong it's not all tonight right now I'm feel I'm feeling being pressed and then I can I'm not trying to pressure I really not yeah you're not telling me well will you try that or that well I thought that was the idea of of no I'm not I'm not sense which again James turned the page of a telephone directory without touching it and you claimed to have done that with psychic power yes now you're prepared to demonstrate your psychic powers again you've warmed up you're ready to go are you James very well Oh James you are prepared to pay him ten thousand dollars if he can turn the page of the telephone directory with certain controls that's right you have the ten thousand dollars do you rent it do indeed now what I have here is particles of a white plastic which when given a good tough good heavy puff of air will I think rather conclusively show whether or not blowing is a method accomplished now it will not perhaps in some way differentiate between genuine psychic power and actual blowing but it certainly should be very interesting indeed to see what now occurs James ready you that's my confidence on this diamond even how many cages just one page once like okay the styrofoam and the lights form electricity which pulls the page look it closed the page down instead of free in the pages alright and what would you like to ask us to ask Randy to allow you to do or for me to either take something else is a lighter or something that is going to keep that isn't going to formula aesthetic lectricity you mean put something else some other material around here that is not foam foam causes static electricity and the lights is what heats it up all right Randy is there anything else that you can put around the telephone direct I've heard the question but the question is not valid because it's making an assumption which is not true the foam does not in any way create static electricity and mr. Heydrich and demonstrating that the pages were clinging together didn't demonstrate it to my satisfaction I think we could perhaps ask the judges for their opinion on that I am not a scientist so I'm not qualified to declare on judges whatever static electricity exists and the styrofoam would not really affect the movement of the page or the cleaning of the pages together in my opinion I would I would add that if this is in fact psychic functioning I don't really see why that would make a difference very well Randy would you allow me to turn perhaps half dozen pages and then put them back oh yes can we do that please James I'll just lift up one to be helpful to you the static is going to still be here because of the foam well it is the opinion of the judges that there is not enough static form by the foam to be a problem so under the conditions agreed upon it would seem that now you should at least try with psychic power to turn the page of the telephone directory James okay it's not going to turn 4 you know it is well I have you reached the point them and at which we can declare the demonstration terminated this isn't a magician's trick I can't just come up Beibei and it's over I have to be to where I can work with something small and then big you know to build up my own self so they'll you know yeah trick it has to be done you know this is just this power it's it's mental power the conditions agreed upon have been fulfilled mm-hmm Bob the the comment very briefly is that I have gone through many hundreds of these tests with many hundreds of people who claim to have psychic powers and quite frankly it's more or less the same story every time when a simple direct very uncomplicated protocol is used and the control is applied the psychic forces don't seem to be present if indeed they are ever present at all five you've agreed to attempt to find a piece of zinc bar like this one right over here which is concealed under one of the seven boxes that you see behind us is that correct yes that's correct first please show us the effect of your dowsing rod on this sample of zinc ore and we'll just conceal the sample with a box so the conditions are exactly the same as when you come to do the test I know James now to explain how the what the rod works when you're facing the or I don't if you can see this but I'm glad it we put a white ended tip there it has a slight sideways move when you're there take it off and it dies you die comes in and it dies again so to amplify that I give it an a voluntary upward movement so aim it at the or and what do you get you get a large oval form which is easy to distinguish if I take it to the side it died I'll close my eyes bring it in I can feel it moving Ted well that seems to be a very dramatic demonstration now will you please try to locate the aura sample taken from the same piece of zinc ore which is hidden it one of the boxes behind us of course if chance alone were operating here you'd have a one in seven chance of finding the sample at your first attempt using guesswork alone we'd expect you to locate the zinc or sample by your third or fourth attempt good luck Clive thank you very much James Rhys I'll take number one first in the upward movement know that come back to them try four again just see well James well bang concepts even there on number seven all right let's take a look and see now even I don't know underneath which box these ink or is and I see that it's not here well plywood you like to have a second try attic let's try number four again number four no well it was wrong so let's try another attempt shall we Carla tried to try number two right let's take a look here we are at box number two the third guess and ah there we are there's the piece of thing st. goar pardon me well climbs uh are you join me here for a minute yes sir we said that by chance you'd find it on your third or fourth attempt you found it on the third attempt so your results sadly seem to be no better than chance but we'd like to thank you very much for coming tonight what we're concerned with tonight is whether or not it's possible for James to perceive an aura through obstacles and determine that we've agreed upon the following experiment would you step over here with me James we're now going to reveal to our audience here in the studio the five volunteers behind the screen now each one is standing beneath a letter a B C D and E now James can you see all the auras through this screen here yes you can I'm now going to ask someone at random to step from behind the screen I have the names here in my pocket first of all will John step around from behind the screen uh James can you still see his aura around his body yes and which position did John come from do you believe see from see John would you step into the position seed please James if as you claim you can see auras through the screen John should now be standing in the same position as he was when he was behind the screen is that correct yes now will Helen please come forward Allen will step out from behind the screen now Jane's from what position did Helen come he from D Helen will you step into position D please can I now ask Andrew to come forward please Andrew is the third person from behind the screen there he is and they're only three spaces left which one do you think he belongs in a in a Andrew would you take position a please now what Bob please step forward only two spaces left which letter B or e-e-e would you step into position E and finally what Danny step forward please of course there's no choice vote which letter James thinks you are so Danny you'll take up position B am I correct okay fine just a moment ago these five persons were standing behind the screen James if you have them all in the correct order it will be good evidence that you can see auras through screens as you have a less than 1% chance of matching all of these five correctly by chance alone just by guesswork by chance alone you should get the expectation is one of them correct if it's only chance let's see it James managed to beat the odds to these five people I asked please reveal which position you were originally standing in by showing us I think it's inside your hat isn't it take them off and let's see C B D a and E so out of this we obtained two correct all right so James you got two out of five correct and I take my hat off to you for trying would your volunteers please go back to the correct positions in which they actually belong take your correct positions and those three move into different spots the results are only slightly better than those predicted by chance it seems something what a bit wrong this time what explanation could there be James well that's quite possible if um this has been the first time that I've ever attempted this right mm-hmm and it's quite possible that um I've allowed myself to come into it okay I see but you did say you could see them throughout yes I can yeah well thank you very much James for coming tonight where's papa seem to have divine powers as is it Gould Alice Gould he knew their names stand up Alice as well as the afflictions they'd come to cure God is touching that thyroid condition right now God is touching your nerves right now God is touching your eyes just lift up your hands get ready here it comes he also knew the personal details of their lives your good news from Charles before everything is over I'll tell you he's going to be completely delivered because of your prayers because of your faith here it comes complete period Jesus mighty name right now right now right now amen it's all right to praise Allah I suspected that Popoff's revelations were other than divine radio scanner we brought to the hall picked up a decidedly worldly source hello PD can you hear me if you can't you're in trouble yeah is it papa was being prompted by his wife through a wireless earpiece John she'd gotten her information from prayer cars filled out by the faithful before the show began you want to get rid of this Walker sister Oh Lord how long have you been walking on that walk ma'am three years three years 16:27 tenth Street 16:27 tenth Street burning this off riotous right out of your body take a few steps just to make the devil mad hallelujah that's it just move around a little bit there she goes just walk with me Oh glory to God she's not gonna need that walker anymore guys just new strength new help burning that arthritis out bobak just keep going hallelujah I was able to arrange for another broadcast of the miracle crusade on The Tonight Show but this time the wireless prompting was included 1987 peter Popoff declared bankruptcy

 fascinated with Mars? There's this visceral
 connection that we have. It's been a constant
 steady light in the night sky for us. You and I can go outside
 tonight on a clear night, look towards the
 southwestern sky, and see a bright orange
 star, the Red Planet. (audience applauding) Looking at Mars,
 it's also of interest because it is within what
 we call the Habitable Zone around the sun. And so we're going to
 be exploring tonight a little bit more. I'd like to ask our
 guests here, our experts on a little bit about that. And let's get into
 the challenges and
 what it really takes to get to Mars. - Mars is incredibly
 difficult to get onto, because you have to go
 through the atmosphere. And the atmosphere
 is not your friend, because it swells
 up because of dust. When there's a lot of
 dust in the atmosphere, it shrinks. There are lateral winds,
 although the atmosphere is thin. But it is a scientific bonanza
 once you're on the surface. It has ancient rivers
 and ancient lakes, hydrothermal systems. All the evidence is there,
 the geologic evidence. It's from the first
 half of geologic time. So early in geologic time,
 Mars was warm and wet, and the international
 exploration of Mars robotically is all focused
 on if it was habitable and whether or not life
 got started and evolved and is still there. - That's amazing. So let's look at some
 of the technology. Let's talk about
 this character here. He's making a lot of
 buzz in the media, right? Elon Musk, he's
 the head of SpaceX, and his true love and
 passion is space exploration. And his vision is to
 send humans to Mars. So NASA isn't really alone. They have partnerships. Is that...
 - Right. - Yes, so NASA historically
 has partnered with people, has consulted and contracted
 with organizations all over the country. And so as we're looking
 into this next phase, this going to Mars, there
 are still going to have to be these partnerships. As you say, Elon Musk is one, but there are others
 that are going to help us do the important
 work of figuring out what, exactly, the
 best technology is. But it is definitely
 something that we're going to have to do together. - It's not an easy thing. - No. - Right, so take a look at this. Thousands of years from
 now, whatever we become, whoever we are, we'll
 look back at these next few decades as
 the moment in time that we are moving
 off this planet as a multi-planetary species. - And SpaceX stands
 as nothing less than a massive game changer. that I founded this company is
 to get human beings to Mars. - The key to making
 Mars economical is the reusability of rockets. - I just don't think
 there's any way to have a self-sustaining Mars
 space without reusability. Getting the cost down
 is really fundamental. If wooden sailing ships in the
 old days were not reusable, I don't think the United
 States would exist. - And if they nail this
 ability to land a rocket any way they want on
 Earth, then they can nail doing it on Mars. - This flight is a huge deal. We haven't yet
 landed the rocket. So this is going to
 be hopefully our first successful landing. six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. We have liftoff of Falcon 9. (spectators cheering
 and applauding) (dramatic music) Altitude 32 kilometers. Speed at one
 kilometer per second. Downrange distance
 13 kilometers. (explosive sounds) (slow dramatic music) between failure,
 risk and innovation, which is you can take risks. You can try something
 very innovative. But you're more likely to fail. - So what was it
 supposed to look like? Well, you'd have the
 booster going up, and what I'm showing
 you here is going to be a composite, a long
 exposure photograph. What it's supposed
 to have looked like, and then the booster
 coming back down. And what you see on your
 right hand side of the screen is the booster that came
 down back onto the launchpad. And what I want to know,
 Jedidah, is why is it so important to
 have reusability? I'm talking about
 Mars, going to Mars. Why is that so important? - Yeah, over the long
 term, the hope is that if you can reuse something,
 it's cheaper, right? You want it to be cheaper
 and more efficient. It's sort of your workhorse
 that you just continue to use. It's not always the case
 that things are cheaper when you reuse them,
 but you want something that you can use,
 rinse, recycle, reuse. That's rinse, repeat,
 that's what you want. The other thing is, you
 want to be able to use that piece of technology
 as scaffolding for the next thing you do. Maybe you use a piece
 of your booster to build the first structure, right? Maybe you recycle
 it in that way. So you hope, first, that
 there's a cost savings. You hope that there's
 a sort of efficiency that you can build in. And third, that you can
 use it as a scaffolding for the next thing. - Let's look at the
 idea of the timeline. What is it, like seven
 months to get there, right? Just to get there. So we need to, right now,
 start building up on that, and one of the most
 recent attempts at that is the year-long mission that
 both the U.S. and the Russians took part in. U.S. astronaut Scott Kelly,
 you can see here in this image, spent a whole year,
 coming back in March, exploring this whole
 concept of what happens to human body being exposed to microgravity
 for long durations? So we're starting to
 work on those aspects. And I'd like to know,
 I mean, what toll does it take on the human body? What does space travel,
 long term space travel, do to a human body? - The truth is we don't
 really know, right? We've never done this before. Commander Scott Kelly
 and his colleagues were sort of the
 first to stay in space as long as they did. And even there, they had
 a lot more protection from Earth, from the
 sort of microgravity. Also, we were still
 in the magnetosphere, so they had protection
 from radiation. Still, more radiation
 than they'd have if they were where we are, but we don't know
 what's going to happen when you put a person
 in sort of interstellar, interplanetary travel
 for seven months. We don't know. We know already that
 you lose bone mass. We know that you've got
 these radiation effects. We have no idea about
 the psychological impact. So these are all
 things that we're still trying to understand, and
 his mission, their mission is critical to understanding
 at least step one in the process. So there's a lot
 to be understood. - When we get there,
 I'd like to know how are we going to
 choose the landing sites? Now, what I've got here
 for you is the map of Mars, and these are potential
 landing sites that we have. What goes in, Ray, maybe
 you can speak to this, about choosing... - Well, there are
 engineering aspects. There are science aspects. You want to go to a place that's scientifically interesting. Could be layer
 deposits that represent kind of ancient
 riverbeds or lakes. It could be ancient hydrothermal
 deposits from volcanoes, or whatever it turns out to be. But you also need
 to land in a place that you can get back out of. And that's the plus or minus 50. It's relatively easy
 to go back into orbit. And not too cold, because Mars is
 cold to begin with. It's way below
 freezing on average. And if you go to
 the high latitudes, it's super cold. - You know, the ultimate
 goal is to send humans. So what I'd like to know
 is what do you guys think in terms of the specialties? What kind of people should
 we be sending to Mars? - It's an important
 point to recognize that going to Mars is going
 to be what they call sociotechnological. It is not just going
 to be the technical that takes us there. It's not just going
 to be the sociological or the psychological. It is going to be the
 interaction of those two things, the optimization of
 those two things, that makes it happen. So, yeah, you want
 people that have skills that are technical. You want them to be
 able to fix things and create experiments. Physicians, you need
 someone there in case you have medical emergencies. But you also want the
 kind of mental stamina to be able to deal with
 all of the conditions that you're going to
 be sort of faced with. So as I look at it, I think
 about not just your skills in terms of what you've
 been educated to do, I think of a variety
 of perspectives, of life experiences,
 of outlooks on life, because all of those things
 are going to be necessary to make this work. So we need an
 inclusive environment and an inclusive set of people. isn't it, Jedidah? - Yeah, so it's this idea
 of being able to reuse and create a sense of
 self-sufficiency, right? We cannot haul all the
 food we'll ever eat to Mars if we go, if we stay. All of these questions. You just can't bring it. You've got to create
 self-sufficiency and food security there. So the idea is that you'll
 want to figure out ways to grow things on Mars. And not just for food, which
 is going to be important, but again towards
 that social component. You'll want something to
 do that brings you closer to nature. We've seen Mars
 is an arid place. There's not much happening
 there, as we can see so far. So you want some green. You'll want to get
 your hands in the dirt. You'll want to grow something, see it progress over time. So there's that mental
 sort of restorative piece of going and being out
 in nature, even on Mars. - I mean, that's interesting, but when we're talking
 about going to Mars, to me this looks
 like a candy wrapper. I don't know, but
 there's trash on Mars right now already.
 - Already. - Right? There's trash. I mean, we're already... - What can you do? I mean, it's probably a
 piece of the sky crane. - Right, but we're
 not living there. Humans aren't there yet. We're sending our stuff there. And then we're already
 altering Mars, right? There's already
 alterations of Mars, and there's talk about how
 humans will be altered by Mars as well. There's a lot of
 talk about that. And I want you guys to
 check this little video out. This whole idea of
 altering Mars and stuff. It's really fascinating. - Terraforming Mars
 is not a small job. This is a massive project. This is a bigger project
 than anything humanity has ever attempted. - Terraforming is
 taking an environment such as Mars and making
 it more Earthlike. - Terraforming is like super
 science fictiony right now. I don't think people
 understand how big planets are, so terraforming one
 is a ludicrous task. - You solve all the
 problems except breathing. So once Mars is terraformed
 and made more Earthlike, you're still going to have
 to wear a helmet on your head of some sort or some kind
 of breathing apparatus. - Might we have the urge
 to tinker with our DNA, such that you don't need
 a spacesuit on Mars? - We are on the edge
 right now of being able to change our own genome
 and our own genetics in our own bodies in real time. - Our ability to control
 DNA, the programming language of life, helps us open up Mars. What happens if there
 is a virus that drives some kind of a flu and
 knocks out a large population or large percentage
 of your group? You can actually
 sequence the virus, send it back to
 Earth to analyze, and you can send back from Earth an upgraded T-cell. - If you do interfere
 with our genome so that you can survive on Mars, you're pretty much going
 through a one-way door and saying, I will
 never go back to Earth. - We might very well
 have a future in which you have different
 kinds of humans that look very different
 from each other. - Once we get computers
 that are smarter than humans at thinking about stuff
 and coming up with stuff, we can ask them to figure
 out how to cure viruses. - We can kind of tell them,
 look, we want to explore, and this is what
 we'd like to do. And then the robots, either
 the rovers or the helicopters or the balloons can
 make their own judgement and actually do the exploration. - So ultimately we're
 going to need things like machines that can make
 machines if we want to have a solar system civilization. - Well, future technologies
 that we're developing on Earth now, like 3D
 printing and electric cars, can actually be
 extremely useful to us in creating an outpost
 of civilization on Mars. - Imagine being able
 to send a 3D printer to the Martian surface that
 sort of pulls the soil out, adds some water, adds some
 binder, and is sitting there 3D printing shelters in
 advance of a community coming. And you've got your
 homes pre-built waiting for you right there. - So Jedidah, this is all nice, but what happens if
 we find life on Mars? Will our plans be altered? - I think they should be, right? Because now we've got to
 understand and figure out what's happening, try not
 to completely decimate their way of being and
 life in terms of, probably, microbial structures and such. Also just small tidbit,
 no terraforming. - No terraforming. Interesting. Why is that? - It's a stupid idea. - Okay. Why? - It's out of equilibrium. I mean, Mars is cold and
 dry today for a reason. Early in geologic time,
 there were volcanoes. There was a massive amount
 of greenhouse warming from the gases coming up. Because it's small a
 planet relative to Earth, it stopped its internal
 activity sooner than the Earth. So the gases in the atmosphere
 were on a one-way trip to be oxidized and
 placed into minerals. So if you increase the amount
 of sunlight with mirrors, or whatever, you can
 sublimate, get more water vapor in the atmosphere, more rain. But what's going to happen? It's going to react
 with the rocks and go back down into the
 subsurface eventually. There's a famous reaction
 that was codified by Harold Urey. He's a very distinguished
 Nobel Prize winning chemist. And it's the way the
 Earth stays more or less the way we like it. Sometimes it goes
 into deep freeze. Sometimes it's really warm. But what happens is, is the
 volcanoes pump up the gases that keep us warm. But the hydrologic cycle
 consumes those gases, as carbonic acids,
 CO2 goes into the water, and it reacts and
 forms limestones. But the limestones
 go back downstairs, get decomposed, and
 the gases come back up as greenhouse gases
 through volcanoes. If you stop the internal engine, you go in the
 one-way deep freeze. It's what happened to Mars, because it's smaller
 than the Earth. So terraforming can
 increase the temperature of the surface, but you
 can get some gas out. But it will eventually
 get corroded and put back down
 into the subsurface in a one-way trip. So it may work for
 a couple decades, but over longer
 time, it's bogus, in my opinion. - And also would decimate
 whatever is there that we don't know yet. - Yeah, there's a very
 important paradigm that all the nations
 are following called Planetary Protection. So you sterilize spacecraft
 before they're on the surface, because the worst thing
 to have happen is to go to Mars in the future
 and find ourselves. - All right, I have a question. One last question. If you could take

  you think they do is because
 of bad science
 and worse marketing. Heh!
 That's ridiculous. When I eat fat, it goes
 in my body and becomes fat, and fat is bad.    Yeah, that's what
    everybody thinks,   but it's not true.   Oh, hey, an egg timer!    (timer tingling) (blows)
 People have been eating fat for as long
 as humans have existed, and their lives
 were swell.    (whoosh) Fat tastes good! Also, salve
 for tiger wound. Okay, maybe not swell.    The point is, fat
  is one of our oldest and most basic nutrients.  Wow, thank you
  for the history
   lesson, Adam.  But I need
  to lose weight,   and the most
   important thing is
   for me to cut out fat. Yep, that's what
 the sugar industry
 wants you to think.    (whoosh)    ♪♪ (upbeat jazz playing) Holy, hambone! Are you trying to
 give me a heart attack? Funny you should
 say that, because in the early
 20th century,  doctors began to notice
  a disturbing rise in a once rare condition
 called heart disease.    Americans' hearts
  are failing. But where will
  the love go? And when
 President Eisenhower  suffered a heart attack
  in 1955,    it galvanized
    the nation.   Mmm, mmm-- (gasps) Someone look into this!  Uhh! Americans were
 determined to
 fight heart disease,    but instead,
    they were bamboozled
    by the sugar industry   and one very suave
   scientist.    (whoosh)  This is Ancel Keys,
  a scientist so popular,   he once made the cover
   of ""Time"" magazine.   (camera shutters clicking,
    people cheering) (wolf whistle) Keys was certain
 that fat    was the cause
    of heart disease,    but only because
    he cherry-picked his data    to get the result
    he wanted. This data's out of sight!
 This data can sit on it! Fat makes you fat.
 Ehh! (people laugh and hoot) And nobody cared that
 his research was bad?  Not really.  Except for one slightly
  less popular scientist   named John Yudkin. Actually, sugar
 is the likely culprit. When you eat more sugar
   than your liver can
    normally process,   it's stored as fat. Hey, get a load
 of the nerd!   (laughter)    Keys denounced Yudkin  and made fun of his
  research in public.   (Yudkin stammering)   Fat makes you fat.  End of story!    (people cheering) And people
 just believed this jerk?  Yeah, because
  of a big assist   from a group with
   a sickly sweet agenda,  the sugar industry.   (pop music playing) In the '60s, these
 candy-coated capitalists started straight up
 paying scientists to downplay
 the dangers of sugar and shift
 the blame to fat.    Here's a little something
    for that big   ""fat problem"" we have. You got it, sugar. (music stops) I mean, ""you""
 the sugar industry. I wasn't
 calling you ""sugar.""   When John Yudkin spoke out against sugar in 1972,  the industry
  publicly mocked him,  calling his research
   ""science fiction."" Now, now, we've been
 eating fat for millennia,    but if we track the rise  in sugar consumption,   there's a clear correlation
  with the rise    in heart disease  and obesity. (laughing)
 If we track the rise
 of sugar consumption! Live long and prosper!
 Beep beep! I am a sugar robot!   (laughter) I am not a sugar robot.    I'm not!    The sad truth is,
    Yudkin was right. We now know that sugar    is linked  to both heart disease
 and weight gain    and has been found to be
  more addictive than cocaine. But Keyes
 and sugar industry  spent so many years
 swaying the research that by the time
 that Yudkin retired,
 the public was convinced. Despite being right
 the whole time, he died in obscurity.  (wind blows)    Wow. Science is
    a harsh business. And Big Sweet's relentless
 lobbying didn't stop there. They spent years
 packing health panels with sugar-friendly
 scientists.   We need reliable,
   objective research! I've got just the man.  (drum roll)    (playing whistle)
    Fat's bad. Their campaign reached
    its sugar height  when the USDA
 officially recommended a low-fat diet in 1980. (""Star Spangled Banner"" plays) Fat is the enemy!   (laughter)    This lead to a full-blown craze for low-fat food everyone started
 getting thinner. Right?  Quite the opposite.    After the USDA
    came out against fat,    obesity rates
    actually skyrocketed. (laughing)
  But why?! Low-fat foods must help me
 lose weight. I mean, I'm cutting out
 something, right?  Wrong.   When you take the fat out,
   it makes food taste worse,  so to make it
  more palatable, food companies typically
 a little something--    piles and piles of sugar. Oh! This fat-free cake
  tastes like Styrofoam, y'all. Let's just add
 a little sugar.   And... much better.    (giggles)  Now, let's talk about why I think white sugar
 is superior to brown-- Okay, that's enough!
 Oh, yikes. But you said
 that sugar makes
 you gain weight. Exactly. The sugar industry
 peddled bad science and demonized fat
 in order to sell us
 more of the product that actually causes
 heart disease and weight gain. And now, eating
 so much sugar has made us fatter
 and unhealthier.   Et tu, Snacky?"

 obvious. We have to go to Mars. You might’ve heard a lot of people talking
 about this recently — from tech innovators to NASA scientists, even President Obama has
 made the case that we should go to Mars. So we talked to Chris McKay, a senior scientist
 at NASA's Ames research center. He's involved in the planning of future Mars
 missions, and he walked us through some of the hazards. I'm Brian Resnick, I'm a science reporter
 at Vox. I will never go to Mars, and here the top
 seven reasons why. Here's number one. Your rocket could blow up before leaving Earth. This is pretty obvious. NASA has a pretty good track record with sending
 astronauts to space, but we also know that there have been tragedies. For some context, the NASA space shuttle program
 carried 833 people to orbit between 1981 and 2011, of which fourteen people died in
 two big explosions. SpaceX has a checkered history of trying to
 launch rockets and land them. Number two: So if you successfully leave Earth and it's all safe, and it's all good, there are
 still some dangers in that journey to Mars. The biggest danger here is radiation exposure. The vacuum of space is not really empty. There's radiation emanating from the sun,
 and it goes out in all directions. There are gamma rays, and X rays, and ultraviolet
 light, and all these things that can damage our cells. Here on Earth, we have a dense atmosphere
 and a magnetic field that helps keep this radiation out of our daily lives. According to measurements from NASA’s Curiosity
 rover, there’s more radiation on the surface of Mars than there would be on Earth. Perhaps the more worrisome risk of radiation
 in space is from solar flares. Occasionally and randomly and in a way that's
 hard to predict, the sun emits very large batches of radiation in great flares. Number three: you can crash on Mars' surface
 trying to land. One thing about landing on Mars that the atmosphere
 is a lot thinner. That means there's a lot less of a cushion
 — another way to think about it is there's a lot less friction in the atmosphere that
 will naturally slow your spacecraft down. You would need a system of rockets to help
 you land smoothly on Mars. We saw with the Curiosity rover, that was an incredibly intricate and choreographed
 maneuver to get just that one-ton rover down onto the planet. Could you imagine getting
 6, 7, 10, a hundred humans down onto that planet? You would need a very complicated, very sophisticated,
 and very well-tested system to help people descend down to the Martian surface. Number four: Mars’ low gravity might wreak
 havoc on your bones and muscles. Many astronauts who spend six months or more on the Space Station have vision loss that doesn't get corrected when they come back down to the Earth. There was one astronaut that went from perfect
 20/20 vision to 20/100 vision just in six months. Other things that happen in the microgravity
 of space is that your muscles start to deteriorate, your bones start to deteriorate, and this
 can be staved off by some regular exercise, but NASA really hasn't found a complete solution
 to this problem. Think about a six-month voyage to Mars. You know once you get there, the Martian gravity
 isn't as strong as Earth's. It's not as light as you would be on the moon,
 it’s not as heavy as you would be on Earth. So will muscles and bones and eyesight continue
 to deteriorate on Mars is not yet known. Number five: your space suit or habitat could
 leak, and you just can't breathe Martian air. The pressure of Mars’ atmosphere is just
 a fraction of the pressure of the earth's atmosphere. Your house on Mars would be like the cabin
 of an airplane: Any crack in your house any slit in your space
 suit will lead it to depressurize … and that's an obvious problem. Mars is filled with dust and dirt
 that just gets everywhere — it could quickly clog all of your intake vents, it
 could quickly destroy some of your electronics, and people could die if you inhale it. So the dream is that one day we could potentially
 breathe Martian air. This is an idea that has long obsessed science
 fiction authors: it's called terraforming. And the idea is that maybe we can change the
 Martian atmosphere to be more like Earth. We could start some global warming on Mars,
 and raise the temperature of the planet, and entrap more greenhouse gases in. We
 can raise the level of CO2 so we can start growing plants there, those plants could then
 start to produce oxygen. This is probably the most far-fetched idea
 out there — not to say it's impossible, but just, it is well, well into the future. Number six: the planet Mars could literally kill you. The soil of Mars is toxic. You might have seen the movie The Martian,
 where astronaut Mark Watney grows potatoes on Mars in the Martian soil. We probably shouldn't do that. It contains a very high concentrations of
 chemicals called perchlorates. These are salts that can do serious damage
 to the human body, especially the thyroid. You wouldn’t want to grow your potatoes
 in it. It's okay to get Martian dirt on your hands
 but you really wouldn't want to get into your drinking water or food or get into your habitat. Number seven: your fellow travelers could
 drive you crazy. This is been a surprising challenge for NASA to learn and to get over: how do you craft a crew for a spaceship that will be
 alone with each other for months on end, and also be the only human beings on an entire
 planet for perhaps months or years, and spending
 only their time with one another? If there's going to be a mutiny, or if there's going to be interpersonal strife on Mars, that is an element that could be the riskiest of all. There was this project called Biosphere 2
 in 1994. ""Living in it was supposed to be like living
 in a space colony."" It was a seven-person crew, and they split up into warring factions and the mission
 had to end prematurely. So it will take some calibration to find
 who are the right people for this type of mission. The first people who go to Mars should go with the expectation that they might never
 come back. But that hasn't stopped explorers for centuries:
 There's always gonna be a drive in humans to go places we've never been before. And for the most part, that drive is something
 that has aided our survival at times. So will the risks on a trip to Mars be great? Absolutely. Should we go? Absolutely."

done something fellas that most of you have never done all of you carrot players have not done what I've done some of you former players are not old enough to have done what I've done I have seen all 52 Super Bowls I've seen every last one I'm 62 years old I know you can't tell I know I know if you're looking here caught for the swag on you dripping so cold I've seen all the Super Bowls I watched everybody all of us are in here tonight because of one person Tom Brady if Tom Brady wasn't living y'all could be in a Super Bowl the only way I see us getting in the Super Bowl and I don't know why you ain't thought of it all this money in this room y'all II thought of pooling y'all money together having him killed that tighten y'all up a little bit you ain't thought about it hell I have I'm tired of Tom Brady in Super Bowl every day I'm Gil if he wasn't here we could be in the Superbowl other Super Bowl stars are here last time I saw a championship game I'm from Cleveland Jim Brown was in the championship game 1964 I saw that game when I got it sitting on the float watching me that's the last time we had a championship in please Wayne you seen nothing sense and this is black history so let's have a little black history moment shout out to all the quarterbacks that started in the NFL five quarterbacks that were African American descent started in the playoffs I just found out it was five I thought it was folk - Patrick Mahone took his helmet off let me give you a little history 1993 african-american quarterback named Charlie Ward received the highest award in college football the best college football player he played quarterback for Florida State he won the Heisman Trophy where did he go after that the New York Knicks cause Dayton draft black quarterbacks back there but now they do and that right there is black history it ain't funny what is black history one thing we want to talk to you all about our celebrations I like celebrations I like touchdown celebrations what I don't like is unworthy celebrations the NBA got away if you see if you dunk and ain't nobody on you but you dunk and you lay your six nine you got an 8 foot wingspan so what you done yes only had to jump six inches that don't call for that here's the thing or what y'all doing I'm okay with the touchdown celebrations what I'm not okay with is the first down celebration it's the smallest accomplishment in football it's just ten yards that's here to the microphone now you make a first down now you spit in the football now we gotta wait till the damn ball stop spinning your it's ten yards get your punk ass down there to the end zone last thing I am a die-hard Cleveland Browns fan I was raised in Cleveland Ohio it's been hard Lord Jesus knows it's been hard two years in a row one win but this year something happened we got this wide receiver named Jarvis Landry this boy came up right in front of Jim Brown Jarvis Landry came and change an attitude Mitchell started running that thing for the Cleveland Browns is in y'all's back right now we are on our way but the big reason is that damn Baker may seal that's my man right there I love a great field I like the fact that he he dance he got attitude got swagger and he got two black names Baker Mayfield that's neither Baker's nephew and Curtis Mayfield pale colors think of me I have a problem right now because I'm thirsty my mouth so dry right now I'm wearing this well I'm trying to locate spit right now you don't hey my wife you see me don't you oh you got anything for me any lip gloss what I need oh there is something I

racial these is my lips I've had these lips my entire life this ain't nothing new they were the same science when I was 8 so I'm not really trippin we are here to have a good time tonight I just want

it surprised me to see JJ Watt on this list it really did I was surprised and delighted that what made the list JJ Watt I love that you guys have him on this list so rare to have a defensive lineman on a list like this it's usually offensive skill guys Jiji watch is able to snag the ball out of the air JJ Watts got to be on this list I mean 2014 alone I think does it for him 20 and a half sacks 50 quarterback hurries he was catching touchdowns JJ Watt he makes the catch Buffalo driving into Texans territory watt picks off EJ Manuel and runs it basically coast to coast for a touchdown Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts got it gotta be kidding me they could give the MVP trophy out right now there is no way in the history of anything that a guy named JJ Watt wasn't gonna be awesome he always looks like he's in an ad of some kind and it's a great ad he looks like a television character he's highlight reels might be better with just his working out videos I mean the hard-knock stuff with him throwing tires catching footballs with one hand he's an amazing player to watch now my favorite part about JJ Watt his ability to block passes his knack for blocking passes I've never seen a defensive player like that JJ Watt should not be on this list the fact that he does amazing things he's really fast he's a phenomenal athlete but we've really only seen five years out of him my body is taking a beating today I think a lot of people aren't able to really appreciate the highlights that JJ Watt has produced if you don't really understand line play play after play if you just watch wat to me they're they're almost all highlights that you can see a guy just totally better than the guys in front of them I've never seen it depends a player like that not working so well right now I like drew I don't like hitting like that it takes us a freak to stand out on defense he is the focal point of any Texans game no matter what happened what more can he do he's must-see TV which-which for a deal I admit I mean that's you know you never see that to put up a kind of reel he has had from that particular position is unthinkable it's never really happened in this league before and that's why he's here michael vick nah Wow how is michael vick number nine in hollywood michael vick is the definition of human highlight reel michael vick should be hired just because even nike had a whole campaign built around that you're gonna play in the michael vick body as a video game that's not in the playbook we're serving every single person who ever played mad in that year made sure they played with the Falcons by the way the stuff you could do within the madden he could do in real life he was the most crazy weapon at quarterback the NFL has ever seen stop on a dime cutback he was he was a super football he was blowing by quarterbacks who's 40 times were record-breaking homeboy and Vic made them look like they were standstill however not wanting to see him throw the ball I don't care I don't care you do it just run when Vic did throw his arms back was just as impressive what on oh my god control football easy easy 70 yards I think Michael Vick has three or four plays that I would put up against any player in NFL history as far as sheer highlights like unbelievable Falcons verse Vikings and when he rein it in over Tom's win the game keeping the football - Vikings defenders collide you know Mike vid was the man there's a an 80-yard passengers with the Eagle to the Sean Jackson that was just insane eighty yards in the air Michael Vick had some of the most amazing plays in NFL history I'd say if there's a top ten greatest players of all time Vick might be three of them if that's the case he might be number one of my highlight one of the most excited football players I've ever seen in my life he would have played a whole career he would be way higher but I think then we're not as fair for how long he was in the veil Devin Hester was my prayer Devin Hester he was so dangerous Devin has to made special teams awesome Devin has to return to all the things except for library books no player on our list gave us a better return on our viewing investment than Devin Hester no I appreciate by Devin Astor he did one thing great he knew his lane and rode it out for all of his career to the 10 to the 15 right get to unfortunate the sir anytime devin hester was returning the ball you made sure not to go to the fridge or change the channel you are watching Devin Hester every time he caught the ball there was me there was at least a 50% chance he felt that he was getting in the end zone it didn't matter that you'd seen him do it before every time he would catch a pun he would start with like no no start exactly don't go backwards definitely and then you'd be like yes go my favorite part of every devin hester punt return is that moment where the owner realizes that he has to look like an idiot momentarily and try to tackle a guy running directly at him at 30 miles an hour Hester is on the list because he changed the way we view the start of a Super Bowl he does what no one's ever done before four cents starts off a Super Bowl by running it all the way back this is the definition of a highlight that first minute this had to be a voice and Tony Dungy said like what did I tell you what did I tell you don't kick it to Devin Hester even watching himself on the jumbotron as he drops in Devin answers a human highlight reel until he had to do a rout punt returner and kick returner wide receiver big disappointment that shows what a badass returner he was that he was that good that all he had to do was return and make the list he is a lock for this list maybe not number one but you can't you worry no point doing this without him 14 books still waiting for devin hester to return so Devin I'm sorry about Harry Potter he's doing well if we're talking about top 10 train wrecks in NFL history I love me some me oh I think Terrell Owens is on the list if you're talking about highlight reels I think you put someone else there thanks say what everyone say about me I can't be stopped Terrell Owens is a human highlight reel at all hours as human highlights go there is only one tio tio got to be on your list as the most personal unit he gonna be top receiver Terrell Owens with his size and strength there was no way you were going to stop him he's going for over to the end zone top trash double selection everything not only did you have to watch him when he was running to the end zone you then had to watch him in the end zone because that sometimes was more exciting how number 7 human highlight didn't have an off switch popcorn digit popcorn a Sharpie celebration grab the cheerleaders pom-poms one time he did not just take the pom-poms and start spearing he really knew how to entertain a football it was always about Owens he had to be the highlight reel I just thought he was such a pain in the ass such a drama queen and then in the locker room after he'd lose a big game he'd start bawling about his quarterback it's party it's my fourth pick he went on his front yard and held a press conference while doing sit-up hey hey you can talk all the trash all you want and but as long as you have the abilities to match you're great I would watch Terrell Owens do literally anything anything I want to see them order food at a restaurant I want to see him workout at the gym I would watch Terrell Owens do literally anything that's why is on this list there has been and may only ever be one Grunk there aren't that many NFL players who are known by just one name like Madonna freakshow brothers hellos big dumb Squarehead he's the most exciting ever yeah but hey man no human being has ever better been made for football than Gronk Rob Gronkowski is hard to miss on a football field and he's even harder to cover he was just like this big lumbering animal that the defense no chance to stop this is your modern-day freak it's unstoppable he looks like a bulldozer doing ballet Cosby reaches down it makes a tumble in Kent he's so light on his feet and so heavy on his feet at the same time Spitz waiting for the better stiff arms another run into the tent leaps to the end zone tell me his team right now can stop on 187 tackle and then kicks it into this third gear they both try and undercut up at the goal line and the big boy takes it in I just like five people he looks like the high school senior that's playing with the sixth graders well after the touchdown signal was called drives them right off the field and into the television truck no matter what it's a tight end he's still blocking 60% of the time it's a boring position you can call Gronk a tight end but you can't call imploring any other 260 pound players do you see making fingertip catches with defensive players bouncing off them like they're crash-test dummies to be break I suspect a lot of drunks best highlights can't be shown on television one more I got six and nine touchdowns you know what I mean you can say anything and you're like we gotta go that we're not allowed to talk about celebrations kind of want to talk about it but I kind of don't because I'm in trouble so I don't know what to do you know oh my god it's so cute only you know what I mean baby the man is on field and off field football goal the name is made for the highlight reel the players made for the highlight reel I think it just all comes together and makes sense LT mama Stella deserves be on the list he was single-handedly changing game he changed the expectations of what it was to be a player in his position I mean of course he's on this list absolute monster I don't want to say anything funny about LT at all he's too intense he's too relentless those are like the only thing that I can think of when watching LT play Lawrence Taylor highlights make you thank the Lord in heaven that you don't play football can you imagine in coming at you I would be like okay it's over this was a nice life time to die watch his highlights and he like flinch what do you watch it just because of the sheer intensity at which he plays football I know it's a child when he's on the sidelines talking about going out like a bunch of crazed dog I was mortified of Lawrence Taylor as a child he's so good it's crazy tonight Lawrence Taylor's got that twattle open at about his hits are more mesmerizing more enchanting you can sit there and watch it over and over again but one of my favorite LT types of tackles is when he gets a one handed short tackle just grabs a guy by his Jersey and spins him around and like pretty much throws him like a bag of garbage into the end zone I sit back I marvel at the closing speed the ferocity be no chance that a tackle is gonna block him much less a tight end Lawrence Taylor was a one-man machine he was his own army actually is a probably a better way to phrase it it's guys leave whatever he wanted and he got up and he laughed at you he literally famously said to a quarterback after he tagged him he's like you're gonna have to do better than that bro after he did what he told you he was gonna do he then looked you in the eyes and said not only did I just do what I said I'm gonna do but I'm gonna do it again on the next 1982 Thanksgiving against Detroit he has three forced fumbles and to pick six in the second half Elte truly did beat the Detroit Lions by himself when you saw you were like he's a different tier of human than the other people playing Randy Moss is highlights are incredible to watch highlight rule after highlight really just fast quick screen bomb did you carry saris I don't know if you did kick returns to meet a human highlight reel is when you become known for a thing like to me when I think of Randy Moss I think of one handy catches stepping right there oh oh just caught a ball with my fingers he became a bird you got most if we're playing one-on-one right now and I caught the ball one-handed I lost you you were lost that's how you know you're in the holiday room if you're watching a game and you saw Randy put the hand up you know I'm open you knew he was open you knew he was getting the ball and that was it it was over that team all went to rainy months he may Randall Cunningham looked like he had a second career grandma's made daunte culpepper look like he was good Tom Brady had a Randy Moss caliber Flair he broke everywhere touchdown fast number 55 NFL record that season with the Patriots when Randy Moss breaks the record for Randy Moss touchdown reception number 23 unstoppable what time are you give me Randy Muslims prom give me Mouse let me throw it up high to limit your mom's I said all number three way too low he's maybe the most electric player in the history of football he starts the high step with the 25 Deion Sanders dancing Dion has to be number one because he is the human highlight reel when your nickname is neon you must act like a noble gas when your entire outer valence is filled with electrons you can't bond with anything you're not ionic or covalent no you're just scoring and playing defense as well and wearing a bandana he had a confidence in the swag and aura about him that says when I step on this field this is my domain Deion Sanders was born to be a highlight reel from the first time he stepped on the field Oh your first time touching the ball in the NF field you dropped the kick return and he take it to the house that tells you always me throw my literacy of great sleep I found the end zone six different ways you return the kick return the punt return interception he did it again a fumble an end-around or reversed here's a reverse to be on Sanders power versus direction mines a blocker and his 2010 is a right to the 10 to the 5 and he caught a touchdown best I don't thing he didn't do let's throw a touchdown pass and he probably could have him use a pro baseball player he made playing defensive back fun he made it exciting when you talk about San Francisco against the Falcons after the big fight on field rising and then what happens pick six and then when we get to the sidelines we're running up the field what are we doing we're looking at the whole team if I pass and look at me baby come right back and then we get in the end zone and we got to do what we got to do the dance that's my man you're showing off for me the person at home the person who you're entertaining I love that and the d on shuffle followers Deion Sanders is a highlight reel as a person yes--we when we didn't even know what it was primetime coming to Atlanta huh kind of transcended football in a way that he brought a lot of the people from a lot of the arenas and to watch football Deion Sanders fan close bit about the fan I remember growing up in there reason I watched football was because of the other solely because of Deion Sanders he's a la vaca correct considered by most experts is the greatest pullback ever to play the game Jimmy's harder to bring down than a wild steer right aback see I don't even know what you do it I just know his Jim Brown Jim Brown is so good that none of us have seen a highlight and we just know it's true this is what makes the highlights even better the imagination of what they would have been most dominant player to ever step on any athletic field faster than a speeding bullet to leap tall buildings in a single bound the pro game in the pop age had a number of superstars but only one Superman and he was Jim Brown I could watch Jim Brown highlight reels all day in the late 50s into the 60s Jim Brown was making highlights that continue to astound to this day almost in the last track four five six seven guys they can't physically bring him down there's a great highlight of two Brown throwing a perfect touchdown pass Brown arches the ball to Gary Collins for a touchdown you can just picture the quarterback off-screen looking at him like you're better at this than me too when I think about Jim Brown you know I think about a guy who dominated the sport but I don't know if if I saw those plays that made me just really go WOW could anybody else have done them I don't know how that's controversial Jim Brown would have broken the internet Jim Brown would have broken YouTube but he dominated a decade of football it was a different era football but you can tell on his highlights he would have dominated any era of ball because he could do anything with the ball in his hands Jim Brown for who he was and for what he did for the league I think it number two is very appropriate for him that makes sense he's number two Jim Brown could be number two boys you have to give it up for Barry Sanders I mean he's the best ever yeah he should be he was amazing of all my complaining about this list number one definitive no question absolutely Barry Sanders was not more exciting than Deion Sanders Barry Sanders highlight reels are out of this world Barry Sanders is number one because let's face it his highlights are the best if you did a highlight reel all the people that he duped roped ankles as different moves the way he pivot man I think Barry Sanders will be fun to watch does he move differently the reversing field REE reverse infield rear Erie reversing field everything that you teach about the position he just kind of crinkled up and threw out Barry Sanders runs like my wife argues wait you're here no you're here here Oh how'd you get over there Oh what happened I thought we were how many times we've seen Barry Sanders shake a guy out of his socks out of his underwear all of these defenders look like children trying to tackle this guy start with juking out one of the best safeties in NFL history John Lynch mano-a-mano just embarrasses no against Chicago Bears he's got three guys on him and in a total bear hug I mean it's almost like he psyched him out they thought they had him down and next thing you know he's gone that play against the Patriots were he just doing this Harlen barnett new england patriots for him just to get put in the spin cycle turned about 18 different directions barry sanders just embarrassed him Sanders moves were so good he was invisible to defenders right in front of it we couldn't believe that he was making these moves and making these NFL players look as bad as he did good job the very left side all 35 40 he really was the definition of old school football he was a classy dude that just played the game and let his actions do the talking that's the thing it's amazing when you take a team that you still show their highlights even though they've lost because they have one of the most electric elusive players to ever put on a uniform that's what a highlight reel is don't lose the best in the business I don't know how you put anybody ahead of Barry Sanders in terms of just pure highlights and this district tacular moves that he made on the football field listen man I'm protesting this list I'm protesting this list that's a problem I think he did the right thing I know we've only done this like 8000 times how was Devin Hester ahead of Michael Vick dog he did was return kickoffs they're kind of weird for nothing man I put him at 10 did I bump JJ wad off altogether Deon has to be number one because he is the human highlight reel ahead of Michael Vick seven is worth every dime no Deion's number boy yeah I think Randy would disagree so the mama top three Barry Sanders Brown moss just change the list no biggie

Thank you, thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. Okay, now when we first started making my TV series in '89, we made the first episode—
 it was basically me, George, and Kramer. George was kind of a Larry David
 character, Larry had a funny neighbor named Kramer so we threw him in. We used as little imagination as possible. All Larry and I really wanted to do was
 have two guys talk in an idiotic way about completely stupid things, which is
 not nothing. We did not want it to be about nothing, we wanted it to be about
 being stupid. Okay, so we make the first episode, and I don't think anybody liked it
 that much. They eventually said, ""okay, you can make a few more but you need a real female character. All you've got is three stupid
 guys."" Now, in the TV network world of those days when the network executives
 say, ""we have an idea to make your show better,"" it is always, without fail, without
 exception, the worst idea you have ever heard, which is not their fault. It's not
 their job to have funny ideas. It would be like if a geologist sent me out into
 the desert to find the mineral bauxite. I could never find it. I don't know what
 bauxite is—I'm not a geologist. Even if I found it I would not know that I had found it. I can't tell one rock from another. This
 is why most TV sitcoms are not funny— bauxite: if you're not a geologist, don't
 go looking for it. Anyway, when the network tells you what they think you
 should do, it is called a ""network note."" ""The network has a note"" is what they say,
 and in this case we thought, ""okay, that's not a bad idea. We should have a real
 woman character in the show. We've got three stupid guys, let's add a smart
 woman, that's funny. My point is, this person you see over here, Julia, how you
 doing sweetie, you okay? It's only a couple more hours. This person, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who
 agreed to do this part with three stupid guys and used it to launch one of the
 most brilliant and spectacular show business careers of all time, this person
 is a ""network note."" That's what you're looking at. That is a humble beginning, which is also
 not nothing. Okay, so then we fleshed the idea out a
 little more, we decided, okay, let's make it a girl that Jerry used to date, it
 didn't work out, but was so much fun to hang out with, they decided to continue
 the relationship as friends. A completely absurd idea, could never happen in real
 life...it's a TV sitcom, it's good enough. Okay, so, now as lame-o as all this is, I
 was still required as an actor to play this situation—that she and I were a
 couple, we broke up, there was this other aspect to our relationship that enabled it
 to survive but without the romantic element, you know, there's some layers and
 complexity to that and, candidly speaking, way, way beyond any acting ability that I
 possess. So, how did I do it? Because obviously I did it. 
 People bought it; they believed it. They believed the relationship and I think it's fair to say 
 the show went on to do very nicely. Here is how I did it: 
 I just really, really like Julia. I could not get enough of her. Nine years...I was not acting. I
 couldn't! I thought she was funny, charming, beautiful, intelligent, every
 single second I ever spent with her, on stage and off, bingo, no acting required,
 just read the lines in the script, 180 episodes, syndication, DVD, 
 streaming, piece of cake. (applause) Now, after the show was over and I
 started seeing her on other shows having relationships with other TV characters, I
 can't say that was the easiest thing for me to handle. I suffered quite a bit of fake pain from this fake relationship. But, I guess
 somewhere in the back of my mind I knew that these are the things that were
 required of her to do if she was ever going to receive the Mark Twain Prize, so
 I accepted it and I couldn't be happier for her that tonight she is here
 accepting this great honor. Congratulations, Jules, love you."

David Letterman I've never been so damn thank you let me just check something Vivi the line was just a potty sitting minute Sheila we got it you can't beat wacky probs yeah ya know we go we go with the goods and by the way I appreciate the shot in the monologue that did a world for my morale you know just pack up and get in the car now oh yeah I picked up that gentle humor for watching you heathen giveth he that giveth must also take it you've been saving that joke since the coup you got it yeah yes on the off chance you might show up here yeah now let me before we continue we'll get to your questions in a shirt oh sure no problem and I have something can I have a word with the band certainly excuse me guys yeah the gravy train is being discontinued they actually will have to get that's right anyway I came over here early I'm terribly nervous about the appearance when I say to myself Dave I say to myself Dave let's go get us a beverage so I go to this place down the street they're down Alameda and it's one of these places sells a lot of muffins in fact it says mostly muffins but no that's not the name of the place and and I go in there and I see that they have coffee as well right I think good I'll go and get myself a hot steaming cup of joe now behind the coffee machine there there's a sign up in the wall and it says helium balloons 75 cents I see an opportunity for comedy so I waited in line and the guy behind the counter says can I help you sir and I said yes I would like a cup of coffee and he says okay yeah you own anything in that I said yes I'd like some helium he now he looks at me he looks back at the side and he says that's only for balloons there's an old there's an old adage never never joke never joke with the tradespeople rule number one in comedy never joke with oh man no why don't I just start off with a with a question here just just how pissed off are you I've never asked that question in many years let me give you a little piece of advice you you keep using language like that and you're gonna find yourself out of a job over 10 years a long time when you first came on this show and I can remember I remember the very first joke I remember you doing on the show mm-hmm and it had to do with brushing your teeth when the toothpaste congeals in the sink all right it makes those little hard things you said you chipped them out and serve them for dessert mints right just to show you I can still read on what you did now with all that's been going on and all the stuff that's been in the papers and then conjecture and theory by the critics and the people because if you know your friend your friend of yours is taking over here next me and you I said there were rumors of paper you're gonna firebomb NBC you're gonna do all well I hate waiting in line don't start with Shaughnessy in the rimshots will never get through anything so you want to address this you address it it's a no I'm not angry I'm not angry at NBC about this I'm not angry at Jay Leno about this not not angry at you or The Tonight Show about this I mean realistically if it were not for you I wouldn't wouldn't have a show and you know I wouldn't have socks actually if it weren't for you and now if the network had come to me and they say Dave we'd like you to have this show and then then a week later they said Dave we don't want you to have the show then you could be angry about right but I have a show if you do and an NBC can can do whatever they want with this show so I was I was never never angry now would I would I like to have the show sure that's honest I'd like to be looking at new upholstery now and from what I know of you a guy can make a pretty comfortable living doing the show if you play your cards right and don't give it all away you can you can you in visit yourself we're gonna finish it almost 30 years in make and you envision yourself 20 years from now doing that your late night I don't I don't know how you've done it I don't you know 10 years to me seems like some nights it seems like it's been 10 years no I don't I don't I don't think we got much beyond you know 10 years seems just about right sometimes yeah anyway but you know the question the question to ask maybe well they said 10 years may you said maybe you long enough they don't want you to you know part of the problem is the answer is incomplete because it wasn't paying close attention to the question I forgot what I asked we have to do the computers right so we can finish up with this one we come back Absalom they were
moonlanding,"At age 11, Taylor Wilson told his parents that he wanted to build a nuclear reactor in the family garage. His parents never guessed he would do it, but three years later Taylor made history.

This Teenager Will Revolutionize Nuclear Power | Archives | NBC News",This Teenager Will Revolutionize Nuclear Power | Archives | NBC News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PINttscIAEo,0,1380608,18196,1274,4672,PINttscIAEo,most of us are unable to build our very own nuclear reactor at least in our teenage years who has the tools and the space you're about to meet taylor wilson who has in fact already achieved that rare milestone and is looking at a better than average future in the world of science tonight harry smith introduces us to the young man who's been surprising people for his entire young life i found it based off a 1955 thesis spend a few minutes with taylor wilson and you know you're with an extraordinary person hike with him in the mountains of western nevada and you will learn what makes him tick and this is just a pile from when they dug out the mine right exactly rarely does a minute go by it seems when taylor is not thinking about atoms and all the things he wants to make them do there is constant disintegration and emitting of energy going on around us right now from all this radioactivity and there's something very powerful about being able to manipulate that right controlling that power for by harnessing nuclear energy 19 year old taylor wilson thinks he can make the world a better safer place and he might just be the one to do it have you thought about i could be a person who changes the world that's what i've always wanted to do i don't think i want to die or go out of this world without doing something that has a huge impact i hope that my contribution will be you know clean fusion energy which is incredibly abundant and very powerful but you know completely clean clean nuclear fusion the colliding of atoms to create energy the heretofore unreachable solution to the world's energy needs and if you don't think he's serious get this at 14 taylor built his own nuclear reactor which led us to wonder how exactly do you raise a genius taylor wilson was born in texarkana arkansas his dad kenneth is a coca-cola bottler his mom tiffany is a former yoga teacher they say they haven't a clue where taylor gets his smarts do you have any geniuses in your family not to my knowledge we're just hard-working people and how about you no no one with an interest in science so we're not sure where he came from wherever he came from his parents quickly saw he was more than just smart there are five things involved in a space lodge as a little boy taylor was obsessed with space but it was the power of the atom that truly energized his intellect even the head of nuclear engineering at the university of tennessee was in awe they just started conversing and we get ready to leave and he said taylor he said i know it's going to be several years but when you get ready to go to college i have a scholarship for you when he was eight yes and i walked out of that building that day i said there's something special here that i've got to treat special so tiffany and kenneth went out of their way to feed taylor's interests but the real shocker everything taylor knows about nuclear science he taught himself thanks to the internet my entire learning process was building experiments and buying equipment and collecting the stuff and seeing how it reacted in elementary school he began amassing all things radioactive many items manufactured before there was an awareness of the danger involved this is stuff that you started collecting when you were a little kid yeah all radioactive all radioactive a lot of the stuff you wouldn't expect like these consumer items but this plate is quite intensely radioactive so i got to a point where i'd collected a bunch of this stuff and i realized that i wanted to make something radioactive and so you know at the time i didn't have weapons-grade plutonium laying around the house and so i realized i the easiest way to do it would build a fusion reactor at 11 little taylor told his parents of his big plan to build a nuclear reactor in the family garage and at least sure taylor you can yeah i mean we thought you know he'll never do that but taylor was like that you know anything he did you know he was gonna do were you ever afraid for him we were scared to death just to be honest but if taylor was gonna learn he had to experience it while taylor was pulling together the pieces for his reactor he was bored silly in junior high ken and tiffany found the solution in reno nevada the davidson academy for the profoundly gifted the only thing i was worried about would be a school for nerds a school so selective they admit a tiny handful of the most brilliant students taylor and his younger brother joey a math whiz both got in so the wilsons moved to reno davidson sits on the university of nevada campus taylor quickly found the professor with a pedigree in fusion research nuclear physicist ron feneth when i met taylor he was 13 and he was under five feet tall and he was going to build this reactor in the garage and all the time he was talking i was thinking if i were his parents i don't think i'd want a reactor in my garage fanaf offered taylor a corner of his lab instead once you got to know him and started working with him did you think prodigy yeah it didn't take me long to come to the conclusion that this was a prodigy probably one of the most brilliant people if not the most brilliant person i've ever met just five months after he met dr faneff taylor made nuclear fusion not the kind that could create an endless energy supply but an important step to that ultimate goal i started jumping up and down and high fiving i mean i was i was very excited he was 14 years old making him the youngest person ever to do it see if we can crank this thing up he showed us how it works and we almost understood it oh there we go wow so that's the plasma this is the same basic nuclear reaction that's constantly taking place in the sun and all the stars you've recreated what happens inside a cell exactly replace the gravity uh and the large quantities of fuel with a very small amount of fuel and essentially electricity but creating fusion wasn't the end it was the beginning in that moment i thought well yeah fusion's cool but this isn't particularly novel i want to go out and actually do something now i want to challenge since then he's invented a cheaper way to make medical isotopes for cancer detection and treatment he's also built a screening system that will detect nuclear materials smuggled in shipping containers the plan is to put 10 of these things out there at ports for six months and kind of like a beta test but no i've proven that this thing can detect weapons-grade plutonium it won him first prize at the intel science fair and an invitation to the white house let's test this sucker out see if it works yeah well they wouldn't let me uh turn it on secret service really didn't want me bringing my nuclear reactor in here you got to meet the president and what did he say he said uh why haven't we hired this guy yet and he thought i was going to come work for him and you know of course i respect him in his department but i think i'm going to sell these things to him so we'll see how that goes so taylor is a genius and an entrepreneur and yes the government is interested in his invention it might also be interested in all that stuff he's been collecting what do you keep in the safe higher activity stuff stuff that's a little bit more dangerous so we've got things like yellow cake inside here you have yellow cake a little bit of yellow cake and it's quite radioactive and this is the stuff that nigeria was supposedly selling exactly and that's why we went to war in iraq so you made this yourself oh yeah that's all homemade does the department of homeland security know you have all this stuff they know it's here it's not illegal or anything like that but they definitely keep an eye on me taylor's latest idea could be an energy game changer he's reimagined a technology he says is stuck in another century the power plant designs we have right now are essentially the same reactor design we came up with in the 1950s taylor's figured out how to build mini nuclear power plants that he says will not malfunction what i developed was essentially something that is buried below the ground and it's a box you can think of it more like a battery than a reactor it's very stable it doesn't need much maintaining and it can't have these kind of accidents that are typical nuclear reactor no meltdowns no meltdowns in the event of any kind of incident in the reactor all the radiation stays inside exactly with the help of a teal fellowship that pays him to skip college he's starting his own company to bring these reactors and other ideas to market he's going to do something that's going to change the world i feel really privileged to have him come along during the last few years of my own career it's been really fun it's been a great ride taylor is also enjoying the ride but only he can envision the road ahead are you on the ground floor of your own imagination i've got a lot more ideas in fact i won't be able to get through them all probably in my lifetime but i'm working on what i can and it's only going up from here how incredible is he harry smith with our report tonight from reno nevada
moonlanding,"Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques is getting used to being back in Earth's gravity after returning from a six-month stay aboard the International Space Station, breaking Robert Thrisk's Canadian record set in 2009.

Through regional and national programming on multiple platforms, including CBC Television, CBC News Network, CBC Radio, CBCNews.ca, mobile and on-demand, CBC News and its internationally recognized team of award-winning journalists deliver the breaking stories, the issues, the analyses and the personalities that matter to Canadians.",David Saint-Jacques returns after 204 days in space,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQxigmHZJXg,0,18791,186,34,90,gQxigmHZJXg,Canadian astronaut David saint-jacques has safely landed on earth and you see that puff of smoke that means the soft landing engines have fired and the capsule is on the ground after a wild six-hour ride the Soyuz capsule carrying st. Jacques and two other crew members touched down in Kazakhstan late last night st. jaques was carried from the pod feeling the pull of gravity for the first time in months pulling him out now also getting around to the falls and giving a thumbs up to the crowd NASA says the crew are all in good health and headed to Houston to get checked out it was a mission of milestones for st. Jacques and the Canadian space program he performed his first spacewalk we watched that right here and who could forget that cosmic catch with the Canada arm - he's in the record books also for the longest single space flight by a Canadian two hundred and four days and more than 30 there when the capsule landed and he light leads off our coverage this morning well pretty incredible scene here in the vastness of Kazakhstan's grasslands you can see people are walking right up to the capsule and putting their hands on it I'm not going to do that because I'm told there still might be an issue of radio I know I know it's all thank you it's anyway we've been told not to do that but now it's on me anyway a pretty incredible scene it landed almost flawlessly about ten kilometres up we could hear actually we could see it before we could hear it we saw the giant parachute almost a thousand metres wide and then and then the capsule drifting down below it and then a couple seconds later a bang and that was from the sound of the parachute being released everyone a very large military contingent ten helicopters all sorts of observers from NASA and Russian space agency everyone rushed over here and not long afterwards the astronauts began emerging from the capsule for David saint-jacques perhaps he had the worst of the three of them he didn't he didn't look good he looked like he had that was feeling extremely nauseous given the impact of gravity on your body yeah so just fell back from the sky gravity is not my friend but the you know what's striking me is the smell of grass the smell of the wild grass here it's just beautiful and thank you like you're all messed up inside or what yeah I mean gravity is not my friend I I'm having these you know I need to learn to walk again and McClain on the other hand the American she actually smiled she said she told me when I asked her she's ready to go right back up there again astronauts are getting checked out at a medical tent and they'll soon be on their way back to North America they'll be airlifted straight to Kerry ganda and then a flight to Houston Chris Brown CBC News in central Kazakhstan David saint-jacques says he needs as you heard there to learn to walk again after setting a Canadian record for the longest single spaceflight at 204 days he touched down back in Kazakhstan safely and on schedule but the process of readjusting to gravity is only just beginning pulling the first effects of gravity after a hundred eighty eight days of weightlessness that's Bob Thirsk from the Canadian Space Agency the flight engineer wrapping up his six months in space our next guest is one of the few people in Canada who can tell us about that readjustment phase that's Robert Circe back in 2009 coming home from his time on the ISS he spent 187 days in space flight and 204 days in total in space spread across the two missions and Robert Thirsk is in our Montreal studio this morning good morning to you good morning Aarthi so first I wanted to just point out that you were smiling as you were listening to David saint-jacques speak about the fact that gravity is not his friends what did that what came to your mind that rotten that big smile to your face well he's experiences are very similar to mine experiences as well on that first day it's it's difficult coming back every organ system the body has to read just to this one G world that we take for her granted including his cardiovascular system which may not be pumping blood quite as strongly post-flight as it did pre-flight to his brain so he's feeling a little bit lightheaded right now and then he talks about the stability and orientation problems as well the vestibular apparatus which is our balance mechanism in her inner ear was not my friend on landing day as well and I I had difficulty maintaining an upright position and I needed someone to hold me at the side so that I didn't fall over its it sounds silly but all these problems reverse themselves after 12 or 24 hours back on earth he'll be fine later today and I also wanted to ask you I was watching as you were listening to your own return to earth as we played that tape back from 2009 what is it like for you to replay that on such a significant day where we know what's happened with you know so many years later with another Canadian astronaut you know I had the good fortune to represent Canada twice in space and from those two missions I have a lifetime of thousands of memories to live back it's a mountaintop experience that is impossible to describe so now I have David saint-jacques as as another Canadian who's gone through the same kind of experience as myself and Chris Hadfield and I look forward to sharing a beverage with him and that in the days to come and recounting some of his experiences in comparing them to what I experienced it's it's a unique experience flying in space it's like a surreal it's like walking inside a Salvador Dali painting you know if you're walking into this surreal world with different experiences that it's hard to describe to everyone else but I can hopefully talk to David and Chris Hadfield in the days to come and we can compare notes now we were talking about how it is that you were actually watching the reor 'but for David saint-jacques so you work with families and an experts as well so tell us a little bit about your experience watching this all unfold well I was at the Canadian Space Agency in Montreal last evening there was a few hundred of David's and Jacques and his spouse's family and friends and then of course colleagues or employees from the from the Space Agency they're you know the the Soyuz vehicle is a very reliable vehicle our Russian partners are well experienced with descent in back to earth but you know I'm typically very concerned about both the descent and the landing there are still risks significant risks associated with spaceflight so it's good to share those moments with close friends and with colleagues and as you mentioned earlier it all unrolled perfectly last night they the engine firing the descent through the atmosphere the the landing were on schedule and everything was nominal so it's I'm very grateful for for that it's nice to share those moments with close friends now aside from of course the milestones that were reached by Saint Jacques we also know that this almost could be somewhat of a pivotal moment when it comes to the future of space exploration when we see the longest space flight for example with 204 consecutive days what does this mean for the future of space exploration and Canada's role well Canada through David's and Jaques mission has become even more experienced in space operations so space walks David did another spacewalk flow by a Canadian he did robotic manipulation with the canadarm2 for example assembly of the space station repair of the space station these are the kinds of skills and the kind of mindset that Canada and the international partners need to explore deep space so yeah you're right the international space station program is is winding down we'll continue to fly to the station and do experiments aboard the station for the next several years but we're looking forward to deep space exploration a return to the moon a visit to an asteroid and then perhaps in 15 years or so from now walking on the planet Mars for a number of good good reasons so the kind of skills that debate developed during the last six seven months are the kinds of skills that we're going to need to push the frontiers further into deep space well it is always a pleasure to hear you speak about this extraordinary experience thank you so much for your time today Robert thank you and that was Canadian astronaut Robert Thirsk and

who was more impressive would you say Wilder Furion last weekend's fight fury I think to a certain extent if we're gonna be honest here right it was supposed to be water was exposed you know he's a guy that he can punch like heck you know I always say on ESPN that punches are born and I made he was born to punch he's got the power in the right hand there's no no two ways he's long he's he's big and he's got a heart but I as far as technique pretty bad you know the I mean it's the kind of fight where the referee if you're the referee you might want to take insurance out before the fight because you might get hit I mean he's going from left field from right field he's fallen or bounces right foots cold in front of his left foot I mean it's I think there's no way to say I know a lot of people won't say because they want to be friends with everybody I get it but if you're gonna put me in that position and talk about expertise on something I'm supposed to be talking about well then that's called the way it is he he got exposed in a lot areas except for one that he's got that great eraser and that great eraser can show itself at any time well I did I agree with you and I and I said as much and I think max did as well but I would ask you this question do you think it's something that can be rectified for him to have dominion and dominance over the heavyweight division or do you think the inevitability of him falling to the likes of somebody like an Anthony Joshua is imminent because of those lack of skill I answered in two ways first of all if he hasn't learned by now he's not learning okay that speed really straight about that he's been a pro for five years whatever six years whatever it is he hasn't learned now he you know then it's not like they're waiting for some special you know day to debut these great skills and to show you that he's technically become really solid if they were waiting you'd have to say well what are you waiting for I mean it should have been done by now so if they haven't done it by now if they haven't shown that he can show that level of expertise from the technical standpoint now no it's not coming by Teddy but the other part to Stevens question is as long as he's got that power you know what he's got a chance I mean you could see him being arrogant in certain way and say hey you know I don't need to throw a jab straight I don't need to keep my feet right I don't need to move my head when a punch comes I got this so you can see a little bit because so far it's work for him goodnight teddy yeah I remember something you once told me we were watching fights at the late great Jack Newfield house who's a celebrated journalist in those in the second half of the 20th century and his country kids if you didn't know and and you made a comment we were watching old fight films and you made a comment about Rocky Marciano that always stuck with me great fighters cuz people would criticize his technique in certain ways like Wilder he was built up against tomato cans before he fought good fighters and and they criticized his defense and you said all great fighters know how to do two things how to land their punches and avoid a certain number of the punches coming toward them and when I look at wilder of course technically all those things are true meantime he has his own way of avoiding enough punches and landing his own that so far he's undefeated in these forties and he's fought fury so does he really need to tighten those things or is he developed his own style that works yeah you know what that's a fair point but I'm going to hit that point with one thing the level of opponents his love oh and you touched on him with rocky you know that they all the champions all the heavyweight champions all the division champions they all have a resume of guys who are questionable on the way up there's no doubt about it and then you fight the better guys and Marciano fought a lot of good guys people would say they were old Miss Joe Walcott was great when it was all ladies yeah he was great late in his career as a Charles one of the great fighters of all time so yeah you know Monty I don't beat a lot of good fighters water has never fought that level the level I just talked about from that era why does never fought that level his party's success has been that they picked the opponent's pretty well Ortiz was the best guy and you know he got rid of him with the power and he was losing that fight so part of that part of him hiding from the from the lack of technique or being able to overcome the lack of technique hasn't really been because of some special instincts that you talk about awkward cleverness and I get it Marciano was real good way he'd start one hand bank and he told the other hand little tricks little genius things that he did to be the great fighter that he was at the polo fight out of the fire when he had to the one thing about water I haven't really seen those things again I give his credit to the opponents or the lack of opponents that he's faced and also to his heart that Daddy that he's never out of it he knows he has the power and he will step up the tempo when he has to tell you I want to transition to a fight that's taking places on our network tomorrow and night with Roman chenko versus Pedraza I think about Roman chenko and I want to throw this at both you and Max Roman chenko is almost depressing this guy's phenomenal the footwork the hands mean he's just on another level it would be nice to see him knock people out except for the vast majority of his fights lately they literally quit I mean they've literally literally quit and it's not like they wobbled and staggered to the bench or whatever I've seen guys and obviously they look like they were going to get knocked out they look like they literally beat up but they literally walked over to their stool with all their faculties in order and basically said I can't beat this guy this guy looks that phenomenal talk to me about how good Loman chenko is and what is it about him that's literally making guys quit not his last fight there's a body shot but out about three fights before that last three fights before that it's making guys quit talk to me about that not only making guys quit and you're right yeah thousand percent right making good guys quit make the undefeated guys quit make world champions quit make gold medalist quit like rigging the ow yeah and you know what did what it is is that first of all what he does is he takes people's souls yeah I say it again he takes men's souls he makes fighters do something that is not permissible something that when you put the gloves on when you're kidding you start you're never supposed to do he makes them say no mas he makes them submit as you said he makes them quit you're not supposed to do that as a fighter he's supposed to go down on your shield now I get a lot of people gonna argue hey Tony you know but he could get hurt I get it but I'm just talking about the pure definition of a fighter when you get in that ring yeah you're supposed to be a warrior go out on your field he makes people do what they say they would never do and the way he does it well he takes their hope away
moonlanding,"May 5 (Bloomberg) --- Bloomberg's ""The Next Space Race"" is a journey through the booming business of space exploration. The International Space Station is a near zero-gravity laboratory dedicated to scientific research. The end of NASA's shuttle program in 2011 left the world with only one way to get there, buy a seat from the Russians. NASA is holding a competition challenging private enterprise to build America's next spacecraft. Boeing, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada are all multi-billion dollar aerospace companies competing to win the NASA contract that could cement dominance in the emerging space industry. Bloomberg gets rare access to these space pioneers, including a tour of SpaceX with CEO Elon Musk. (Source: Bloomberg)

Next Shuttle,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0i1pdHJmzM,0,1335941,6590,400,1403,W0i1pdHJmzM,"the first time we were racing into space it was about national pride the eagle has wings this time it's about money the international space station is a near zero-gravity laboratory dedicated to scientific research the end of NASA's shuttle program left the world with only one way to get there Russia we're proposed to pay over seventy million dollars per seat to the Russians just to go to the space station it's just kind of embarrassing that the United States has to thumb rides from the Russians there is a better way a new shuttle will soon take flight but NASA won't be making it private companies will and liftoff of the Falcon 9 rocket and dragon we're building this in anticipation of a market emerging NASA is hosting a competition for private enterprise to build a spacecraft to shuttle humans back and forth to low-earth orbit and that contract will be worth billions I think commercial space today is much like commercial aviation was back in the late 20s and 30s it's being enabled by the government but eventually it's going to take off there's competition and competition is good contenders in this heated race Boeing SpaceX and Sierra Nevada and the stakes are high all multibillion-dollar aerospace companies each determined to win the NASA contract in order to become the leader in the emerging space industry SpaceX is the youngest contender born in 2002 from PayPal billionaire Elon Musk his company set out with a lofty mission to colonize Mars do you ever question if you're crazy yes I think it's important to question your sanity because at the point which you stopped questioning your sanity you're probably insane SpaceX's dragon is a capsule design meant to hold both crew and cargo and can stay in orbit for up to two years how much cheaper is it going to be to send an astronaut to the International Space Station using dragon dragon can take up to seven people and if nASA uses the full complement of crew and orders for per year we can do it for twenty million dollars per person it's a lot cheaper than the 72 million dollars person yeah the SpaceX Dragon capsule is launched into space by the company's own rocket called Falcon 9 dragon is the first commercial spacecraft in history to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return to Earth a mission previously achieved by only three nations this is the first Dragon spacecraft you can see the the heat shield and the scorch marks this came in like a flaming meteor how did it feel and when that came back in one piece hey  right it's like wow I can't believe it work we're kind of like a Silicon Valley technology company that's doing space what qualifies you to put human beings in outer space every launch of the Falcon 9 rocket which is the rocket that would carry astronauts has succeeded so it's got a hundred percent success rate which is I mean the best success rate of any rocket ever boeing is known for airplanes but they actually have a long history in space since nasa's beginning boeing has been a contractor on every manned space program including building the parts for the international space station boeing has been in human space flight from day one and so it's just part of our core we see this as just the next huge opportunity for Boeing and for NASA how big do you expect the market to be the development price itself is such a huge barrier just a very different business model than Boeing's used to our huge development programs are typically centered around commercial airplanes a military aircraft where there is a lot of orders and right now the foundation of the business is two flights a year Boeing's cst-100 is also a capsule they're weld list design makes their craft stronger and lighter than traditional models how many astronauts will fly in this capsule right now we've configured it to fly up to five but the cst-100 is designed for up to seven we have a significant experience obviously in capsules from mercury and Gemini Apollo the capsule was was an easy decision what about comfort this isn't exactly the most comfortable position I've ever been in no absolutely but you could have a very rough landing we needed to make sure that this design would would satisfy even the roughest potential landing and then there's aerospace insiders Sierra Nevada you've probably never heard of that despite the fact that they launched something into orbit about every two to three weeks Sierra Nevada has been around for over 50 years one of the things people see when they come here it's wonderful technology they see a spaceship that's already flying in a short period of time you guys are up against Boeing and SpaceX what makes you think that you can take them on how many people knew Google before they started we think dreamchaser is the best transportation system for what we do in space it's almost like we're building the iPad and other people are building the apps in the future from that iPad Sierra Nevadas Dream Chaser design is the only one in the competition that is not a capsule it's a lifting body one model is the only one that actually looks like the shuttle what's interesting about this is actually the volume inside is as much usable volume as the Space Shuttle had we could put seven people it would be a comfortable fit and they could stay in space for several days if they need to with enough supplies really like a space SUV yes so far there hasn't been a capsule that's taken humans that's gone up to space so one might have to build 20 or 30 or 40 capsules to do the same thing that we can do with one space vehicle when you look at the economics of that that's a really important thing all right let's jump in this simulator okay look at the fast I see the runway right there yeah doesn't fly like an airplane but it lands like an airplane the fact that the Dream Chaser requires a landing strip that sets it apart from the competition for us we can land pretty much on any runway 8,000 feet or longer in the world because we don't enter like a capsule we pull a lot less G's on entry we come in at a very low one and a half GS so you can come in land on a runway with a sensitive payload the scientists can get to that payload within 30 minutes because it's right there on the runway every spacecraft ever flown by NASA has been built by a commercial company and increasingly the government has transferred the financial and physical risk of the business to private enterprise is there something at risk with these big businesses entering into the space industry the organization NASA that had done this for many many years is not doing it so we are sort of sticking our necks out a little bit we're taking a group of people corporations that really hadn't been at the development level and we're sort of thrust in there and saying you go produce make a safe system for me and come back and let me know when you're done but the benefit is that we get back and forth much simpler conquering a new frontier requires having a destination for NASA that place is the International Space Station it's the most expensive single object ever created projected to cost the u.s. eight billion dollars in the end ISS costs 60 billion and that's not including operating costs or the initial cost of the shuttle program all in the price tag is an estimated 150 billion dollars ISS infrastructure is expected to last until 2028 before requiring costly maintenance the government funding has only been committed until 2024 if a manned commercial space shuttle won't launch before 2017 commercial companies will be left with little time to make a profit to justify the cost these private companies are betting that there is business beyond ISS there is a potential for a huge business opportunity there is going to be an incredibly robust and interesting capability to get not just American astronauts back and forth to low-earth orbit but perhaps paying commercial customers someday to a destination it certainly doesn't exist today fast forward 10 years I wish I could look in my crystal ball and say that this is going to take off and in a matter of 15 or 20 years we're going to have a couple space stations orbiting the Earth perhaps a hotel back and forth to which we take you know wealthy but paying passengers nonetheless it's about when you build it will they come the original space race was driven by nationalism the new space race driven by the bottom line of private enterprise in my case I have an ideological Drive the thing that really matters is to establish a base on on Mars might be worse to become a multi-planet species establishing an insurance policy full for life itself Elon Musk has sunk 100 million dollars of his own fortune into SpaceX you see then the Commercial Crew program as a step in that direction is that why this is important to SpaceX it's gonna be helpful towards creating a base on Mars for Boeing SpaceX or Sierra Nevada winning this contract would secure their company's survival whoever wins this contest they set to be the next major player in space exploration yeah I really think so this is the time well this design die if Boeing does not win the NASA contract we'd have to go back and see whether you could close the business case by moving forward without the help from NASA on the development what will it mean for Sierra Nevada if you lose this race if you don't win the contract by time this decision is gets made we would have had a lot of maturity on the vehicle so there is a strong likelihood that we will be able to take what we've learned and move it to other markets it would slow us down because we would have less money to spend in that direction but we continue launching satellites as well as launching cargo to the space station and bringing cargo back from the space station every spacecraft we've ever flown has been built by a commercial company this is just another way of procuring that spacecraft I'm convinced that we will have a reliable safe spacecraft when the time comes to assign that country the more we test ourselves and the more we push exploration those smarter and the better we benefits in our DNA to explore that's what draws us to space we need to continue to go beyond what we currently know you"
moonlanding,The Girl in the Spider's Web,Claire Foy Is Hilarious,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kh-xRfFvstU,0,93273,738,10,27,Kh-xRfFvstU,did you take anything when you left it seemed like that's a set where a lot of good stuff to steal under they keep under lock and key yeah they need it all as well so they'd know who taken it right when one cast leaves and another one comes in they have a lot of everything yeah I have nothing the worst thing I can do is be terrible so hopefully what you would beyond that there's a process that could have got me something positive at the end of that somewhere I loved being blonde you did yeah yeah it's a the whole blondes have more fun thing is actually actual I mean even have fun but people are just nice they're just nicer to you your blood they are yeah really see you would have experienced this cuz you're like me but all you're all I find now correct me if I'm wrong but I find this Swedish accent is very very friendly and very when it's spoken in English particularly and it's very joyful it's a very joyful tonight encourage good enough so can you say what you said now we're the Swedish no spontaneous no I is not great can do anything any given moment get a pillow that's it just thinking just thinking about things I've strangled a couple of people in some films but that's like a one that happens one I've had to do continuous kind of like 15 minutes have been nice to be called Queen all the time yeah I guess that's a good point as I'm thinking about all Queen we got trouble again did you get any permanent or were they all know I tried horrible you tried them on I tried them on and then wash them off you you asked yeah I swear it's an actual thing people hold the door open to you they smile at you just in general yeah and this happened to you now at all no no not when do you find the anger in yourself oh just anything is carp it makes me angry I think it's really important to be in nature just to protect it and understand it and nurture it and be natural in the nature you certainly shook that off right away by going from the Queen to Lisbeth Salander in this film yeah yeah it makes me look like I've got psychological problems oh yeah I'm playing Janet Armstrong who's Neil Armstrong's wife Oh in the the ring us yeah I've heard this movie this I'm sorry was that I'm not an American I feel like a bit the fraud because she's very yeah we know you're not really her yeah you were married and Neil arms I have no idea but let's get into that later I apologize in a bomb no the thing is that when they're having a tantrum you should be able to go you the adult goes look at you ridiculous person what are you doing whereas in ourselves we go no yeah I started debate yeah you can't be you can't debate with the imagine that was an adult who was going I want to banana you couldn't go why do you want a banana you just go okay you calm down from me now I'm going up here to be a normal person and you can just you know okay just pawn you know whatever and get on with life I love sport because it just makes me you know feel alive it makes me you know I move and III exist and you know I I sweat which I really decide hate people sweating anywhere near me all around me me sweating more tattoos than the crown I mean that's right oh man that would be a fun thing to find out yeah I don't know so if you had to choose between the Queen or Elizabeth is there a character that you you enjoyed playing more oh no I love them all I feel like that'd be a betrayal of all the character being British are you very excited about Christmas yeah good love it you do you have love puddings and stuff yeah yes yes you do these are a big part of it chocolate I mean the real America's big but in in England it's a giant it's like kind of Thanksgiving dinner kind of right we have but Thanksgiving you put marshmallows on stuff and things so you know unsavory I mean not me personally but yes our country's been known to put marshmallows on a lot of things yeah me telling myself certain things about life doesn't necessarily mean that I should I'm right and that you know all evidence to the contrary you know I've never actually died in a plane crash so as of yet Oh God rude approachable really I don't want people to think that I am have different them just don't think I am a warranty because they're just really unapproachable it's a trunk so it's like a giant child's transfer tattoo but just on my back all of them were and some of them were easier to get off than others the one on my arm the big black bands that on my arm and ankle I often would be at kind of family parties and then look down and go if the Queen had a bunch of tattoos and again this is just me blue skying and Jamie let's do this I wish it was some kind of map yeah like just every part of her that you can't see enclosed there's like some sort of map that's very key yeah I know she's a queen and so like they you know they put it on her I think I first met you at that party before the Golden Globes and I was like I just knew it I go man you're gonna win the Golden Globe for this but you say that to every single person you met that night so he didn't have a speech no have you seen my acceptance speech it was awful might not be improvised it was improvised and and just like I just couldn't stop why am i shaking stop shaking put it together come on come on come on you know it's really important to kind of find space yourself in the streets were only ever so busy people people people people people all the time so it's pretty hard out about I'd much prefer if she had like Prince Philip on one arm yeah that would be on the other core yeah yeah Hatton bag just yeah but like so not just according like Corgi fo the client you'd have a sleeve oh yeah oh right cuz they don't I mean this is a spoiler but all those corgis haven't lived as long as she has she's gone she's gone three loads yeah this is season two of the crown and you play the Queen but this is this is your last season you're out into this yeah play spent all the money on the first three so we're just in a shed miss you you're so great you won't you'll forget all about me and the rest look at you I'm not gonna forget about you the warm-up act it's just for me really I'm gonna change my my profile this is filmed in Stockholm and Berlin in the winter those are wonderful cities I've never been there in the winter they seem very cold and gray yes yeah I mean cold more than gray they have some beautiful crisp morning you still don't know if the actual Queen washes them yeah no we'll never know that you'll never know no unless she goes I did watch it and then I'll be like I knew it what's gonna happen this Friday when I binge watch Netflix I don't know yes isn't it happen to me what's gonna happen in the season asleep eventually yeah yeah I worked very hard you must have been no cold a lot I was called a lot there I definitely vary in size I tried to put as many thermal layers underneath as humanly possible so sometimes I'm a bit like a sausage my leather outfit like bursting at the seams there are scenes where you can tell you can't really my god yeah we got to go over here I'm wild I think I've shown that I'm wild like really like crazy and people gonna watch it and think I'm wild uh then I was when I was the queen I was happy for you that you got it hey was happy for you that's really kind cuz I first said are you sure that's okay I kind of feel like you were a nice person so thank you

1980s the NBA was very very different the game was much more physical and a lot of the plays that are now called technical and flagrant fouls were just routine plays back then the culture amongst the players was also incredibly different trash-talking was at its peak and players from different teams legitimately hated each other players were not going on cruise ships together or would ever be caught dead on a banana boat together the offseason focus was on destroying one another and definitely not scheming to join forces the competition was incredibly fierce and there was no shortage of both personal and team rivalries one of the most iconic teams of the 80s were the Detroit Pistons the 1980s were physical days of basketball but the Pistons took that to another level entirely the squad was full of strong characters guys like Dennis Rodman the tenacious and scrappy defender a wild-card who played with hustle and heart unmet by his peers Rick Mahorn the enforcer who you definitely did not want to aggravate Bill Laimbeer the savage big man who seemed to enjoy being hated more than anything else and was always seemingly involved in the middle of every fight they were led by none other than Isiah Thomas the general a quick 6 1 point guard with a bigger-than-life smile off the court but a cold-blooded killer on it he was a driven leader with a clutch gene and had the courage to stand up to anyone together they were a group notorious for their Swagger attitude and extremely aggressive defense which is putting it lightly the squads motto became domination by intimidation and Lee certainly lived up to it Detroit was often criticized for what was seen as an extremely dirty style of play It was as if any given night you could turn on the television and see the Pistons players in a full-fledged brawl and no one would be surprised their reputation transcended sports as the team was pointing to the Raiders of the NBA due to their bad-boy image and their aggressive attitudes the players and fans embrace the comparison as did the Oakland Raiders organization going as far as sending official Raiders memorabilia to the Pistons players and coaches the numbers spoke for themselves though the eighties pistons were one of the elite defensive units in the league a year in and year out meanwhile the young and upcoming Chicago Bulls were led by Michael air jordans you know this guy even in his younger years before all the championships he wasn't just an NBA superstar he was a rock star an American icon he already earned the respect of other stars around the league but as far as the Pistons they seem to be particularly repulsed by Jordans flair in the 1987 season Jordan showed the Pistons what he was capable of dropping 61 points in an absolutely dominant effort leading the Bulls to a 125 120 overtime victory just one year later on an Easter Sunday in front of a nationally televised audience Jordan embarrassed the Pistons again this time dropping 59 points in a 112 110 victory this infuriated Pistons head coach Chuck Daly who then promised after the game to never allow Jordan to torch them again later that season Chuck would have the opportunity to uphold his promise the two teams met in the 1988 Eastern Conference semifinals the Pistons had just finished with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference Jordan was coming off of an MVP and Defensive Player of the Year season despite Michaels best efforts Chicago was no match for Detroit in a seven-game series with Detroit winning this series comfortably four games to one the following year when the 1989 playoffs began Jordan had a site set on revenge this time the two teams met in the Eastern Conference Finals the Bulls were able to win one of the first two games in Detroit and then when the series returned to Chicago it appeared as if nothing was going to stop Michael Jordan then with the ball in his hands for the final moments Jordan did what Jordan does with Chicago now leading the series two games to one Isiah Thomas was left Restless that evening trying to figure out how to stop Jordan Isiah called his teammate and co-captain Joe Dumars and that evening they were up until the middle of the night contemplating planning and scheming at two o'clock in the morning Isiah calls the coaching staff with one clear message I figured out what we need to do to stop Michael Jordan and in that moment the Jordan rules were born the Pistons then approached the next game with a whole new level of ferocity and intensity and the results were evident information began to leak to the press of the Jordan rules but then when asked about the rules the Pistons sarcastically pretended as if they didn't exist the Jordan rules had multiple components but few were essential rule number one forced Michael into traffic if Jordan was on the strong side of the court forced him towards the middle and collapsed the defense upon him if Jordan was on the middle of the floor Thorsten to the left where the help defender is waiting to meet him rule number two make someone else beat you Bill Laimbeer was quoted to say we don't worry about Pippen as far as we're concerned there Jordan and the Jordanaires the Pistons were constantly throwing multiple defenders at MJ and showed little respect for the other Bulls players in the floor but they believed if Jordan wasn't going to beat them then the Bulls definitely wouldn't rule number three make Jordan work harder the Pistons began to attack the Bulls offensively with whichever player Michael was guarding the concept was that with Jordan using so much energy on the defensive end there was little energy left over for him on the offensive end and rule number four punished Jordan the Pistons would no longer allow any easy baskets to Michael when Jordan got to the paint they put him on his butt that was the rule and they did it over and over again the formula worked and the Bulls would not win another game in the series fast forward to the month of June and the Detroit Pistons were in B champions sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers four games to zero the 1989 pistons were being considered one of the greatest defenses in NBA history but as usual they weren't without their fair share of criticism even though the team was made up of undeniable winners the stigma of a dirty team was still very present the Bulls pistons rivalry was just getting warmed up in the 1990 NBA Playoffs the Bulls and pistons met again in the Eastern Conference Finals it was an epic series with the Jordan rules in full force Jordan was again being targeted and taking an overwhelming amount of physical abuse but he was also getting his own the progression and maturation of the Bulls team was clearly seen as they forced a game 7 in Detroit but Chicago still wasn't ready to dethrone the Pistons and lost in the deciding game eliminated from the playoffs for the third straight year at the hand of the Pistons the Pistons went on to win their second straight NBA championship Michael Jordan was now hell-bent on revenge and spent the offseason in the gym growing stronger and preparing himself for the physical task of facing the Detroit Pistons once again Jordan supporting cast also had another offseason of maturation and growing as a better ballclub another meeting in this rivalry was inevitable and the two teams were set to square off again in the Eastern Conference Finals the Bulls and their leader were stronger faster and just an overall better team than the Pistons the age and wear and tear was beginning to show for the Detroit players while Chicago players were all seemingly reaching their athletic peaks it wasn't much of a series but more of a statement the Bulls dominated the Detroit Pistons and were on the verge of winning their fourth game of the series to complete the sweep over Detroit the score was a blowout in favor of Chicago and in the final minutes of the last game of the series Isiah Thomas made one of the biggest decisions of his basketball career the Detroit players had a brief discussion while on the bench of those last moments and agreed that together they would head straight to the locker room before the final buzzer had even sounded there rain was coming to an end on their terms with 7.9 seconds left the Detroit Pistons left their bench walking to the locker room while awkwardly passing by the Bulls bench refusing to shake the victors hands or even make eye contact with them this was a huge slap in the face to Chicago for refusing to shake hands which is customary for teams at the end of a playoff series it was also a black eye for the image of the league the respect level around the league for the Detroit Pistons had hit an all-time low meanwhile the Bulls were moving on to face Magic Johnson and the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals the Bulls went on to win the series in commanding fashion four games to one Michael Jordan was now an NBA champion and on top of the basketball world summer of 1991 just days after the NBA Finals have come to a close the official selection committee for the USA's Olympic basketball team were making their selections as to which NBA players would be representing their country for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona this was a huge deal it was the first time in history that NBA players would be representing the USA in the Summer Olympics the timing could not have possibly been any worse for Isiah Thomas the committee selected Michael Jordan Magic Johnson Larry Bird Scottie Pippen Clyde Drexler Charles Barkley David Robinson Chris Mullin Patrick Ewing Karl Malone John Stockton and the college phenom christian Laettner this team went on to be famously known as the dream team arguably the greatest basketball team ever assembled missing from the roster was future Hall of Fame point guard and captain of the recent two-time champion Pistons Isiah Thomas if talent alone was the determining factor in the selection process then leaving Isaiah off the team seemed like an obviously gigantic mistake oddly enough the committee had selected Detroit Pistons head coach Chuck Daly to lead the dream team in the Olympics rumors began to swirl that Michael Jordan was in fact responsible for Isiah being left off the team obviously Michael did not like Isiah the Jordan rules and the end of the 1991 series was something Michael had fresh in his memory it was believed that Michael gave the committee an ultimatum that he would not be joining the dream team if Isiah Thomas was on it on numerous occasions Michael has denied such allegations but in a book released in 2012 by author and basketball writer Jack McCallum he quotes Jordan to say rod I don't want to play if Isiah Thomas is on the team to us a selection committee member rod thorn Jordan has continued to deny those claims several players of the USA dream team have since said that they also did not want Isiah on the team Magic Johnson a longtime friend of Isaiah even said in his book nobody on that team wanted to play with him so maybe the collective voice of the players led the committee to leave Isaiah off the team or maybe the committee themselves simply didn't want him on the team but it is plausible that Michael Jordan's supposed ultimatum was the swaying factor in the selection process we may never know for sure what we do know for sure is that the 1992 dream team is one of the greatest teams of all time the Jordan era continued for many years after and that eras Detroit Pistons were never again serious title contenders with Isaiah Thomas's career coming to a somewhat bitter end and what was otherwise known as a legendary career

Smithsonian Releases High-Resolution 3-D Model of Apollo 11 
Command Module To Explore and Print
To mark the 47th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon-landing mission, the Smithsonian has made available a high-resolution 3-D scan of the command module “Columbia,” the spacecraft that carried astronauts Neil Armstrong, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon. This highly detailed model, available at 3d.si.edu, allows anyone with an internet connection to explore the entire craft including its intricate interior, which is not possible when viewing the artifact in the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. The Smithsonian is also making the data file of the model available for download so it can be 3-D printed or viewed with virtual-reality goggles. 

The 3-D scanning process for the command module was extremely challenging. The module is composed of reflective surfaces that 3-D capture devices do not read well. Its interior dashboards are made up of many components that are delicate and intricate, which also presents a challenge for many 3-D capture devices. Because of the complicated nature of this scan, the Smithsonian 3-D team worked with its technology partner, Autodesk Inc., a leader in cloud-based 3-D design and engineering software. 

Autodesk developed custom 3-D scanning equipment for the project, invented algorithms for integrating multi-sensor scan data, developed software for processing the massive data set and generated a master 3-D model of the command module.  As one of the most sophisticated scans ever made of a historic artifact, it employed seven different scanning technologies to capture nearly 1 trillion high-resolution measurements producing more than a terabyte of compressed data resulting in a highly detailed master model. Autodesk also produced animations, virtual-reality panoramas, and a unique in-browser viewing platform so Smithsonian curators can publish interpretive and interactive 3-D experiences of the command module for the public.
The scanning enabled the curatorial and collections team to get glimpses of the interior of the command module they had not seen. Protective covering over the hatch opening of the Command Module has only been removed a handful of times since the artifact came into the collection in 1971. 

During the scanning, curators rediscovered a number of instances of “astronaut graffiti” not previously known to the museum. Some of the markings include numbers and information relayed from mission control written on walls or instrument panels. There also is a hand-drawn calendar by one of the astronauts, with each day crossed out except for landing day. Seeing such details and studying the text have enhanced curators’ understanding of how the missions were conducted. Now details like these markings are available in the 3-D model. The 3-D model will also be featured in the upcoming exhibition “Destination Moon,” slated for opening at the National Air and Space Museum in 2020. 

The museum is commemorating the anniversary of the moon landing by displaying Armstrong’s Apollo 11 Lunar Exploration gloves and helmet at the Steven F. Udvar Hazy Center in Chantilly, Va. They will be on view for one year, starting July 20. The Smithsonian launched its 3-D scanning and imaging program in 2013 to make museum collections and scientific specimens more widely available for use and study. 
The Smithsonian 3-D Collection features objects from the Smithsonian that highlight different applications of 3-D capture and printing, as well as digital delivery methods for 3-D data in research, education and conservation. Objects include the Wright Flyer, a model of the remnants of supernova Cassiopeia A, a fossil whale and a sixth-century Buddha statue. The public can explore all these objects online at 3d.si.edu, a free custom-built, plug-in-free browser and download the data for their own use in modeling programs or to print using a 3-D printer.",Apollo 11 Command Module | 3D Documentation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xyiy2fiV_Mc,-1,166611,894,25,263,Xyiy2fiV_Mc,we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard the Apollo 11 mission is a historical landmark it represents so much to so many people it has become representative of of a mindset when we put our mind to something now we can accomplish it and the only part of that mission that come home is the command module it's just awe-inspiring to be the curator responsible for this for 40 years knowing how important it was to protect the object it had to be protected by a plexiglass cover but now we are removing the protective Plexiglas we have a unique opportunity to do this documentation the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum gave us incredible access to this object our team set out to 3d scan the command module the exterior and the interior to create a 3d model that we're delivering online it's probably the most complex 3d project that our team has undertaken so far the command module had many many sort of hidden nooks and crannies they were really hard to see and we need to be able to get line-of-sight to the object so we used a robotic or a motion control system to basically remotely control cameras and 3d scanners to get around all those different hidden areas that are very inaccessible the precision of the 3d measurement tools we're using is incredible we're using laser scanners that capture over a million measurement points per second at submillimeter accuracy we also used six other 3d capture methods and we're able to pull all those 3d capture methods into one cohesive 3d model so what you're seeing here is some of the really early draft data this is the raw unprocessed data and you can see at the center of this scan and shooting it's beam out in all these different directions and that generates this cloud of points and those are three-dimensional measurements that have been made and so we have to scan from many different locations in and around the object and put these jigsaw P puzzle pieces to get to make a unified home our team collected over seven terabytes of information over a two-week period this is an extraordinary amount of information the biggest challenge represented was marrying six different data sets with different levels of accuracy into one unified 3d model we found that through the data that different stories emerge technically we were aware that there were detailed communications between Mission Control and the astronauts until now we've had their voices then to be able to see that they reacted to these things by actually writing them down on the spacecraft walls I think it's sort of thrilling because you can actually imagine yourself being in the position of the astronaut there is a small rectangle with X's in it we now know that that was sort of a improvised calendar that that Mike Collins sort of created there were markings which humanize certain aspects of those things but this technology does it enables us to take the first lunar landings in a concrete form and sort of index it table of contents a way to provide a more meaningful access for the young person who just would be thrilled to know what it was like inside of a spacecraft that went to the moon and back I'm really inspired and excited about how maybe this 3d scan could inspire future generations to do great things you

two one ignition sequence has started we have I don't go don't go gets a nose we got to get down eagle God created the heaven in the earth and God said let there be light and there was light it's a long way we're here it might sound corny but Dimmu is really on it before this decade is out safely no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind so difficult or expensive to accomplish we'd like to dedicate the first step to all those who made it possible we got three coils we got to do to run us down we got to eat bro oh you won't believe it John Huston with no working on fix for the ethic Center working so far beautiful look at it on the right it will go this way we're two hours and 46 minutes into this EBA jack schmitt taking a rake sample heart rates running in the 90s I tell you there's a couple minutes three minutes okay you got it forget the soil forget the soil watch this move it in three minutes let's go don't forget the soils get this where we want it I'm sorry I thought you'd skip it that's your bag yep one scoop Schmidt they call me that's good the basic major objectives are to follow on to the previous lights especially about a 15 and especially Apollo 16 and try put together the works in the words and a paragraphs of all of our lunar exploration we hope that geologically speaking we'll be able to uncover rock types and different types of geologic finds that date back from the very beginning of the moon to the to the present time and of course the major objective here scientifically is to be better able to understand our own earth our own evolution of life as our earth knows that our own environment and maybe better predict what might happen in the future concerning civilization here on earth my golly look at that Bally dad you talk about a mysterious book employees I'm not sure I got enough guts to make a potentional all right and let me tell you this is quite a rover ride it's a sound plugin let me park down here jack the continued investigation of the Sun by looking at the soils on the moon will be enhanced at the Tarr circle site because of the existence of several surfaces that have been exposed to the Sun for varying lengths of time the soil is built up by repetitive impact on farmers each one of which throws out a little layer of ejecta every time it does that exposes a new surface to the Sun and these layers build one upon another through time and of course cosmic rays solar wind are changes in the magnetic field affect the soil and if we don't understand the Sun it's gonna be very difficult to understand how to preserve the environment that we now know because the Sun is still the prime force for change in the environment we have to deal with now there are two basic ways that we have of sampling the soil cover on the moon one is just with the scoop that I have I generally carry around and this is capable of sampling down to say 20 to 40 centimeters depending on how much time you want to spend digging then you can be fairly selective with it now it's fairly time-consuming but for certain purposes it's the best way to do it observe and learn now on the other end of the spectrum we have this very dark cover mantle as we call it over the site which from all the evidence that we now have indicates that this is fine-grained fragmental debris that resembles the kind of volcanic ash that you find in the western United States and we can predict that the age of that surface is very young relative to other rocks on the moon it may be younger now that still sounds like pretty hold rocks and on earth it is billion-year-old rock is very old rock whereas on the moon we're saying that would be one of the youngest rocks that we found so it's it's sometimes difficult to maintain this dual perspective of the earth being a very dynamic and very young geologically speaking environment whereas the moon has been very static literally billions of years the history is still important static history but it's extremely important to us as I hope I have indicated okay great oh man that's pretty nice another technique we have of sampling the surface of the moon is the use of some short core tubes then they'll get down to a depth of 70 centimeters and get a very well-preserved geometrically true sample and and that is probably one of the most valuable samples we have down to that depth for one thing and about 70 centimeters we learned on Apollo 15 you have a minimum temperature zone it's very stable the ground above it is highly insulating and that temperature is about minus 20 degrees centigrade which means it's a cold trap needs it volatile elements that are moving around within us all will tend to concentrate so we can start to learn about these trace elements about the lunar atmosphere about what kind of gases does a planet evolve the moon is not big enough to hold of gases but it is almost certainly evolving and we need to know more about that if we're going to understand the origin from our own hydrosphere it happens do we feel long thing in your hand there Dean the only one to see the bottom and right now I'll be a son of a gun it looks like what I'm walking on it's obviously not pottery it's all these very very cohesive because it the bottom of the core is not smooth is very jagged II and fragmental like okay copy that D not very good dexterity good lord Jack Schmidt having a few problems okay Oh did plummet well we do covert help psychobos please be nice and be advised at the switchboard here at MSDS and lit up by calls in the Houston Ballet Foundation requesting your services for next season I should also we hope it was worth the effort oh it's all worth the effort okay I'll get on ok ok let's go we all get a picture back at station 4 which is the crater shorty estimated driving time 16 minutes TV coming in now Nino there you go okay back that one to do it no matter which what you want to do they look station 5 in Camelot good old Camelot I think that might be gamma look at that you've got that 25 men to the station guys the priority will be more documented them in the flooring soil okay fifteen years amber iCal your dreams come in handy you learn we leave immediately John is also very philosophical thoughts think you're right around out here I disturbed everything if there was someone here way back when sometimes what China they're worried about but that's interesting thought do it you drive around on the car sir on the older tracks and figure out those is the only one to maybe ever been here very true I went there somebody's been here before okay Joe and wave a good idea we were second ideas from down here just want to end by saying with a rhythmic job you did today and really looking forward to the mark tomorrow we answer all the unanswered questions right the commercial profit at the United States of America everybody to participate another day's activity glad to hear it Ron good morning we start work early around here what the users how to think they're myself it's a Wednesday it's about 9:15 in the morning Wednesday uh-huh thank you that's why we're here answer important questions five six seven eight radar hot okay and the old map camera laser altimeter open three one six three thirty one back to the door desecrator you can really see the ejecta blanket is out goes out maybe two three clear the diameter and it looked like it has been for a diaper parenthood about a player are they not have got a neighbor about my map you know the ones got a lot more color than that I'd been led to

the north Massif TV coming in where you wouldn't believe it I would oh man what a slope there's no level spot to park here though you want me to block the wheels you got the brake on I hope you it it's a beautiful east/west split rock and this Buller got its own little track right up there why don't we sample the split first right here yeah okay I'm gonna get their shadows material okay you got a bag it's in bag 312 Bob man that's rough country in there we're just good at hey they're chips up here on top yeah looks like there's been a geologist your before it jack schmitt shooting panoramic photography oh my lens is clean yeah Jack and we see your cold visor up you may want to put it down out here in the Sun station seven is eight tenths of a kilometer east still along the base of the North Sea okay we're gonna D seven different metal rock okay I don't know I'm impressed this is the best way for me to travel uphill or downhill but like this - alleged hop I don't like that loping thing but eloping only way to go but this kinda like it biggest right then I cover grab my kangaroo I can try to pull the dust off my camera which is very frustrating very ineffective every copy a point where the dust gets overtaken and everything mechanicals with movement Roger we copy that copy it again TV a time three hours 50 minutes oh yeah Bamford looks like a blocky rim fresh impact crater right now 17 we're looking at a nominal station 9 here you got about 2 5 minutes remaining no such thing as a nominal station anymore the geology won't let it be nominal this may be the first and only one of the drivers well the geology field train has a fairly long and involved history within NASA it is evolved to a fairly sophisticated and specialized training program it started out based largely on the experience that geologists had had with training students at the university level and it became fairly clear that this was not an effective way to train highly motivated very intelligent men for the specific task of exploring the moon in the geologic sense so he gradually brought into the program some of the very finest professional teachers in geology it turns out these people as is usually the case with very fine teachers were also some of the top scientific minds in their particular areas could give the type of geological information we needed in training but in the context of the kinds of operations and the kinds of constraints that a man would be dealing with on the moon in the combination was unbeatable and we produced I think some outstanding geologic observers in a short timeframe who were more than adequately carrying out the job that was a sign they cover just grass cover underneath it's white come quickly we can't leave this is maybe the youngest mantle Raymond area we got some pretty good pictures of it I think okay Evie a time five hours 16 minutes the crew will head back toward the Lamb but so many of the countries throughout the world our feelings are with the dealings of the Apollo program our and the devil appeared time and we can't live in peace and harmony in the future in on the moon we came in the line of all mankind graduating into the beauty budgeting idiot using copy that says echo your sentiments and I got thank you and thank you look like a million-mile did it this is need and I'm on the surface I like it just history will record American challenge of today and as we leave the moon and tours petronas we leave it we came and God willing as we shall return Oh dear Cory good morning challenger and thank you for the vocal rendition from the moon there well we want to let you know we were thinking about you this morning Gordy hey Gordy and in the tradition of Apollo 8 I've got the purveyor poem for you about it a week before Christmas and all through the limp on a commander whispering not even certain examples were told and their places with care and hope that with you they soon will be there I want to move there Rose such a standard I sprang from Miami to see what was the matter done on the fret of the surface below and the lecture of optics the difference no and what to my wondering eyes should appear but a miniature rover and eight tiny reindeer and a little old driver so lively and quick I knew in a moment it must be st. Nick I heard him explain and over the hill he didn't peed merry Christmas to all and do you all got speed murder that's the first time I heard that and I gotta say that was beautiful people always said we ought to have a poet babe I don't think we've made it yet that's Jack very good get that challenger is no for liftoff and we're 52nd pound we're go that's a challenger attitude translation for dead man horse neighs retest for the birthday girl Rita attitude control freedom of control 99 rotated three take your final look at the valiant or special here we go who will begin transferring samples and other equipment into the command module and begin the process of getting themselves from Challenger into America Challenge here or you're gonna close out the Houston Challenger is going off fear okay challenger been a pleasure talking to you it's a bike a hot spitting page do a Superbird but I've got one more job to do okay here comes burns all right probably three did we get it looks like we got a good separation turning on America Euston because what you want to hear your go for a TVI epistatic okay understand America is go for dei and I will see you coming up the other side Thank You program not only has given us the first steps for that possible drape but to make the first step you bring the world together is one unit so that we can make that step that just dissipation but is the world you my honored and proud we may all have the opportunity lead mankind enjoyed the bath another smaller program this is Apollo control Apollo 17 spacecraft now approaching ever-faster to mother earth Apollo control standing by is where our second Tremonti Roger America and beginning a black Cutlass at the predicted time around a thousand feet or approximately 85 miles above the earth to the universe in doing so she established a tradition within the source heaven declare your glory Oh Lord on the moon and the stars which you set in place humble gratitude we thank you for the safe return from your heavens or these pioneers their achievements contribute to the unity of mankind and peace for all your people in this holy season amen caleb cheering going on here the control senator sliced boundless watched in real-time from every helicopter market I'm at 3:04 31 ground elapsed time even the control room here is full of people waiting for that moment when they prove is safely on the deck of a ship to fire up their traditional splashdown cigars this is Apollo control out at 305 25 ground elapsed time time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement which in many ways this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out same here no single space project in this period president to mankind more important for the law expiration space so difficult
moonlanding,Posted in tribute to the Challenger and Columbia crews. Ad astra...,Beyond the Moon: Failure is Not an Option Part 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XSiOwBx6gLQ,0,178690,0,0,0,XSiOwBx6gLQ,"they took America to the moon and safely back again they showed the world what a team can do we felt an essential to our nation to remain explorers and brought us into the next century that's how we find things that end up changing humanity they're the engineers of NASA's Mission Control who carry on the dream of space we thought our work would go on forever after reaching the moon Gene Kranz and Mission Control face even greater challenges Congress will applaud KGB was always present on the two of us with ass over teakettle into outer space it seemed like time froze everything stopped and you instantly something was really wrong we had lost the crew it is not easy it will never be easy sometimes you're gonna have to walk through a wall of fire to get I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth July 20th 1969 Apollo 11 the first moon landing 400,000 people 20,000 companies and universities eight years of work and 25 billion dollars have made good on President John Kennedy's 1961 vision project Apollo lives forever as a great American triumphs a clear goal defined and met flight director for the Apollo 11 landing the man in charge and Mission Control is Gene Kranz during Apollo we had this challenge that we had been issued by President Kennedy to land on the moon and to bring this crew back home we were fighting for the hearts and minds of the people of the free world so we knew what the goal was what the objective was with Kennedy's challenge met what should come next where should America go beyond the moon how much are we willing to spend on space and to risk today the questions that arose in 1969 are still being debated nearly half a century after reaching the moon NASA is at a crossroad searching for a vision it hasn't had since Apollo it takes more than rocket engines and computers and hardware and high temperature materials to go to the moon the the thing that made it all hang together was leadership and the will of the country to be behind us and be patient enough to allow us to do it we haven't had that since one of the things that I think always drove the space program still does to a certain extent is is a threat anytime there's been a threat to our supremacy and technology and that sort of thing we've responded to a fter July 20th 1969 the threat of a Russian moon is gone but most Apollo engineers assume humanity's voyage off our planet has just begun we had a notion that within 20 years we would be landing men on Mars now it didn't turn out that way because we didn't get the promises promised money the budget support that we were promised by the Nixon administration we were mired in Vietnam and we were tremendous social protests against that and that had to be the the first priority of the administration so the Nixon administration greatly reduced the NASA budget after Apollo NASA has proposed building a Space Station a shuttle a moon base and manned missions to Mars all are canceled except the future shuttle which passes Congress by a single vote even the last Apollo flights are cut this was really bitter wine I just felt that this nation was abandoning this moon and this program that we had paid such a heavy price for it was not only the crew paid the price but the controllers paid the price the nation paid the price the toy everything down to lunar receiving land all the good stuff we had just ripped it up and threw it away I just can't believe the country did that and and I don't forgive him ever with Apollo cancelled and the future space shuttle years away NASA puts together the only mission that can afford Skylab a prototype Space Station built from leftover Apollo parts though NASA's future has been cut back to gene Krantz Skylab and every mission to come is critical America must continue in space I always looked at it in a much even broader sense than the Cold War I looked at it as the nature of explorers I looked at it as the spirit of our nation I looked at it as the ability to inspire young people as a tool for forcing our colleges the universities to develop new curriculum is a process by which we would keep the earth and industry going I looked at it in a much broader sense May 14 1973 the empty Skylab is launched astronauts will follow once it reaches orbit its budget may be limited but skylabs plans are ambitious the first astronaut crew will live in Skylab for a month studying the Sun the earth and most of all the human body no one knows if humans can remain healthy in space for months at a time the launch looks good the empty Skylab reaches orbit the astronauts Pete Conrad Paul Weitz and dr. Joe Kerwin are ready to follow then a problem controller John Aaron in the second row is monitoring skylabs powering temperatures his data shows Skylab has almost no electricity and it's getting dangerously hot inside the vehicle you know he got up to you know 150 160 degrees it's in danger of melting such that the pressure will cause it to swell apart a rupture suddenly we were facing a damaged Skylab and we didn't know what the problem was was obvious that we were not going to watch the next day and we had serious problems to work on the astronauts will stay on the ground while Mission Control works the problem the overheating is caused by a missing Sun shield which tore off during launch without it Skylab is baking the same accident tears off of one of skylabs main solar panels debris pins down the other leaving it with almost no solar power to keep Skylab from melding Mission Control have to tilt it away from the Sun but to get even a trickle of power from the one trapped solar wing they have to tilt it toward the Sun and it was this constant battle between these two extremes that we had to solve and fight and get a handle on battling between the extremes of too much and too little son will take incredibly precise maneuvering that job controlling the vehicles course and attitude is normally up to the orbital mechanics and Michigan trolls front row nicknamed the trench in the trench we we're dealing with radar tracking data guidance systems software things like concepts we dealt not with hardware that Hardware skylabs computers instruments power systems is the responsibility of the second row systems both rows report to the flight director in the third row the one in charge the trench begins trying to maneuver Skylab and quickly hits a snag the Skylab turns away from the Sun they lose their tracking data the only way to know its position is for John Aaron call-sign econ to guesstimate based on his temperature and power readings normally since I was a system engineer I didn't have anything to do with controlling the end to the vehicle I mean that was what the trench did well as soon as we pointed off the Sun the trench didn't know where the vehicle was the solution is something completely unheard of econ begins controlling skylabs position and so the would tell flight pitches up 15 more degrees and we need to roll away f12 we'd call out those olders against offshore we kind of look at us and play okay and send the commands up the degree of improvisation was incredible we innovated solutions that were so far out in left-field that it was a leap of faith for one controller to trust another one that they knew what they were doing and that was a cultural shock to the trench when the EECOM started guiding the vehicle and I'll never forget I believe it was the guidance officer to stood up he looked up a couple in the console when he says econ tell me something do you know what the hell you're doing I said just compute the commands and send them up we'll be alright it's not elegant but it works over the next two weeks by trial and error Mission Control is able to keep skylabs power alive without letting it get too hot but there's only so much they can do from the ground if they can't get astronauts up there to free the trapped solar wing American manned space flight is finished and if we couldn't do this the entire program would innit Skylab was over May 1973 working around the clock Mission Control has managed to keep Skylab alive for nearly two weeks now it will be up to astronauts Pete Conrad Paul Weitz and Joe Kerwin to go on-site and perform emergency repairs Skylab was one of the greatest challenges we faced if we did not salvage that mission America's near-term role and space would cease to exist once the astronauts get inside they attack skylabs first problem overheating by deploying an umbrella like sunshade it doesn't look like much but this improvised solution makes all the difference temperatures in Skylab immediately begin to drop but it still has almost no power they have to free the stuck solar panel or skylabs batteries will die in a few weeks to do that the astronauts will have to go outside and somehow from 20 feet away cut a small metal strap that is holding the panel down after scouring the country NASA has equipped the astronauts with a highly sophisticated engineering solution the perfect tool for the job a telephone company tree trimmer it was operated by two ropes and by pulling on the ropes after placing the jaws over the over the the tree branch pull it closed and you did you'd cut the branch so that's about what we had June 7 to 19 73 Pete Conrad and Joe Kerwin begin their spacewalk what NASA calls extra vehicular activity or evie a her one tries to extend the pole and position the jaws of the tree trimmer around the metal strap but in weightlessness it's not so easy every time I would move to get the jaws close to the strap my body would move in reaction Newton's third law of motion took over and Pete didn't have enough leverage to hold me in place it's not looking good and there's nothing Mission Control can do to help then the astronauts notice a nearby u-bolt on the outside of Skylab what if we run the tether from my suit to that you bolt and tighten it enough so that when I push my feet up I've got a three-point stance aha and man I was suddenly as stable as if I was sitting here and five minutes later we had we had the jaws on the strap now the moment of truth Kirwan cuts the strap nothing happens and we've exerted pressure and exerted pressure suddenly the massive panel releases and stars extended there was the sudden release in the two of us when ass over teakettle in outer space only their safety tethers keep them from disappearing into the void Goku and heart rate did reach a high of 150 we pulled ourselves back to the surface of the workshop turned around and saw the most beautiful sight of the mission that solar panel cover fully up and the panels were already starting to come out Mission Control and the astronauts have saved Skylab I think the Skylab repair effort was equivalent to the Apollo 13 effort if not even greater yet many Americans barely notice six weeks earlier the last US combat troops and American POWs were leaving Vietnam and four days into Skylab the Senate Watergate committee was beginning nationally televised hearings out of the public spotlight Mission Control now gets down to the business of running a space station for months at a time they're used to doing short intense missions to the moon Skylab is different it doesn't go anywhere it just orbits and orbits and orbits what a contrast between the initial weeks of Salvage intensity to the humdrum of the routine just as just around and around and around and around and around and around and tomorrow it would be around and do all in the same orbit it wasn't some challenging and interesting thing to come out here and bore holes in space they just sat there and they'd watch the spacecraft go around and around and irad week after week after week gee do I really want to do this the rest of my life the boredom may be new but long hours and being cut off and the outside world have been going on for years and controllers aren't the only ones feeling the effects to get America to the moon controllers wives and children have made sacrifices of their own it was almost like mom was a single parent so we just you know we just lived with the fact that well daddy was never home he was always at work always it worked we owe them something I don't think really recognize the wives just had to take care of the house the kids and whatever business home business you had going his console was called control and I can remember occasionally we would be sitting at the dinner table after he had been simin all day and he just kind of comes in and sits down and we'd say Oh daddy I need such and such or or daddy can't we go and and he would just not even hear it and so finally say control I need to go to such that and it was like oh oh someone call my name there was a lot of Little League games I didn't get to make we all just felt like we had to get it done and the families took the raw end of that we started to lose people and when you got all done with Skylab there was only a core of a lot of the people that were here in Apollo that were left LM used to here go for undocking in February 1974 the third crew leaves Skylab in nine months astronauts have performed over three thousand hours of scientific experiments and returned huge amounts of data including four thousand photos of the earth a hundred and twenty seven thousand of the side and they've proven humans can remain healthy and productive in space for months at a time I think that the measurement of the human body response the long duration flight was probably done better in Skylab than anything before or since we were given the job basically of preparing the United States to build a permanent Space Station we said we think we've done them gene Kranz would like to keep Skylab going we left it in a condition where we believed we could return to it later we had the potential for doing that but skylabs potential will soon be overshadowed by geopolitics and the engineers will find themselves forced to work their next mission oldest enemy spring 1974 skylabs third crew has returned to earth America's first base station now empty continues to orbit there's one more Apollo spacecraft left gene Krantz would like to see it used to send another crew to Skylab basically in the first mission there is one month and then followed by a two month mission followed by three month mission I would have liked to see in a six month or a year long mission we had the potential for doing that Skylab was fully operable but politics intervenes American and Russian leaders are planning the world's first international space flight the apollo-soyuz test project ASTP calls for an American Apollo spacecraft to rendezvous and dock with a Russian Soyuz capsule it's larger purpose is symbolic to prove that after decades of Cold War hostility to enemy's superpowers can put aside differences and work together in space to make it happen American controllers will have to work hand in hand with their oldest enemy in the heart of the evil empire heading up the American team his former flight director Glynn Lunney we had been involved in this cold war competition with the Soviet Union for all my adult life and I had all the images and impressions that were current in America at the time a cold and a forbidding kind of a place threatening intimidating if the Americans are a bit nervous the Russians are downright paranoid KGB was always present we were monitored in our hotel we were monitored in the little cafeteria at the control center I mean if you wish for something you just had to say it out loud and it usually would show up somebody made a comment you know I don't understand why they don't serve water with their meals here at the table and the next day there was a beautiful hand-painted picture on the table with water surveillance notwithstanding Soviet officials make certain their American guests are exposed to Russian culture the Russians would plan something for us usually was going to a church somewhere in Moscow with all these icons when Russians come to the u.s. Americans return the hospitality only the icons are a little different we took them one weekend up to the Huntsville prison rodeo the prisoners over striped suits who I hate indoors all the way up we stopped at a Kentucky Fried Chicken placement nobody ordered up the fried chicken basket July 1975 18 years after Sputnik two superpowers launched to cruise Oh days later on July 17th a Soviet and American spacecraft docking space hatches open and enemies that competed in a space race lasting over a decade shake hands missions made by this first joint effort will be more or less commonplace I think the apollo-soyuz experience was the basis on which maybe we could find a way to ameliorate some of what had been a since World War two almost the long-standing confrontation but from an engineering perspective take the flags off the spacecraft and apollo-soyuz is simply another rendezvous and docking something both countries had perfected years earlier the apollo-soyuz was a unique experiment in political science it certainly was not a unique experience in spaceflight I don't think that from a spaceflight point of view we or the Russians learned a great deal while public attention is focused on diplomacy in space in a different part of the sky nearly forgotten the empty Skylab is still there still circling but America cannot return to Skylab there are no more rockets the decision to use the last Apollo rocket for Apollo Soyuz means Skylab has effectively been abandoned abandoning Skylab to some extent was like abandoning the moon we had derived immense benefit from the work that we had done and again we abandoned this three years after leaving the moon America's manned space program is grounded waiting for a new launch vehicle the space shuttle that is still years away that was about as low a moment as we fed we weren't flying we weren't flying and the shuttle was it was out in front of us but we weren't sure how far out it was a low point in the agency the future shuttles engines heat protective tiles computers will all be revolutionary new designs all unproven until they're built tested and perfected American manned space flight is over horn blowing - tap tap 1981 the last Apollo Rockets have been retired for lack of funding with no vehicle to fly Americans haven't been in space for six years the replacement for those Rockets is the Space Shuttle officially called space transportation system STS a reusable spacecraft with wings it will launch like a rocket and land like an airplane it's job is to carry not just people a large cargo in a giant 60-foot Bay the size was just overwhelming they had a full-scale wooden mock-up of the orbiter and they called it the Messiah because anytime anybody came into the room they'd look and go Jesus Christ to get this enormous vehicle into space and back again will require a host of technological breakthroughs engines must withstand a controlled explosion for eight minutes and unlike previous Rockets shuttle engines must be reusable when the shuttle returns at five miles per second and hits the atmosphere it will heat up to 3,000 degrees protection from that heat comes from 33,000 silica tiles each individually shaped and numbered the problem is gluing them on losing even one tile or opening a gap between tiles could be fatal if we had lost one of these these thermal tiles in the wrong location we'd have a burn through we'd lose the spacecraft returning to earth at 25 times the speed of sound the shuttle will be flown by five redundant computers it's the world's first digital flight control system and it better not freeze up you know you can't do control-alt-delete right in the middle of flight and reboot the thing it's got to work continuously it's gonna work right every time and be right because this place shuttle it's not a vehicle you can manually fly during entry landing will also be new the shuttle will glide back to earth with Moe and jhin's that means there's no second chance to find the runway the trenches calculations have to be perfect you know if we landed within a mile of a ship in Mercury Gemini Apollo that was a huge success well if he that wouldn't work with the space show you have to hit the runway because you don't have go-around capability if you miss the first landing that's a real bad day April 12 1981 sts-1 the first light of the new shuttle Columbia after nearly ten years of development the engines the tiles the computers the runway land all are about to be put to the ultimate test if any part of this system failed the total system failed so the entire United States space program was riding on this first shuttle launch astronauts John Young and Bob Crippen are going to ride the first reusable spacecraft in history sitting in the second row working guidance navigation and control at GNC is rookie controller Rick Fitz STS one will be his first launch the anxiety level among all the team members was very high none of us admitted that we were all the steely-eyed missile men who showed very little emotion but every one of us was scared to death they get a status vital 40 Capcom use that you're gone 40 high-risk is always going to leave a launch face you really don't have an escape system with the shuttle and when the solid Rockets ignite liftoff they're about two minutes you can't shut them down if you're going to go two minutes until the solid rocket boosters burn out and separated two minutes with no abort options Roger Columbia on the ninth ride you're laughing a little bit though you probably be playing I played the moment everyone's waiting for the solid rocket booster separation SRB Sep your golfer has Darby step after SRB Sep I got really emotional I felt like I just won a gold medal at the Olympics and they were playing the star-spangled banner the main engines will burn for six more minutes the empty external tank drops away and finally the shuttle Columbia is safely in orbit Columbia Houston you guys didn't do a good we're going to stay up there for a couple days your goal for on orbit after six years on the ground America is back in space astronauts young and Crippen will remain in orbit for two days checking out the shuttle systems on orbit flight director Chuck Lewis comes on shift one of his first items is a live TV transmission from the shuttle when the TV came on in the room real-time TV came on there was that shot of the tail section there were two or three tile Roger grip we can see that on the homes pod that we're missing and I thought to myself oh crap April 14th 1981 astronauts John Young and Bob Crippen on shuttle Columbia are about to return to Earth video has revealed missing thermal tiles the only protection against the 3,000 degree heat of reentry 30 seconds from LOF reentry begins no one knows what will happen they've got g-forces you know you've done the testing you still worried that something might go wrong and then you go into blackout and pretty soon the radios out during what's called blackout the heat of reentry cuts off radio contact for 20 minutes will the tiles home the fear is that having a gap where a tile used to be would lead to stripping a row of tiles and you needed every one of them if you wanted to enter successfully Mission Control won't know the outcome until blackout ends you get to zero you start column the Capcom calls the crew you wait for a response and everybody's got their fingers crossed the tiles have held now Columbia must glide nearly 4,000 miles to the exact location of the runway at Edwards Air Force Base the trenches calculations better be right how do you make sure you don't run short of energy because you have this glider that's coming back down to a runway from third of the world away you got to hit that 15,000 foot runway and if you don't get it there's no chances of going around you're gonna crash and burn once the runways in sight the flight director gives controllers an unexpected command how to deal with the one thing they don't rehearse human emotion okay and all our personnel then they'll okay I'm sure every one of us following landing is going to have a certain degree of exhilaration so as the nose we all touches down you have 15 seconds to vent that emotion and then I will expect this room become quiet and keep it that way for another 45 minutes bring get ready for exhilaration welcome off so I can get a beautiful by the corners to stop to see that everything did work as planned it was just a total rush to me the payoff was seeing John young and Crippen get on a spacecraft and then just go jumping around examining the aircraft I mean it was an absolute joy he was a hell of a technical achievement in one that we've been working on for a long long time those pretty emotions after six years stuck on the ground America's finally back in space the shuttle begins revolutionising space flight a fleet of four orbiters will carry satellites to orbit conduct science experiments repair broken satellites and for the first time in history bring large cargo back from space the shuttle also revolutionizes the sociology of space astronauts will no longer be just military test pilots some mission specialists will be responsible not for flying the vehicle but pretending to payloads and experiments on the ground the shuttle changes Mission Control as well bringing a new wave of engineers into the control center unlike Gene Kranz pioneering generation these young controllers won't be starting from scratch I was aware of Mission Control from the get-go like everybody else you know my older brother and I first learned to count backwards from ten to zero which is absolutely true and I'm sure we drove our folks nuts because we used to count down to everything you know time to get in the car time to go take a bath this is gonna sound absolutely ridiculous but I very much wanted to be a Starfleet officer and and I think be closest to that profession in this century is actually a mission controller I read every newspaper article every life and magazine article I could find and it's funny because I remember a lot of the names and reading the reports of the press conferences a flight director Gene Kranz said thus and such at the interview and I have to say as much as I admire and respect the astronauts being in Mission Control was the place to be for new controllers there's a lot to master schematics lights switches but they're not the only ones that have to adjust the world outside the control center has been changing and the new engineers bring with them signs of the times there was a little culture clash with the new guys coming in and a little bit longer hair you've seen the pictures of the guys on Apollo 11 Apollo 13 all the white shirts the skinny ties there were just a few of us that came in in the 70s that didn't quite fit that mold evolving fashions and hairstyles are just the beginning all their engineers are about to find out the mold for controllers isn't just changing it's being shattered I'll never forget going into a mission rulers release and this young lady got up and she was arguing the mission rule and I thought she sounds like a fine controller she was taking the flight controller view of everything found out thoughts crossed across is she a flight controller and he said yeah and I look back at it you know I thought well I'll be my desk was aimed at the window so my back was to the door and I'd look around and there would be some of the men looking around the doorway and they go is that one of them meaning a female engineer when I came here there weren't in flight control very many women at all it was the only one and I believe the first one in the section propulsion section well the first thing they had to put women's rooms in this building and they did it so subtly the first day they did I walked into what the changes in Mission Control are echoed in the astronaut corps as well in June 1983 Sally Ride becomes the first American woman to fly into space in August Guion Bluford the first african-american as shuttle flights continued the most complex flying machine ever built is proving its potential the shuttle is so consistently successful that space flight is beginning to seem routine and safe I always felt in the shuttle that we had arrived kind of where commercial aviation arrived that that there were it was now time that we were gonna put a pilot in the front that didn't have parachute and passengers in the back that didn't have a parachute and you can't trust the system to work in June 1984 NASA announces the teacher and space program for the first time an ordinary citizen will get a ride in space I am so excited to be here New Hampshire teacher Christa McAuliffe will fly the second orbiter to join the shuttle fleet challenger January 28 1986 after several postponements Challenger is go for launch we have January 28 1986 space shuttle Challenger is a few hours away from launch weather has been unusually cold unknown to Mission Control and Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama and Morton Thiokol builder of the solid rocket boosters some engineers are concerned they fear the cold may cause a ring seals than the SRB joints to fail but there's no hard evidence they decide to go ahead with the launch pilot mike smith follows i would consolidate you in faith flight director j green an Apollo veteran starts his shift I came in and took over and I never thought that there was a concern anywhere that the marshal systems-level they have a nice team they cleared us the launch countdown was nominal hardware looked good everything look of gold brain no one realizes it but at the moment of ignition both a rings in the right SRB fail a puff of black smoke later seen on high-speed film reveals hot combustion gases blowing through the scene we launched everything looked good the SRBs will burn for two minutes gene Kranz now director of mission operations is sitting in the fourth row mentally now my clock is running because after two minutes the Mission Control team and the astronauts start to have escaped actions but prior to that time there is no escape it is the beginning throttling down now at 94% the leak in the SRB joint is getting worse at 58 seconds a small flame breaks through we got to the throttle down throttle up call and I was now seconds away from feeling this this burden being released from you 64 seconds the flame no one sees begins burning through the skin of the external fuel tank holding liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen for the main engines still looking good engines came up the Capcom responded you're going throttle up challenger go at throttle up it was a TV about right over there and we've been trained watch the data don't watch the TV I saw just a flicker of light and I glanced over there momentarily it was out of my line of sight these guys picked it up it was horror plane you see we've had negative conduct loss apparently copy okay all operators watch data carefully and I look over just see their faces then I looked over there at the TV Ranbir was the to smoke column y'all have seen as much as we have I looked at J and this the look on his face it was something that you see only a few times in your life flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation obviously a major malfunction slight righto RSL reports vehicle exploded copy signed uncle unity reports for recovery forces stay well just my hora pain just wonder if you could do something it could have done something to a forced Donnelly and this horror you know grips you it it becomes almost unimaginable and your ability to live with it but that is our job to live with the risk of our business in some days it's bad this is the nature of people who hold life's in their hands all of the seven-person crew are gone six astronauts and new hampshire school teacher Christa McAuliffe as the disaster replays over and over on television Mission Control is already taking the first step to learn what happened okay everybody stay off the telephones make sure you maintain all your data start pulling it together and it was data collection preservation of data and then it was sneaked out of the building four controllers perhaps the hardest part of Challenger is their powerlessness we come together today to mourn the loss of seven brave Americans to share the grief over time through the simulations we train ourselves that there is nothing that can happen that we can't solve and if a problem comes up that will affect the shuttle or the safety of the crew the lives of the crew we will fix that and here was the case and Challenger where a problem happened that we could not fix several investigations follow the report of a presidential commission released four months after the accident in June 1986 faults NASA for ignoring years of warning signs that the o-rings and the SRB joint were not reliable for the next two and a half years America's space program is grounded while the SRB joint is redesigned some critics urge an end to manned space flight but mission controllers remain convinced that the benefits outweigh the risk I think we all recognized the importance of recovering from that accident resolving the problems and moving on there's a great deal of courage in the people here in this program we don't do this because of the laurels from the public which have faded since the Apollo days we do this because of a belief in what we do this is the process of adventures this is the process of exploration this is the process of people who are willing to accept risk we felt it essential to provide the inspiration for the students and our colleges and universities to develop the technologies we needed for the future we felt it essential to our nation to remain explorers September 29 1988 two and a half years after the Challenger disaster the shuttle discovery returns to flight beginning a five-year period of shuttle successes over the next 32 missions shuttles release communications and defense satellites carry out science experiments launch probes to Venus Jupiter and the Sun milestone after milestone success after success but when the 1.5 billion dollar Hubble Space Telescope is found to be defective NASA once again finds itself under criticism the Hubble is supposed to deliver views of the universe with unprecedented clarity instead because of a flaw in its mirror the images it sends back are out-of-focus useless NASA begins planning a daring mission to service and repair the Hubble but no one is certain they can pull it off lead flight director will be Milt Heflin and Heflin is feeling the pressure NASA was taking lots of heat the servicing mission was the next act on stage and yes there was a tremendous amount of nervousness well ok NASA are you gonna are you gonna fix it can you do it December 2nd 1993 the shuttle Endeavour departs for the Hubble it's not clear if the repair is even possible but it is clear NASA's future is once again on the line December the second 1993 the Shuttle Endeavor is on a mission to repair the 1.5 billion dollar Hubble Space Telescope the stakes are high not only the Hubble but the future of NASA itself may well be riding on the outcome we had deployed what was to be the crown jewel of astronomy and we had an aberration in the lens that would not produce the detail that basically had been advertised so there was incredible pressure upon NASA it will be one of the most difficult and complicated missions ever attempted the Hubble is five stories tall the size of a small office building moving 17,000 miles an hour 370 miles above the earth installing a corrective lens is only part of the job lead flight director for the mission is Milt Heflin we also had solar arrays that needed to be replaced this is basically ripping the wings off of this telescope and putting new ones on we also had some rate gyros that failed had to be replaced some power distribution hardware so we had plenty of work to do it will take five days of back-to-back EVs 35 hours of spacewalks never before have astronauts attempted this much work out in space every minute is planned and choreographed they won't have a second to waste keep an eye on the doors the first Evi starts well in two hours astronaut story Musgrave manages to replace the defective gyros I think it just spun up but we have six pin gyros on the telescope there we go then a problem at the bottom access doors to the gyros won't close Kathlyn doesn't want to set back on the very first Evo this was gonna be a race for for several days and it was the important that we got out of the starting blocks and got to that first term ahead of the game astronaut Musgrave suggests using a tool called a come-along to force the door shut but engineers on the ground disagree they're nervous about damage milled Heflin has scores of hubble experts on the ground giving him one opinion an astronaut in space giving him another and no way to know who's right all the analysts look at data but you get to the flight director and he or she has very little real data that they look at their data source are all these people in the front room that report status and information to them it is a scary proposition to sit on consoles of flight director and realized I'm gonna make the decisions and recognize that in many cases we will not have enough data to know that we're making the right decision and even in that case you still have to make a decision and take some action there's grain and the flight directors job is to take that gray and then use his judgment as to whether you're either go or no go and you have to live with this decision everyone waits for heflin's call come peanut Capcom Jory - go ahead he decides to let Musgrave try it I had a great deal of trust in story Musgrave he treated that Hubble Space Telescope like a child let's trust what what story wants to do let's let him go do that I think we got the door closed good work guys heflin's decision to take the risk has been critical we're hip who made that first turn and we are in the lead over the next four days of high-pressure spacewalks astronauts discard the old solar arrays and deploy new ones they replace the wide field planetary camera and they install coastal the corrective lens that will refocus the light from Hubble's flawed mirror finally they jettison Hubble releasing it into its own orbit and return to Earth now the world waits to see if the repair will work a week later the answer as Hubble starts returning its first clear pictures breathtaking views of our universe emerge over the years that follow the Hubble's images magnificent mysterious spiritual strike a chord with people everywhere when I see the Hubble photos I recognize how vast this universe is how finite we are and how infinite this world is around us my goodness gracious would you look at what is there I mean we on earth are arrogant enough to think that we're hit you know that that's hit hubbell I think is making a statement saying that you're not it while the Hubble repair mission is a new beginning for the Space Telescope it marks the end of an era in Mission Control the last time Gene Kranz sits at a console in this room coming into the control room that day was the beginning of not being part of this process so that was the sad part but the good part was when I left that room that day I saw the culture that had been established within this room I saw the legacy of leadership I saw the legacy of people willing to step up to risk make decisions and then get on with it and now it's time to hand over fully and completely to this next generation and I felt good I felt this is what I was here for as Jean Krantz leaves for the last time the institution he helped build is on the verge of radical change the young generation of engineers is about to face challenges and crises as demanding as any in the history of Mission Control December 1993 as Gina Krantz leaves Mission Control for the last time NASA is on the brink of a new era joining with Russia as well as Japan Canada and Europe to build ISS the International Space Station Space Station is a massive venture there has never been a construction project of this magnitude ever attempted in space in the history of mankind on this planet ISS will consist of multiple modules built on earth assembled together in space to fly this new vehicle four years at a time Mission Control will have to expand our mission was changing to some degree we now had to simultaneously control shuttle missions and station missions and the physical architecture of of the systems in this building just didn't support doing that so we had to upgrade to a newer capability the old Houston control center in used since 1965 will be retired a new addition is built to hold three new flight control rooms F CRS or thicker z' two for shovel and one for ISS when put into operation in 1995 the combined processing power and backup capacity makes the new Mission Control Center one of the most advanced computer networks in the world three years later in November in 1998 the first ISS module is launched over the next two years eleven others are added each is built by different nations and contractors yet in space they must fit and work together perfectly as far as a technical accomplishment it probably far surpasses anything we've done before in November 2000 the first crew expedition one begins living aboard the International Space Station for mission controllers flying ISS is a new experience on the shuttle astronauts control much of the vehicles operations but operating the station is largely up to Mission Control station controller Holly ridings will never forget sending her first command Wow you know I get to send commands to a vehicle you know several hundred nautical miles up in space going around the earth every 90 minutes I mean that is just amazing and and all I did the time was turn on a heater but at the time it was you know I just turned on a heater and you're just completely you know in awe again of what you are capable of it really was amazing by January 2003 ISS is on sixth Peru the structure is nearly half complete shuttle flights are now devoted almost entirely to building and supporting station but there is one more non ISS shuttle mission left sts-107 a science flight to be flown by the shuttle Columbia yeah booster ignition space shuttle Columbia on January 16th 2003 Columbia lifts off during ascent a briefcase sized chunk of styrofoam insulation blows off the external fuel tank and strikes the shuttle apparently somewhere on the left side a foam strikes are nothing new we've had close to 9,000 impacts on the vehicle throughout the program and we were able to land with all of them and I think there's only one maybe two that required a structural repair a small amount of damage on the vehicle was a maintenance issue but that it didn't seem to threaten the survivability of the vehicle and the performance of the tile in protecting the vehicle from heat Columbia spends 16 days in space and carries out over 70 different science experiments February 1st 2003 after a perfect mission Columbia begins reentry flight director on shift is Leroy Cain I felt very good about the prospects of being able to land that day I was thinking about the things that I always think about worrying really more accurately about the things that I always worry about 1/nth really need a Jeff cling is on the mechanical system console callsign max it was a very typical entry sort of day until we started losing some sensors and that we lost one which got our attention and within seconds a second one and then two more flight backs max that's why I have just lost four separate temperature transducers on the left side of the vehicle hydraulic return temperatures it was not anything to be concerned with because we've had sensors go off before copy look to be an instrumentation problem quite frankly for hide return temps okay is there anything common to him as Jeff claimed works his problem Katy Rogers at the econ console watches other temperature indicators part of my responsibility are these sensors underneath the tile on the skin of the vehicle and as I pulled up that display I noticed that four of the two of the temperatures were off-scale low which is sort of an unpowered state Jeff reported some more instrumentation that he had lost I look back at the display and I had two more parameters going off scale oh I thought well this is unusual and flighty come become I've got four temperature sensors on the bond line data that are all CLO we just couldn't come up with any single point failure that would explain all of the indications that we were seeing no commonality no commonality something's going on that we don't understand then Mission Control loses all communication with Columbia Columbia Houston danger February 1st 2003 space shuttle Columbia sorry entering the Earth's atmosphere at 17,000 miles an hour its exterior is heating to 3000 degrees some sensors have stopped sending data it could be nothing but it's where those centers are located they're starting to worry Mission Control something's going on that we don't understand I'm standing over here came over next to Ron and Ralph was sittin in that chair and I said Ralph that's the left wing that was the wing that the foam hit where is that instrumentation located located in the a part of the left wing I began to think about the fact that this was all happening in the left wing in fact it that we had debris striking and probably at that point is when I began to worry about the possibility of having hot gas in the wing then Mission Control loses communication with Columbia Columbia Houston comm check Columbia Houston UHF comm check I didn't I didn't expect this bad overhead on calm by now Columbia should be showing up on radar final one you expecting Trekkie one minute ago flight all mission control knows they know through data the one thing their screens don't show is a visual picture of the outside world they have no idea what people are seeing in the skies over Texas until they get a phone call one of our colleagues from our office had called in and said they saw multiple multiple objects in the path of where Columbia should have been GC flight GC plane why'd you say lock the doors happy there's a lot of symbolic meaning to that GC locked the door and when he made the call he did it twice very quickly GC flight TC fly lock the doors you know part of me was wanting to transition into this sort of this angry mode of you know by golly we're gonna find out what happened no matter what it takes there's a whole list of data collection items that we need to make sure we log through airliners carry voice and data recorders to tell what happened in the event of an accident in Space Flight Mission Control itself is a giant data recorder each controller each console records one piece of the story Leroy Cain has just taken the first step in what will become a Columbia accident investigation a massive search effort being coordinated by different government agencies and started the process that begins that day quickly zeroes in on the phone strike apparently during asset the small piece of styrofoam damaged the leading edge of the left wing during reentry superhot gas penetrates inside the wind which eventually breaks off causing Columbia to disintegrate the report of the Columbia accident investigation board released in August 2003 finds that foam strikes were tolerated for years because they never did major damage schedule pressure budget constraints and work force reductions also contributed to a breakdown in safety for the next two and a half years NASA works to improve the insulation on the external tank and develop ways to inspect and repair shuttle surfaces in space July 26 2005 shuttle Discovery is about to return to flight to detect any debris strike the launches photographed by over a hundred cameras on the ground mounted in chase planes and on the vehicle itself approaching the International Space Station ISS commander Eileen Collins performs a backflip maneuver allowing the station crew to take additional photos of Discovery's underside never before has anyone seen such detailed views of the vehicle in flight my heart's been in my throat all mornings a great day and to think that here we are today with Americans back in flight on an American vehicle it's just a tremendous step but within days analysis of a photography reveals the phone problem that destroyed Columbia has not been completely eliminated we've had a problem there was a very large piece of foam and that is clearly unacceptable and clearly has to go be fixed discovery hinted on 290 thankfully none of the foam hits on discovery are critical and the Mission Continues astronauts do spacewalks to repair the station and deliver 16 tons of supplies like a frigerator Brendon on the last spacewalk astronaut Steve Robinson removes two pieces of loose gap filler between the tiles on Discovery's underside it's the first in space repair of shuttle surfaces in history you guys did a great job congratulation on August 19 discovery returns to earth the most closely watched shuttle mission in decades has successfully resupplied the station and tested and proven new methods for inspecting and repairing shuttle surfaces but it has also made clear that while foam strikes have been reduced by over 80 percent there is still more work to do nor can Discovery's flight hide the larger fact that America is still at a crossroads in space searching for a direction a vision we haven't had since Apollo time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth it is time for America to take the next steps today I announced a new plan to explore space and extend a human presence across our solar system President Bush has called for a new exploration initiative returning to the moon and going on to Mars but other presents have announced similar plans that never came true tonight I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade for the new century a permanent lunar base and we're going back to the moon back to the future and this time back to stay what originally inspired project Apollo in the 1960s was not exploration but competition a threat to national security will it take a new competitor a fear of being overshadowed or left behind to reinvigorate America's manned space program China watch China very carefully if China gets very aggressive in space and they put people in orbit and then it maybe you want to go on somewhere else we'd better be ready if you're the technological leaders then you're going to be the economic leaders this nation turns out about sixty thousand engineers a year China and Japan turned out about what half a million the principle reason I believe we must continue to be explorers is so we can inspire the young people of our nation to study engineering math and science because without engineers mathematicians and scientists we will be incapable of providing the technologies we need to keep the economic engine of our country working space may also hold new sources of energy NASA and others have already studied the possibility of putting solar collectors on the moon and microwaving energy back to earth there's been studies done that says that that is feasible would it require major infrastructure to set up on the moon yes would it take major transportation capabilities back in front forth moon yes but it is a response to the national security implications of the depleting energy supplies in the world whatever the rewards of space to fatal accidents in 20 years remind us there will be risks it's been said many times that it's safer to do space exploration with robots well it may be safer but ultimately for human beings to get the benefit of space exploration human beings have to go in space it is not gonna be easy people make the mistake of thinking that just because we've flown the space shuttle over a hundred times that it is easy it is not easy it will never be easy there is no such thing is there a risk when it goes into space it's like a ship the only safe place for a ship with zero risk is in the harbor but what good is a ship if it's in the harbor I'm a ship's were made to sail in the end perhaps taking the risk venturing off our planet is simply an inescapable part of who we are a technical piece of what we do is is so amazing that I think people forget sometimes that one of the reasons we're doing this is the human aspect of it I mean why do you go to space the answer almost always is just the search for what's out there this is human nature it's and their souls to wanna go explore I mean look at this country this country exists because the Europeans got restless and they were looking for more what else is out there what else is over the horizon so let's keep up that tradition let's keep pushing the frontier out not just because it's there but because that's how we find things that end up changing humanity the worst thing that we can do is just to walk away and in quit and if we do quit flying humans in space then we haven't learned a thing from the Columbia accident we need to continue we need to continue to explore and that that's that's the best legacy that we can have one thing is certain no matter what the vision for America's future in space there is one group of people who will be there leading the way the men and women of Mission Control you"
moonlanding,"What are the odds of life on planets orbiting nearby stars? Scientists, wielding sensitive new telescopes and ""big data"" tools, have detected planets around thousands of stars; some Sun-like and some very different from our star. Many newly discovered ""exoplanets"" lie in ""habitable zones,"" where liquid water may support the chemistry that enables biology. How will astronomers discover if we have company in the cosmos...and where they live?

radio telescope witnessed a repetitive signal it's radiating from the direction of the Virgo constellation it has all the characteristics of intelligence it seems to be coming from a small red dwarf star named Ross 1:28 and it's just 11 light-years away one of our nearest cosmic neighbors 50 300 kilometers to the south on a Chilean mountaintop the 3.6 meter less iya Observatory is completing more than a decade of monitoring that same star in those data a stunning detection there is an earth-sized planet orbiting ross 128 and it resides in the habitable zone where life sustained by liquid water is possible now wielding sensitive new instruments planet hunters are suddenly finding thousands of new worlds all over the sky but have any of them sprung to life or are we on earth loan orphans of the universe look up at the night sky hit any star according to astronomers it probably has several planets in orbit around it and there are many more stars out there and BPI the most common star type in the universe is the red dwarf also known as the Class M star they're hard to see small lightweight cool and faint but these conditions actually make it easier to find exoplanets orbiting around them because red dwarfs are petite the wobbling motion caused by their planets gravitationally tugging on them is larger so it's simpler for instruments to detect because they're low in mass the planet's orbit close in there years go by in just a few days so it's easier to see the wobble pattern repeating and passes across the face of the star called transits happen much more often because they're cool and faint there's less glare so planets are plainer to perceive Proxima Centauri our stellar next-door neighbor is just such a red dwarf it's puny just 12% the mass of the Sun and less than 14% is big it's only about 1% is bright so it's relatively cool only about 3,000 Kelvin our Sun is nearly 6,000 Kelvin and after extensively studying the star for more than 16 years astronomers have confirmed at least one small planet Brosnan Proxima Centauri be it's at least 1.3 times more massive than Earth probably dense and rocky like our world which would make it about 10% bigger it orbits its parent star once in a little more than 11 days revolving at the distance where water could be liquid as well as solid and gas just like Earth but there's a problem with that star like many red dwarfs Proxima Centauri has a stormy temperament large flares blasting x-rays bathing its system of worlds in deadly radiation eroding away any life supporting atmospheres they may have and there are problems with that newly found planet although it's in the so called Goldilocks zone Proxima B orbits only 7.2 million kilometers from the source of that radiation that's 21 times closer to its star than we are 2 hours because Proxima B doesn't rotate it may have no magnetic field nothing to ward off the onslaught of lethal energy to anyone standing on the surface of that world the irate red star would look ten times larger than our Sun does to us more concerns the planet doesn't tilt like ours and its orbit seems to be nearly circular which means it doesn't have seasons Earth's changing climate and relatively rapid rotation of day into night likely stimulates the continual evolution of life próxima B is much less dynamic it's probably in tidal lock with its star like our moon it always shows its parent body the same face so it may have a warm day side which would bear the brunt of the flares coming off the star and a cold frozen night side the view from that night side would be dominated by two dazzling stars Alpha Centauri a and B forming a triple system with Proxima each tens of times brighter than any stars in the night skies of Earth but there may be no one there to see them if you go a little further out from earth the news gets better Ross 1:28 only 11 light-years from us is one of the quietest red dwarfs known it discharges hazardous radiation much less often than its sister M stars the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher or harps has been looking at Ross 1:28 coming through ten years of data astronomers recently confirmed a rocky planet gliding along in the stars temperate zone dubbed Ross 1:28 be the small dense planet looks to be one point 35 times the mass of Earth much like Proxima B and similar to the planet at Proxima Ross 128 B orbits about 20 times closer to its calm and cool star than does earth to our hotter Sun it's year is just nine point nine days long this planet may offer the closest most comfortable environment of any exoplanet found so far but that's not conclusively proven the Ross world maybe more like Venus holding a high-pressure atmosphere that's too hot for life and what about that intriguing Arecibo radio signal the celebrated Green Bank telescope in West Virginia and the SETI Institute s' Allen telescope array in Northern California both took a long hard look the repeat signal wasn't seen again researchers best guess is that was most likely a reflection of pulses from one or more communication satellites in geostationary orbit around Earth but though there's no proof of intelligence astrobiologists remain enthusiastic this they say is the right kind of place to look for life small red M dwarfs live hundreds of times longer than sun-like stars if primitive life can get a toehold on a world near one there's a plenty of time for evolution to learn to cope with harsh conditions red dwarfs are opening up new possibilities of finding habitable worlds just when planet discoveries around more familiar stars seem to be shutting them down scientists will invent different schemes for detecting alien planets most successful so far at least in terms of raw numbers is two tasks a Space Telescope with persistently staring at a rich patch of stars to engine start one zero and liftoff of the Delta 2 rocket with Kepler on a search for planets in a Sun way like our own launched in 2009 the remarkable Kepler mission watches for the slight dimming of a star when a planet sails across its space along the line of sight between the telescope and the target star Kepler astronomers and citizen scientists have spotted several thousand new planets using this transit technique thousands more are waiting to be confirmed by seeing them pass a second or third time establishing the planets orbital period so the longer humanity looks the more worlds will probably see in slower wider orbits more distant from their Suns the searches to date have mostly netted large diameter planets most of them very close to their stars big world's transiting often are beginning to divulge the secrets of their atmospheres astronomers are practicing on these worlds learning to spot molecules like methane nitrogen carbon dioxide water and oxygen which could be products of active life so-called biomarkers a surprising number of these globes are truly gigantic super Jupiter's between eight and fourteen times heavier than our own Earth and Venus are up to a thousand times smaller and 2,500 times lighter in weight altogether much more difficult to spot some planets lead truly bizarre lives like this extra hot gas giant HD 1897 33 B it orbits so close to its turbulent star that periodic flares tear off large chunks of its atmosphere researchers call this a torch orbit NASA Swift satellite and the Hubble Space Telescope watched as the planet temporarily grew a tail like a comet big as it is over millions of years this huge world will erode away some worlds like scorpion 1b inhabit multiple star systems feeling the complex gravitational interactions of two three or more massive bodies and this one age IP 1304 t4b is an immigrant planet it came in with its parent star from outside our galaxy this dramatic diversity among exoplanets as astronomers scratching their heads but planet hunters believe they've barely scratched the surface of the skies hidden treasures one quick way to tell if a planet might be earth-like is to check the color of the light bouncing off of it if you look in a color space earth sits off on its own a lone wolf away from its solar system siblings some researchers rate worlds with an earth similarity index the ESI a number ranging from zero nothing like earth to one exactly like earth to qualify as a true twin to ours it's not enough for a planet to be the same mass or the same size or even in the habitable zone in 2007 the harpes team at La SIA picked up the first evidence of a planet in the habitable zone of its star a red dwarf named Gliese 581 six times more massive than Earth and rotating so slowly it's days perhaps seventy of our days long Gliese 581d made globally warm itself with greenhouse gases so it could be an ocean planet the first one spotted if so it probably began as an ice giant further out in the system kepler-22b was the first exoplanet that mission scientists found in the temperate zone of a star like ours that star is just slightly smaller than ours but the planet is bigger about two times Earth's diameter the transit method isn't very good at pinning down planetary masses so we don't yet know how it weighs in compared to earth researchers speculate it may be a Waterworld a deep global ocean clinging to a massive rocky core 22 light-years out in another direction gliese 667cc swings round a cool red m-dwarf in just 28 days at that distance the star looks three times wider than our Sun does to us and you'd see two other prominent lights in that sky the star has two nearby sisters the planet is massive maybe five times Earth's mass standing on its surface if it has one you'd weigh one and a half times what you do at home but it's possible you'd feel right at home in other ways the Lisa 667cc could be habitable 10% larger than our planet kepler 186f lives just within the outer edge of its stars Goldilocks own that star is a red dwarf about 500 light-years distance for larger hot and presumably lifeless planets ride closer into the dwarf 186f is roughly earth sized perhaps just 11% larger but it's probably colder than Mars in 2013 a pair of planets surfaced in the Kepler data 62e and 62f circle their cool star in orbits where plenty of water could flow the inner one is likely a totally wet world the outer a super-earth one and a half times our size could be cooler and drier now imagine a cloudy world where you wait at least twice what you do on earth kepler 452b sometimes called Earth's cousin is probably rocky like us and 1.6 times our size but it may be up to 5 times more massive 1,400 light-years from us it orbits a g-type star very much like our Sun it's 20 percent brighter but the planet rides a bit further out from its star the kepler 452b liyan and a half years older than ours evolution has had more time to work it was long thought that the most likely place for life would be an earth-like planet circling a sun-like star but in 2017 a system full of surprises came to light a tiny star not much bigger than Jupiter hosting seven rocky planets all about the same size and mass as Earth the Trappist one planetary system takes its name from the project that discovered it transiting planets and planetesimals small telescopes it's a pair of surprisingly petite robotic scopes they're perched on a Chilean mountain but controlled from Belgium NASA's Spitzer infrared Space Telescope helped confirm the find when a star isn't bright a small earth sized world transiting across its surface makes a big difference a proportionally larger drop in the light curve 40 light years out the ultra-cool dwarf named Trappist 1a glows a deep red it's just 11% the diameter of our parent star so it puts out merely 5/100 the sun's light though it's dim the dwarf provides more than enough energy to set up a habitable zone and at least three of the newly discovered planets orbit within it Trappist 1f is likely the best positioned for life the red Sun in its sky would look larger than ours does to us but less than 100 as bright it could be warm there though like tussling siblings seven world so near to one another probably jostle one another's orbits they try to keep in resonance their orbital periods pulled into hole number relationships but those gravitational tugs could power up tight keeping these worlds warm mixing the chemistry's that lead to life the Trappist one system has had a long time to brew the little star could be more than twice as old as our Sun and it could live at least ten times longer like Ross 1:28 Trappist one is a quiet dwarf it's ultraviolet radiation wouldn't strip the atmospheres of the planets in its habitable zone for perhaps 15 billion years the search for nearby worlds that may be like our own is accelerating large arrays of millimetre and submillimetre wavelength dish antennas like this one in the hive cold Atacama Desert are revealing how baby planets grow within the dust disks of young stars the giant Magellan telescope at loss arena Chile with a segmented primary mirror twenty four and a half metres across and the extremely large telescope also in Chile but at Cerro Amazonas with its nearly 40 meter wide aperture and laser guided adaptive optics will try to take direct images of exoplanets at least five times sharper than the Hubble Space Telescope their monster mirrors take years to cast cool and polish above Earth's atmosphere nasa's transiting exoplanet survey satellite tests will search all over the sky looking at the brightest and nearest stars at least 200,000 of them with the objective of spotting earth sized and super earth sized planets europe's plateau satellite will investigate as well new space-based observatories like the James Webb Space Telescope and the wide field Infrared Survey telescope should be able to identify the composition of many exoplanets atmospheres they'll look for telltale signs of biology the exhalations of life in the gases around these worlds like a small bird flying near the landing lights of a large airplane planets moving near stars are tough to see astronomers are now perfecting devices called coronagraphs which simulate the effect of an eclipse blocking out the glare of nearby stars to reveal planets they may host if an alien world is young and bright enough and far enough away from its star such instrumentation can directly image it these sensitive detectors may be able to make out what's in the atmospheres of the nearby habitable zone dwelling earth-sized worlds like Ross 128 B Proxima B and the Trappist one planets evolution of biology on earth dramatically changed our planet's atmosphere setting up a feedback loop making conditions even more hospitable to life with a similar level of technology to our own astronomers on any of those alien planets could tell that we are a living world on the scale of human distances even the closest stars are almost unimaginably far away humanity's farthest rocket-powered probes are only now just leaving the solar system after four decades but a bold plan to dispatch a fleet of tiny low-mass nanoprobes across the interstellar abyss due Proxima Centauri has just been launched driven by a constant coherent column of light from a square kilometer phased array of 10 kilowatt lasers together pumping out about a hundred gigawatts the swarm of sales would be propelled outward from earth fast enough to fly by the nearest star system in about 20 years aboard each light sail rides a tiny package of science instruments including cameras plus communications module a miniscule radioisotope battery and a photon thruster for maneuvering all weighing no more than a few grams they're called star chips a thousand such craft would be deployed at a time it's a long way to travel and plenty can go wrong including impacts of interstellar dust cosmic rays and atoms of hydrogen commands could be sent as modulating information on the power beam and findings would be uplink to earth by a compact laser using the sail area as an antenna this audacious concept its first phase privately-funded could return close-up images and sensor data of Proxima Centauri be the first mission to an exoplanet in the last few years astronomers have had to completely change the way they think about worlds around other stars once assumed to be rare exoplanets turn out to be extremely common small dense worlds like ours orbiting in the habitable zones of stars are showing up more often in astronomical searches unexpected lakes and seas in our own solar system suggest that supportive conditions exist in astonishing locations ultra cool dwarf stars may actually be better at building oceans on their planets than stars like our Sun ultraviolet light from flaring dwarf stars could stimulate the complex chemistry needed to jumpstart biology life may spring up in places that are nothing like our planet and to them we may look like the surprising outlier but we evolved on earth will we ever find any other world as beautiful"

Milky Way our Sun is a third-generation star starting from gaseous clouds and dense nebulae containing many heavy elements it condensed under the inexorable pressure of gravity until it was hot and dense enough to experience nuclear fusion at its core as stars go our Sun is an average yellow star but it is so massive that it contains ninety-nine point eight percent of all the mass in the solar system its radiant energy supports almost all life on Earth and it drives Earth's climate and weather it is almost nine hundred thousand miles in diameter it has a core temperature of about 15 million degrees and its surface temperature of about 6,000 degrees the Sun will be fairly stable over the next five billion years at which time it will enter its red giant phase it will expand enormous ly so that its outer layers will reach the current orbit of Earth giving it a diameter of almost 200 million miles after that it will live a few billion more years as a white dwarf mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system it is only about three thousand miles in diameter and has a surface that is pockmarked with craters like our own moon there's the innermost planet and has an elliptical orbit that takes it within twenty-eight million miles of the Sun at its closest approach and out to 43 million miles at its most distant it takes Mercury 88 days to orbit the Sun and figure this out sports fans although it rotates once every 59 days the day on Mercury is a hundred and seventy-six Earth days long oh it doesn't really have a tail we added the one in the video to make it easier to see and to show its orbit and although the scale is correct for the size of the Sun relative to Mercury's orbit we are showing the planet a hundred times larger than it would be if it were to scale as well except for the Sun in the moon venus is the brightest object in the sky and since it is closer to the Sun than we are it shows phases like the moon shrouded in permanent clouds Venus rotates on its axis every 243 days and it rotates backwards from the other planets it is only slightly smaller than the earth and it orbits the Sun every 225 days at a mean distance of 67 million miles but its surface is terribly inhospitable the atmospheric pressure at the surface is 92 times that of the earth similar to the pressure a half a mile down underwater its temperature is a bombing 900 degrees Fahrenheit all in all not a good vacation spot our earth is eight thousand miles in diameter and rotates on its axis causing sunrise every day it is the largest of all the planets that have a solid surface and it possesses an unusually large moon or planet of its size since the moon circles the earth we think of the moon's motion as circular but since the Earth Moon system revolves around the Sun at about 65,000 miles per hour the moon's motion in the solar system isn't much different from our own at 93 million miles from the Sun the earth is a third inter most planet and is the only place in the solar system that we know of that has liquid water Mars is the planet most similar to Earth in terms of habitat although smaller than Earth and Venus it has a thin atmosphere and probably had liquid water on its surface in the past this attracts our interest and has prompted us to send a plethora of probes it has two orbiting irregular shaped rocks graciously called moons which are probably captured asteroids a day on Mars lasts about 24 hours very comparable to our own the volcano called Olympus Mons or Mount Olympus is the highest known mountain in the solar system it is an extinct volcano and is over three times the height of Mount Everest Mars is a fourth planet from the Sun and completes its orbit every two earth years jupiter is huge if it had only been a little larger it could have become a brown dwarf star circling our Sun it is a gas giant and has no solid surface its atmosphere forms bands of poisonous clouds that circle the planet in opposite direction the giant red spot is a huge storm that has been raging for hundreds of years four of its many moons are so large that Galileo spotted them with his primitive telescope in 1610 in addition to moons all the gas giants have rings but Jupiter's rings are so faint they are not visible the fifth planet out Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 480 million miles and takes almost 12 years for one complete circuit notice the large separation between the orbits of Jupiter and Mars this is the realm of the asteroid belt it is the debris of a planet that failed to form because of Jupiter's gravitational influence Saturn is the second largest of the planets only Jupiter is larger like all the gas giants it has a system of rings and the rings of Saturn are glorious like Jupiter Saturn also has dozens of moons and one of them is particularly notable Titan is the second largest moon in the solar system and it possesses an atmosphere remarkably like Earth's it is primarily composed of water ice and rocky material it is even possible that under the clouds and surface ice Titan has liquid water and maybe even microbial life it is 50% larger in diameter than our own moon and 80% more massive Saturn takes 29 years to orbit the Sun and does so at a distance of 890 million miles Uranus rolls on its side it is an icy giant of a planet the third-largest in the system like the other Giants Uranus has a ring system and numerous moons it is the seventh planet out and it orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9 billion miles a year on Uranus last 84 earth years because of its extreme axial tilt seasons on Uranus are worth a look at the time near the Solstice one pole continually faces the Sun while the other faces away only a narrow strip near the equator experiences Uranus is 17 our day at the other side of Uranus is orbit the orientation of the poles is reversed so each pole it's 42 years of continuous day followed by a 42-year night okay let's head to a point high over the ecliptic so we can see the relative sizes of the orbits of the sunward planets Neptune is a blue world it is the smallest of the giant planets in our system but still 30 thousand miles in diameter since the demotion of Pluto it is the furthest planet from the Sun Neptune's rings are very faint and of its 13 moons only Triton is massive enough to be round it rotates every 16 hours and orbits the Sun every 165 years at a distance of 2.8 billion miles pluto is now deemed a dwarf planet and a member of the Kuiper belt the Kuiper belt is a region of the solar system that extends just beyond the orbit of Neptune at about 2.8 billion miles out to about five billion miles like the asteroid belt it is crammed with many small bodies orbiting the Sun most of which are frozen methane ammonia and water here's a size comparison earth Ganymede Titan our Moon and several bodies from the Kuiper belt currently the largest known Kuiper belt bodies are eros Pluto Sedna and many more without formal names like fy9 and el61 a day on earth is a deceivingly simple concept today we'll examine that day on earth in detail perhaps uncovering a few surprises a day is a length of time it takes the earth to spin 360 degrees on its axis or is it 361 here is a simple model showing the earth the Sun and some background stars the earth travels around the Sun an ellipse with the Sun at one focus the model of course is not to scale let's begin our examination at noon one day the Sun is directly above the red line that will be our reference point watching from a high vantage point we see the earth complete 360 degrees of rotation but during that time the earth has also moved a bit in its orbit so even after a 360 degree turn the Sun is not directly above the same point on earth that it was at the beginning of the spin it is not noon of the next day the red reference line needs to spin a little more than 360 degrees to get us to noon the 360 degree rotation is called a sight Tyrael day while the noon to noon rotation is called a solar day Earth orbits the Sun once for about every three hundred and sixty six point 26 side aerial days and once for every 365 point 26 solar days not only that the length of the solar day varies throughout the year and for two different reasons first because of its orbit is an ellipse and not circle the Earth moves faster when it is near the Sun and slower when it is further from the Sun so the little extra amount of rotation that the earth needs to do to get from noon to noon changes throughout the year second because the earth is tilted on its axis the little extra rotation to get from noon to noon is largest at the solstices and smallest at the equinoxes so solar days grow progressively longer as we move from equinox March in September to solstice June in December and did we mention the Earth's spin is slowing down and the length of the solar day is increasing due to gravitational tides between the earth and the moon the length of the mean solar day is increasing at a rate of approximately 1.4 milliseconds every century two billion years ago there were about 750 days in a year now let's talk about day time that period out of 24 hours when it is light outside day versus night due to refraction and scattering of light by the atmosphere there can be day light even when the Sun is slightly below the horizon but day length is usually about the sun's disk being on or above the horizon so the day begins the moment the sun's disk appears during sunrise and ends the moment the sun's disk disappears during sunset at the equator daytime and nighttime are equal to within a few minutes but it distances north and south of the equator the length of the day varies with the season with the longest and shortest days being on the solstices at the poles once the Sun has risen it stays up for six months before it sets again and during the course of each day it travels in a complete circle around the edge of the sky because the earth travels at different speeds in its orbit the Sun is north of the Equator for almost four days more than half the year and the length of the average day in the northern hemisphere exceeds the length of the average day in the southern hemisphere by a few minutes in the northern hemisphere the Arctic Circle is the southernmost latitude where 24-hour daylight can occur at least one day in a year in the southern hemisphere the Antarctic Circle is the northernmost latitude where 24-hour daylight can occur at least one day in a year and daylight savings time is like the old man who caught off one end of the blanket and sewed it on the other end to make it longer a year on earth is measured by one complete trip around the Sun seems simple enough but there is a problem the earth doesn't travel in a path around the Sun that returns to its starting point so how do we know when a year starts or ends well one way called a Siberia year measures our orbit against the distant stars as viewed from the earth our orbit causes the Sun to appear to move through the constellations of the zodiac on a path called the ecliptic and when the Sun returns to its starting point a sigh Tyrael year has passed this motion is difficult to observe directly because the Stars cannot be seen when the Sun is in the sky however if you look at the sky before each dawn the annual motion is very noticeable the last stars seem to rise are not always the same and within a week or two an upward shift can be noted as an example in July in the northern hemisphere Orion cannot be seen in the dawn sky but in August it becomes easily visible measuring a year this way gives a period that is 365 days 6 hours 9 minutes and 10 seconds long another possibility is to measure the year against the passing of the seasons because of the tilt of the Earth on its axis the position of the Sun in the sky changes from day to day throughout the year if we were to take a picture of the Sun at noon regularly throughout the year we would see the Sun moving on this path called an analemma on the days in its orbit when the earth is at a maximum tilt towards or away from the Sun the length of the day line is at a maximum or minimum these days are called solstices and the Sun will be at the top left or bottom right of the analemma on the days when the earth's tilt is perfectly sideways to the Sun the day-night are equal in length these are the equinoxes and the Sun will be at a latitude dependent position in the analemma when the Sun goes from one vernal equinox to the next a tropical year has passed measuring this way gives a year that is 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes and 46 seconds long the length of a year on earth is affected by several gradual and cyclical changes in its orbit and its tilt first there is the precession of the Earth's axis over a period of about 26,000 years the Earth's axis traces out a circle in the sky one result of this is that the North Star changes over time right now the earth axis points towards Polaris five thousand years ago the axis pointed to a star in the constellation Draco and twelve thousand years ago the brilliant star Vega was the pole star and because of the twenty six thousand year cycle Vega will be the pole star again in fourteen thousand years the precession of the equinoxes is caused primarily by gravitational forces of the Sun and the moon acting on the earth while the axial tilt is a primary cause of seasons on the earth the distance from the Sun which changes throughout the year because of the elliptical shape of the Earth's orbit contribute to small bit of temperature variations throughout the year as well when the axis is aligned so it points towards the Sun during perihelion one hemisphere will have a greater difference between the seasons while the other hemisphere will have milder seasons the hemisphere which is in summer at perihelion will receive much of the corresponding increase in solar radiation but that same hemisphere will be in winter at aphelion and have a colder winter the other hemisphere will have a relatively warmer winter and cooler summer when the Earth's axis is aligned such that aphelion and perihelion occurred near the equinoxes the northern and southern hemisphere will have similar contrast in the seasons at present perihelion occurs during the southern hemisphere summer and aphelion is reached during the southern winter so the southern hemisphere seasons are somewhat more extreme than the northern hemisphere seasons when other factors are equal in addition the gravitational effects of other planets caused the ellipse of our orbit to slowly spin around the Sun it takes about 112 thousand years for the ellipse to revolve once relative to fixed stars when considered together but two forms of precession ad and it takes about 21,000 years for the Solstice to go from aphelion to aphelion the dates of the perihelion and the aphelion advance each year on this cycle an average of one day per 58 years the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit is a measure of how round or how oval the orbits shape is over thousands of years the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit varies as a result of gravitational attractions among the planets primarily Jupiter and Saturn the orbital eccentricity cycles with a period of roughly 100,000 years as the eccentricity of the orbit evolves the semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse remains unchanged so the length of the side irreal year remains unchanged as the earth travels in its orbit the duration of seasons depends on the eccentricity of the orbit when the orbital eccentricity is extreme the seasons that occur on the far side of the orbit are substantially longer in duration in addition to axial precession there is the axial tilt the angle of the Earth's rotational axis makes with its orbital plane it is currently about twenty-three point four degrees and is declining this tilt varies from twenty-two point one degrees to twenty-four point five degrees it makes one complete tilt and back every 41,000 years this change in tilt is directly related to ice ages on earth the last maximum tilt occurred in 8700 BC and the next minimum tilt will happen 11800 ad the inclination of Earth's orbit drifts up and down relative to the present orbit with a cycle having a period of about 70,000 years and the orbit also moves relative to the orbits of other planets as well by calculating the plane of unchanged total angular momentum of the solar system we can define the orbital plane called the invariable plane it is approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter the inclination of the Earth's orbit has a 100 thousand year cycle relative to the invariable plane this 100 thousand year cycle closely matches the 100 thousand year pattern of ice ages a year on earth is directly determined by all the various orbital motions of the earth so if someone tells you how many years old they are you might ask them is that side aerial tropical or anomalous years want to see something really big well watch this our starting point is our own mood we've seen men walk on them in and it's pretty big but even the smallest planets are bigger here are mercury Mars Venus and Earth and the gas giants in our solar system are huge in comparison here are Neptune Uranus Saturn and Jupiter and of course our Sun makes even Jupiter seem small but let's look at some really big stars here is Sirius and Pollux and Arcturus and all the Baron and Rigel and Deneb and Antares and Betelgeuse and the largest star we currently know about is V Y Canis Majoris on this scale our Sun would be one tenth the size of the tiny little dot what you see to the left we know mass distorts space we know light is affected by gravity and we know ayan Stein's theory of general relativity makes possible one of the strangest objects ever imagined by physicists if you could create a large enough distortion in space-time by placing enough mass and a small enough space you could create a region space-time so strongly curved that nothing not even light could escape it and since nothing can travel faster than the speed of light anything that entered this region of space-time would be trapped there until quantum mechanical effects allowed it to escape black holes can come in any size and have any mass all that is required is that enough mass can be concentrated to the point where it collapses under its own gravity stellar-mass black holes are formed when stars 20 or more times the size of our own Sun finally run out of fuel in their cores they rapidly cool and collapse and a shock wave from the collapse blows the outer layers of the stars to bits and a colossal explosion called a supernova but the small dense core of the star can remain bound together by the force of gravity as it continues to collapse inward under its own weight the atomic particles of the core are smashed together until all that is left is a black hole in its center lies the singularity the mass of an entire star crushed into a single point in space surrounding that is an invisible shell called the event horizon this is the cosmic point of no return once inside the event horizon nothing not even light can escape except through quantum mechanical processes supermassive black holes may contain billions of times the mass of our Sun these monsters live the center of every large galaxy micro black holes have tiny masses at which the effects of quantum mechanics are very important black holes of this type have been proposed to have formed during the Big Bang and would quickly evaporate due to said quantum mechanical effects at the end of their life it is believed that they would emit a sudden burst of energetic particles but no such bursts have been detected as of 2008 we can never see into or directly know about what happens inside the event horizon of a black hole in effect any object that crosses this imaginary line has left our universe for good but if nothing not even light can escape a black hole then how do astronomers manage to detect them it is possible to imagine spot in a solitary black hole by observing the bent star light from behind it but a better chance of detecting one would arise if they were not alone in space but accompanied by another star this black hole is drawing matter from a companion star which orbits it at a distance safely outside the event horizon as the gas spirals into the black hole it heats up and emits huge quantities of high-energy radiation intense radiation emerging from a small area or stars orbiting small invisible companions these are telltale calling cards of a black hole twelve and a half billion years ago the universe was littered with the remains of first generation stars and billions the second generation stars were born from these clouds small groups of these new stars were drawn to each other gravitationally and merged to form ever larger and larger groups our own galaxy the Milky Way is an example of a spiral galaxy born in this early era today it contains about 200 billion stars and is still growing as it absorbs small neighboring clusters of stars the center of our galaxy is in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius and like most large galaxies there is a monstrous black hole at the center the disk of our galaxy is about 100,000 light years across and on average is only about 12 thousand light years thick our own Sun is a third-generation star and is located about two-thirds of the way out on the spiral arm named Orion we are about 26,000 light-years from the center the Milky Way is a member of a group of 20 or 30 galaxies and star clusters called our local group the largest galaxies in this group is our sister spiral galaxy Andromeda is it possible for distant galaxies to be moving away from us faster than the speed of light and if it is would it be possible for us to see them surprisingly the answer to both questions is a resounding yes how is that possible how can something travel faster than the speed of light today we will try and paint an accurate picture of the universe based on the lambda cold dark matter model which is the best cosmological model today once we have painted that picture the answers to our questions will be straightforward let's assert that some kind of space-time quantum foam sort of something existed before our own universe began before our big Bey then we simply let Heisenberg's uncertainty principle go to work for us if we look at the tiniest speck allowed by quantum mechanics a small volume with a Planck length as it's linear scale the speck would have a volume of 10 to the minus 99 cubic centimeters and the largest amount of mass or energy that we could put in this volume without it becoming its own black hole is about 1/100 thousandth of a gram interestingly the uncertainty principle allows this much stuff to be created out of nothing for as long as 10 to the minus 43 seconds not a very long time but it will prove to be enough because if that much energy is created in the form of a certain type of scalar field then we have just successfully created a universe the best model of how our early universe grew after that initial quantum fluctuation created it includes inflation a period when the scalar field divides space into a brief period of extreme exponential expansion during inflation space erupted from its tiny beginnings and turn an unknown ly huge volume this enormous expansion generated an enormous amount of gravitational binding energy at least 10 to the 85th grams and this was counterbalanced by a corresponding group of positive energy in the scalar field what began as a mere fraction of a gram of energy has now become 10 to the 85th grams this is a huge number large enough to account for all the matter and energy that exists today but notice that the total energy in the universe is within a quantum fluctuation of equaling zero as a byproduct of the enormous growth of space during the inflationary period tiny quantum fluctuations grew into macroscopic fluctuations in the density of the scalar field making it ever so slightly lumpy this lumpiness provided the seeds for the formation of stars and galaxies and all the structure we see in the universe at the end of inflation the temperature throughout all of space was still enormous ly hot but as space continued to expand it cooled and the energy of the scalar field which now filled all the new and enormous ly huge volume of space decayed into dark matter and dark energy and normal matter the photons and quarks and electrons which in turns settle down into the protons neutrons and atoms that populate the universe today after about 380,000 years of expansion and cooling charged particles got together to form neutral atoms and suddenly the photons that were bumping into charged particles every second or two were free to zip unhindered across space this is the origin of the cosmic microwave background that we see today let's let this volume of blue dots represent all of space at that era then let's focus our attention on this tiny portion that has a radius of about 42 million light years this is the region that will be all of our observable universe in 13.7 billion years our earth will form somewhere in the center of this region in about nine billion years but we have a lot of expansion to experience first imagine that you are standing on a 100 meter track and some 199 meters away is going to walk toward you there's the starter's pistol and the walk begins but there's a problem the track is stretching growing longer as he walks he takes a one meter step every second but the track grows one meter for every 100 meters every second after 10 seconds the Walker has taken ten steps but the remaining 89 meters has grown so that he still has 98 meters from you another 10 seconds and he's still almost 97 meters away it will take him 460 seconds but he will eventually reach you and during that time the track is stretched so that it is now 10,000 meters long the other end of the track is now moving away from you much faster than the Walker can walk if he had to start there now he would never get here and the question of how far he walked is ambiguous we could say he walked 99 meters because that was the distance at the beginning or we could say that he walked 9900 meters because that was the distance at the end or we could say 460 meters because that is his normal speed times the time it took the expanding universe exhibits the same characteristics light from the edges of the 42 million light years sphere began their journey to the spot where the earth will develop about 13.7 billion years ago but during the trip the intervening space multiplied itself 1,000 90 times and now the spherical shell from which the light began is about 46 billion light years away this is the farthest into space we can see right now and it is called our particle horizon a hundred million years after inflation the first stars formed they were massive giants that formed in every region of space including our little sphere of observable universe those that formed on a shell a little insider expanding particle horizon are just visible today the light from these primitive Giants has been traveling over 13 billion years and the shell of space where they formed is now over 36 billion light years away so light from the microwave background was emitted from a distance of just 41 million light years away and that distance is now 46 billion light years and light from the earliest stars was emitted from a distance of 1.5 billion light years and that has grown to 36 billion light years due to the faster-than-light expansion of space in those early years the light was actually moving away from us for billions of years before the slowing expansion allowed it to start moving towards us like we see today from some distant galaxies that was emitted from five to six billion light years away comes from objects that were the most distant at the time the light was emitted massive objects like the earth and the Sun that are gravitationally bound to one another can overcome the expansion of space between them space is expanding in our system but the distance from the earth to the Sun does not change because of this expansion why because as space expands the Earth's orbit continually adjust to keep the earth at the correct distance that is demanded by the law of gravity this is also true for stars inside a galaxy that are gravitationally bound and is true even for local clusters of galaxies as space expands the distance between the bodies constantly adjusts to comply with the laws of gravity the wavelength of light from distant objects is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum if they were moving away from us and the expansion of space is measurable by measuring the redshift and unlike the Doppler redshift the cosmological redshift says nothing about the recessional velocity of the emitting object either at the time the light was admitted or at the time the light was received Hubble's law says the further away an object is the faster it is receding without limit so there are always objects far enough away to be receding faster than the speed of light objects we see with a redshift of about 1.46 are moving away from us at the speed of light and all objects with larger redshifts are receding faster than the speed of light most objects in the extended universe are traveling away from us with velocities fast enough that we will never see them in effect we have an event horizon and events beyond our event horizon are effectively unknowable to us objects that have a current redshift of about 1.8 are currently about 18 billion light-years away and are now crossing our event horizon never to be heard from again finally this is a time sequence of the evolution of our universe Big Bang followed by inflation reheating or the birth of matter birth and death of the first stars and the ongoing formation and growth of galaxies when we look out into the universe we're looking backwards in time looking at the universe as it was when it was a lot smaller and a lot younger you"

http://shop.awakenwithjp.com/",Being Interviewed by a Skeptic - Ultra Spiritual Life episode 16 - with JP Sears,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVzzb8THZdY,0,178646,2844,68,453,kVzzb8THZdY,JP welcome thank you you just want to have a seat we'll get started okay right here mm-hmm what's the first question Paige thank you it's a lot better would you say you're with again with Religion Dispatches and now we I'm with the cubit we do religion and science and so that's why I was so interested in this press release that you are scientifically proven to be the most spiritual person so thank you for this interview I hadn't heard of you before never heard of you guys is it is that like a tabloid no we're a serious journal we have an academic lean to us and we're very interested in doing long-form interviews and investigating spiritual people again I hadn't heard of you before but interested to see what you're all about there's a lot of stuff on you out there no there's not that much I mean a lot of self-promotion let's get things started I'd love to know what you think the relationship between religion and science yes religion and science are the exact same thing scientists are religiously scientific and when you think about it the higher power for scientists is physics in scientists worship the only begotten son of physics gravity and religion is purely based on science I mean religion is based on scientific principles such as recording what someone says 80 years after they say it in a different light which it's very scientific you're saying that science is itself a new religion it's an older religion science is itself much newer than religion Western Sciences 200-300 years old according to you according to history a history is actually a pretty shallow recollection of events if you look beyond history if you actually look to before history started and look at those events you'll see that science was there all along before there was any scientific evidence of science only recently past few hundred years has science been scientifically proven to exist okay let's just move on the Internet Internet is new we can agree on that the Internet's a trend I mean how long do you think the trend of the Internet is going to last I give it four or five more years tops okay so I'll give you that let's say that the Internet is only the last for five more years nonetheless it seems to be affecting people's relationship with each other the relationship with the way they see themselves do you think that the Internet has affected spirituality in America I do I think spirituality at its core when you get to the heart of spirituality it's all about showing other people how spiritual you are the Internet has brought the blessing of being able to exponentially odd cast yourself to other people so has the internet helped people become more spiritual note it's helped people become ultra spiritual I like where you're gone with this you're saying ultra spiritual is a bad thing it's not even a thing you're you're judging it to be a bad thing but it's not even a thing so I'll judge your judgement to be an inaccurate judgement is ultra spirituality good or bad ultra spirituality is it's the eye of a hurricane so is there like a second part to that metaphor or is you just going to leave it at that well there's wind in a hurricane but that's not ultra spirituality it's the eye of the hurricane and you know you need weather conditions to have a hurricane you there usually by the ocean warm part of the country death and destruction so yeah I mean fill in the blanks but in that metaphor you would only have ultra spirituality on the coasts hurricanes and ultra spirituality are always on the coast and when you think about it the only part of the hurricane that is not destructive is the either hurricane therefore that tells us because ultra spirituality has been proven to be the eye of the hurricane everything that's not ultra spirituality is the destructive force in life on the coasts what about Katrina I preferred if you don't bring my ex-girlfriends into this kind do you think that machines will ever be conscious if not why if so would they ever be ultra spiritual will machines become conscious maybe not will we learn how to become conscious of machines that's where it's at the good thing about machines is they don't have any of it call it nasty atrocities of humanity they don't have emotions which are impediments to growth they don't go to the bathroom that's kind of gross so I my bathroom is really gross I imagine it's actually incredibly gross your bathroom I'm sorry anyway you're saying I was saying Andrew we do need more machines I mean to help humanity I think the way the world is evolving is replacing human jobs with machines robots because these are jobs people don't want to do anyway and the best thing you can do for someone who's in a job earning a living doing something they don't want to do best thing is to eliminate their jobs that way they're not earning an income anymore doing something they hate so they're forced to become homeless and therefore figure out what they really want to do in life and if we never had machines in robots how would that happen yeah I'm a little bit confused we teach the robots how to do the human jobs and no human wants to do working in factories interacting with other people plumbers absolutely journalists for that matter you know you're saying is that you could be replaced by a robot will there be a robot that'll be able to replace ultra spiritual JP Sears no only JP Sears can replace JP Sears just in a grander version the next time if that makes sense like a Russian nesting doll but bigger versions of this it's like that only the way I said it was a lot better I'm supposed to ask you for this website about who you think the five most important spiritual gurus are maybe you just list them off we do a quick numbered 1 dr to have my name down no yeah i was recently voted the world's most spiritual man by the global association of spiritual advancement so number one GP seers and this globalisation of e a global association of spiritual advancement how could I talk to there to give verification that I own that company you own the company it's a conflict of interest to call yourself the most spiritual person on the company knowing the CEO who else would be better also a for-profit business non profit nonprofit the business makes no profit all proceeds go to me personally where I buy things that I would like to have so the organization is a non-profit and the money that it makes goes to you that's not a non-profit that's a for-profit if you think spiritually which I would afford you they out there you need to do so nothing there I'll still afford you the opportunity to do so where do I end and you begin so do all the profits go to me in a way yes but in a more conscious perspective you pay me money and you pay everybody else money because all is one everybody else is a part of me so if all is one would you give me some money number two would be the Dalai Lama number three would have to be Gandhi even though he's been dead there's money like me to question is he really that number four is cold yeah he's got any dead he would have died of old age even if he hadn't been kindled allegedly a gunshot wound let's go any shot let's be creative your world if you want to fake your death gunshot really yeah that would be really hard to think he was Gandhi number four Hilary Clinton obviously really so you think that Hillary Clinton is the number four most spiritual person absolutely I heard her wife bill have done more for the world and a good sense than anything else number five would have to be what's that guy's name that owned Starbucks Howard Schultz I'm not a big Snoopy fan probably dr. Seuss went to a press release that I found when I googled you you're developing a wise phone what's that all about what's smarter than a smart phone a wise phone so future technology has everything to do with wives phones not smart phones smart phones are dumb smartphones are smart they're smarter than a normal phone so what do you think but you got assets who's thinking that thought my phone makes me smarter because it helps me with directions it helps me look up Wikipedia articles so I say my phone makes me smarter did you google mining on your smartphone I did or a lot of shirtless pictures the number one benefit of your smartphone so the wise phone it's the wave of the future first off it's going to have an app which means application where you can have a picture of yourself doing yoga in front of all the wonders of the world different scenes of nature and you don't even need to be there it overlays you on the scene so you get automatically better at yoga you don't even have to do yoga because part of the app is it puts your face and your body structure in the overlay so all of a sudden you're a yoga expert in front of the pyramids doing a downward dog you were never there you never did yoga but you're an expert at yoga because the internet via the wise phone for the next five years of the internet surround expresses your spirituality to everybody else if your spiritual and nobody knows it are you really spiritual yeah no me you are not why does anyone need to know whether you're meditating exactly how would they know if they don't know a wise man once said I think this was Ronald Reagan if a tree falls in the forest and nobody is there to hear it does it make a sound where did you get that quote because pre sure it's older than Ronald Reagan no I think it was raid and it just it trickles down from the ether who's Raiden who is the most ultra spiritual president besides Hillary Clinton without a doubt Nikola Tesla I mean he's created energy without using energy he makes cars that are awesome this isn't real this isn't are you is this bit that's a joke you don't know who Tesla is I know who Tesla is he's not he's never a president you're talking about an electric car that's what Edison wants you to think if Edison had great investment in pushing down Tesla's work does he want it to sell as lightbulbs electricity which is far less efficient far less effective than Tesla's work okay I are you with Edison's men I have no idea what you're talking about I can't tell if you're crazy if you're a jerk but this is in kind of candid camera situation I'm very conscious as what I am you guys with the Oprah network I think she gives better interviews than you usually she has people like outside and the grass under a tree so religions have believers they believe in a set of what you might call dogmas what others might say or Creed's ultra spirituality says that it's against beliefs and against dogmas so what do you call yourselves if you can't be a believer in ultra spirituality problem with believers is they're taught how to think other people are taught what to think but my ultra spiritual followers I teach them how that what they think is what they actually think that's kinda like when you have a sheep you teach it to enjoy its cage in being part of the herd a supply very helpful wool to stay warm in the winter months make it noxious somes though it's slight because it like a monkey chirp they do it's like I thought every time a sheep or the followers either the ones with wool what are those again cheap you will recently sued for the death of five people via sweat lodge at one of your retreats in any response to those allegations I don't know what you're talking about is the first thing my lawyer told me to say the second thing he told me to say is they're not true whatever they are that I don't know what you're talking about and the third thing he told me to say is death is only an illusion you might want to read that down you've been accused of money laundering allegedly accused you've been accused of selling pharmaceutical drugs without a license I'm not going to deny that okay you've been accused of operating a soft-serve franchise without a license it's not very though allegedly so I'm just going to give you a list of practices my editor wants you to just tell me whether this is ultra spiritual or religious praying you know like a big like tiger Gideon spray know like it's a church vegetarian is much worse spiritual veganism is vegetarianism what just Cystic and moving on spiritual or ultra spiritual telling lies political speak I gotta check about kickback funds spiritual or ultra spiritual morning coffee ultra spiritual dance Athens if it's trance dance ultra spiritual if it's dirty dancing religion factory outlets are there yoga clothing stores and those outlets going to a psychologist it's a good idea for you to do chocolate chip cookies there for Santa Claus there for Christianity religious gun ownership ultra spiritual think that about does it Thank You JP it's been interesting and I really hope that I don't come back here but you're welcome we're done you have a lot of angry I know it's I'm sorry I didn't mean a snappy like that I just have really low blood sugar right now you need something to eat got crackers sites that have two done up gluten in it does it because if I eat gluten it's not good it's like diarrhea on the spot I like the way you think I see so much potential you I would I look at your essence I can see you have so much power but you hold yourself back and I can see you've been through challenges in your past I have and I can see you're still stuck but you want that power you want to reach you tential is that right that's exactly right have you ever thought about joining the ultra spiritual side what would that look like well let me show you you you I don't think I could do something like that what if you already have

Sears,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipTlosTt3y8,0,589545,16285,550,3944,ipTlosTt3y8,how can you deal with a narcissist this is without a doubt the most asked question that I've been asked that I have yet to answer so here's my opinion on it how you can deal with a narcissist first and foremost I would challenge you if you're in a relationship with a narcissist I would challenge you to ask yourself this question why am i a perfect match for a narcissist yikes that is absolutely not a popular question to ask when we are in a relationship with a narcissist typically traditionally what we find what we crave and usually what we get when we're in a relationship with a narcissist we crave sympathy we we actually back ourselves into a corner of victimization we convince the world oh poor me I'm in a relationship with this jerk he needs to be fixed how can I fix him poor me those are all actually pretty narcissistic thoughts themselves I personally don't like it what I'm about to say it's not at all popular but I think the popular view of the other person who's part of the narcissistic relationship the popular view is in my opinion incredibly terrible it's very disempowering even though it's popular and it's what we crave my perspective is we are in the relationship with the narcissist because we are a perfect match for them that's why we're in it so from my point of view there is a massive amount of self responsibility that we have the potential to take when we're dealing with a narcissist as we think about that we'll get back to that a little bit more first let's take a look at what a narcissist actually is my definition of a narcissist is it's someone who's self-absorbed someone who thinks the world revolves around them it's my definition I like it I also printed up from Psychology Today the nine criteria that are typically used to classify a narcissist let me breathe through these real quick number one someone who has a grandiose sense of self-importance number two someone whose preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success power brilliance beauty or ideal love number three someone who believes he or she is special and unique and can only be understood by or should associate with others special or high status people I feel it's pretty special right now myself I'm on video number four requires excessive admiration by the way be sure to LIKE this video I'll feel pretty well admired number five they have a sense of entitlement number six there interpersonally exploitative number seven they lack empathy is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others in a relationship this is typically the biggest criteria where people get emotionally charged about my partner he most the time he or she can't connect with my needs I'm lonely I'm isolated they don't care about my needs so let me just read number seven again because this one is super common they lack empathy is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others hence they seem very self-absorbed only preoccupied with their needs their feelings themselves number eight they're often envious of others and believe that others are envious of him or her number nine they show arrogance hmm so with that say why are you a perfect match for a nice assist if you imagine there's a knife that narcissist at the other end of the spectrum there's you I mean if you are in a relationship with a narcissist you're connected to them so there you are at the other end of the spectrum from my perspective what the opposite polarity of narcissism is patheticness I don't mean that in a judgmental way I just mean that in a descriptive way to represent the polarity of the other person who's in a relationship with a narcissist so there we are I'm in a relationship with a narcissist that's their dysfunction what's my dysfunction ah I don't function from a posture of narcissistic Ness that's the word I function from a posture of patheticness so why are we a perfect fit because in my opinion you have a lot in common you simply express what you have in common differently the expression is through opposite polarities but what is expressed is what you have in common what is that my opinion is it's a deep-seated sense of insignificance when we don't know how to deal with our insignificance head-on we suppress it it goes down down down down to the point where we are not aware of it we repress it and then we express it in a misdirected way this case through one of two polarities narcissism the world revolves around me it's all about me or the other polarity which may happen to be your eye patheticness nothing revolves around me it's never about me and in fact the biggest danger of patheticness is it's hard to see narcissism it's very socially unacceptable because it's more socially recognizable patheticness it's very socially unrecognizable it wears an invisible cloak because it's the passive polarity of the repressed insignificance narcissism ez2c it's the active polarity of repressed insignificance so with patheticness when we are in that position we usually don't know it and we notice the immediate danger my partner's narcissistic that's painful on me so he is narcissistic hehehe we realize we're actually solidifying our position of patheticness nothing is about me because I'm making that all about the narcissist that's why we are an absolutely perfect fit for each other hmm so I would absolutely invite you to climb out of any hole of victimization that you've dug yourself in in see where you're at you are in a relationship with a narcissist because you are just like them you simply express your likeness differently so I would guess the key to your happiness satisfaction relationship success has nothing to do with altering the narcissist and leaving yourself unchecked what I usually find happens working with people is you'll go from one narcissist to the next relationship he looks pretty cool she looks pretty cool turns out to be another narcissist why because we haven't changed ourselves we haven't changed how we're repressing something that causes us to polarize into an unwanted polarity of patheticness so what can we do about that first off if I haven't beaten this dead horse to death let's just kick it in the rib cage one more time see that the assist is a mirror to your unresolved stuff of self your unresolved feelings your unresolved wounds your unresolved disempowering beliefs of self that you probably don't know you have why because they're repressed what's expressed is the passive polarity of patheticness again is patheticness not judgemental 99% of the times when we use the word patheticness we're using it in a demeaning belittling way I absolutely do not intend it to be that that meaning I intended to represent the passive polarity of repressed and significance narcissists overcompensate as a way of escaping the insignificance that they desperately want to run away from overcompensating by seeking significance artificially flavored significance hmm then the compensation for those of us who go to the pathetic polarity we're actually under compensating that's never about me I don't matter well that's equally as delusional as the narcissist you do matter you don't met you you're the world doesn't revolve around you nor is it that you are not a part of the world you are a part of the world so what to do beyond seeing your narcissistic comrades as your mirror expressing your likeness differently I would dare say we have to look at our insignificance start embracing it rather than repressing it suppressing it running away from that we need to run towards it with open arms how can we do that to me there is no replacement for vulnerability I think brené Brown says the best with vulnerability vulnerability is putting courage over control its trumping the need for control with the courage the courage to accept and feel what we don't want to feel what we don't want to look at control when you look at a narcissist or pathetic mist those polarities are that of control the space in between that is the place of surrendering control it's a place of intimacy with ourself it's a place of vulnerability having the courage rather than the need for control to embrace what is there hmm what deep-seated sense of insignificance do I perhaps carry that I try and escape through making the world about me or making it so that I don't even matter in the world we have to feel our feelings no replacement for that I've never found a replacement for feeling our feelings for about 30 years I've tried to just think about my feelings my results have been zero percent effective I'll keep trying for a little while but I'm guessing they'll continue to be zero percent effective we have the Faculty of a brain good I don't want to amputate mine we also have the fact Faculty of a heart for a reason I think it's because we need to feel our feelings acting out misdirected behaviors narcissism patheticness that is methods of escaping our feelings and granted they cause unwanted other feelings that feel yucky yet those yucky feelings themselves help us escape the deeper seeded sense of yuckiness that is our insignificance yuckiness is a professional term by the way and lastly I think as a whole what we need to look at is what taught us to see and feel about ourselves as insignificant did we observe through our perception as delusional as it is but it was ours did we believe our parents saw as as someone who wasn't inequal someone who didn't matter as much did I actually surrender parts of myself not in my good sense of the word but in the sense of throwing part of myself under the bus so that I could meet other people's expectations I certainly did my emotional self through that hunk of me right under the bus at a super early age because I simply felt it was easier for me to meet the expectations of my family friends society list goes on if I wasn't an emotionally needy kid so what that taught me what the part of me that is emotional which is a huge part of me taught that part of me you are insignificant you don't matter and that doesn't feel good and granted that wasn't a my conscious awareness most of the time yeah looking back I sure did act out a hell of a lot of narcissistic behavior as a compensation for it in patheticness as a compensation for it I guess I'm multi-talented hmm says my narcissistic self no self-deprecating so I think that was my pathetic self so with that said Socrates said the unexamined life is a life not worth living so here the call to action is do your best to examine your life where did your sense of insignificance come from where did you learn it what taught it to you granted I believe you taught it to you but what was the environment that you taught it to yourself in why I think it's very healing and empowering to go to those places and our memory bank be they yesteryear or in our childhood that gives us the opportunity to reteach ourselves a new lesson from today's values rather than having us be a slave to our compensatory mechanisms of repressing our sense of in significant that we adopted maybe as a child maybe a teenager maybe our adult life but the point is are they serving us today discomfort I believe is the prime signal of the body's wisdom trying to get us to pay attention to a message if that discomfort registers in a relationship with someone who we call a narcissist then maybe that's a call of action to become more self-aware that other person aware yeah we can probably list their narcissistic faults until we're blue I don't know why we would turn blue maybe a oxygen deprivation metaphor we can also list all the ways that we think we could fix them that we you know their faults and how they could fix them well that's other person awareness and that and of itself is an escape mechanism of what's in our heart I do believe it's part of the human condition where we all feel a deep sense of insignificance that kind of says if people knew who I really was they could never love me hence you have a narcissist hence you have a pathetic Asst in in the graceful space in-between is a place of stillness called the real you there might be wounds there there might be a sense of insignificance there and I do believe our greatest gifts are there as well oftentimes we don't find those great gifts until we find our wounds our senses of insignificance why because we're avoiding the dwelling ground of our great gifts because what else is there is our pain we go find our pain nurture it rather than run from it and amazingly we oftentimes by default find some of the gifts of the miraculous being that I believe we all are with that said thank you for Dancing with me on my opinion of how to deal with a narcissist which really means how to deal with the purse who's in a relationship with a narcissist which probably resembles the person who you see in the mirror every morning hmm with that said please leave your comments below I'd love to hear what you think whether you agree disagree or somewhere in the middle I would love to see it end because I'm self-absorbed enough to believe that what I have to say is important or at least that I want you to believe it's important please be sure to subscribe to my channel and I look forward to talking with you next time

Next episode will be on August 15th",History Buffs: We Were Soldiers,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ABJVrRfr2Q,0,2676978,37382,4893,9196,6ABJVrRfr2Q,so hello and welcome history buffs my name is nick hodges and today's review will be we were soldiers based on the book we were soldiers once and young by lieutenant general howe moore and war journalist joseph galloway this is the story about america's first major battle in the vietnam war where 400 american soldiers were surrounded by an nva division of 4 000 men in the central highlands of vietnam unlike its more notable predecessors though this is a vietnam war movie that is more focused on the history behind the conflict rather than the controversial politics we've come to expect so taking a back seat are the f-bombs the n-words and the g words and put at the forefront instead are the tactics and strategies of the real battles and the men who fought them all necessary ingredients to making a good historical film but does it guarantee a good vietnam war movie well let's find out in we were soldiers so the film begins in 1964 at the height of the cold war the western world's eyes were locked on a remote corner of southeast asia called vietnam gone were the days of its french imperialism and a new question formed on everyone's mind would vietnam's future ultimately be based under a regime of capitalism or communism following the end of the indochina war a ceasefire was agreed upon by french and viet minh forces at the geneva conference of 1954 it was then decided that vietnam was to be temporarily divided at the 17th parallel with the communist north and the capitalist south this was under promise that france would withdraw from the conflict and the country officially ending decades of french imperial rule there was also to be an election in 1956 for a single vietnamese government to reunify the country however america chose to misinterpret the temporary ceasefire as temporary preferring much more instead to consider it as a permanent division between a communist north and a capitalist south the reason behind this thinking was that the north was predicted to win the 1956 election due to its higher population america's main fear was that if vietnam was to be unified under a single communist government then communism would eventually spread throughout the whole of southeast asia so it comes as no surprise when the reunification election was cancelled and this was probably the biggest spark that ignited the vietnam war and this is where the movie kicks in by 1964 america wasn't officially involved in vietnam but it had been supporting the south of military agent advisors for quite some time however it didn't escape them that this conflict would inevitably escalate and result with their direct military involvement so prepared for this by rethinking its tactics and introducing new technologies most notably the helicopter which would give him a huge advantage in being able to commit his forces absolutely anywhere armed with this its economic wealth and its position as a superpower america was confident of an easy victory within a matter of months when making we were soldiers randa wallace the writer and director of the film had one main objective when reading the book in which the film must be based on he came across a passage talking about the vietnam war which said hollywood got it wrong every damn time with these words in mind he focused on trying to get it right and that is certainly a noble undertaking i mean i wish more filmmakers thought this way now regarding the passage i can kind of understand where that book is coming from the thing is that when we think of the vietnam war what do we usually think of apart from it obviously having the best soundtrack of all time we think of the quintessential vietnam war movie and our minds usually wander to a select few from the 70s and 80s the main ones being apocalypse now deer hunter platoon for metal jackets and casualties of war all of them without a doubt are some of the best films in american cinema but were they made in mind to accurately portray the vietnam war probably not instead the main focus of those movies is to portray the insanity of war and the loss of innocence history takes a back seat in these historical depictions and political and philosophical motifs are at the forefront to be analyzed instead now despite them not being accurate they certainly were authentic and captured the chaos and brutality of that conflict however these films are so ingrained into pop culture that scenes that once moved us now make us laugh scenes that once shocked us now just generally entertain and amuse us and why not these characters and their performances are just as crazy and eccentric as the movies themselves they they're really fun to watch do you suck nicks sir no sir are you a peter pepper sir no sir i bet you're the kind of guy that would have the goddamn comment courtesy to give him a reach around i'll be watching you i mean even if someone who has never seen any of these movies they will still recognize them when they're on screen and because they're so over the top their initial success has in a way let our interpretation of the vietnam war to become slightly stylized i'm going for the flag you shouldn't do that why not deep in enemy territory you've got to choose our moment carefully let's just swarm in with ace they're not just in the jungle they are the jungler what do you think this is vietnam yeah now am i saying that we were soldiers is better than those movies of course not what i'm saying is that it was made with historical accuracy in mind and for all intents and purposes it mostly succeeds some of the most horrific moments in the film were recreated under the supervision of lieutenant general hal moore and joseph galloway who were in the actual battle one scene in particular stands out and from the way joseph galloway describes it they definitely got those scenes right and in that flame i could see these two men dancing and screaming and someone yelled get this man's feet and i reached down and picked him up and uh his boots crumbled the flesh on his ankles just peeled off i could feel the ankle bone in the palm of my hands and we carried him over to where the wounded were was a young specialist uh named jim nakayama out of uh rigby idaho married wife had a baby that week he died two days later now as much as randall wallace makes a big deal about wanting to get it right there's one scene in the movie that completely contradicts that objective now if you want to make a historically accurate film then you have to be authentic to the times in which it's set in and it seems like this that pisses me off to no end in the meantime the laundromat in town's okay but they won't let you wash your colored things in their machines in a public laundromat didn't make any sense to me either but i'm telling you they have a big sign right in the window says whites only what honey they mean white people only that's awful your husband is wearing the uniform of a country that allows a place to to say that his laundry's not good enough when he could die for i'm sorry i just that's all right honey movie are you seriously trying to tell me that this woman is so gormless that she's only learning about racial segregation now it's 1964. it's the height of the civil rights movement one of the biggest and most influential political movements in u.s history she should know this stuff simply by being alive honestly what was going through her mind when she was watching the march in washington in 1963. i have a dream that one day oh my god this guy's like so boring why is everyone telling me that what's this there's no racism in this country it must be like some sort of like liberal agenda or something i'm gonna change the channel i like cartoons although we were soldiers is predominantly based on the battle of the arduino valley it actually summarizes really well how the world's greatest superpower was defeated this scene in particular speaks volumes about america's overconfidence and ill-fated decision to underestimate its enemy and especially its military victories in the past white house anticipates the buildup and wants of the victory over cavemen and black pajamas we wouldn't be there if they hadn't already beaten the french army the french army what's that now this just could be potential french bashing but i'm gonna give this movie the benefit of the doubt because this kind of arrogance is exactly what the mindset of america's leaders was prior to the war if they bothered to take the threat of north vietnam seriously they would then understand that they were facing an enemy with 20 years of combat experience on its own ground and an enemy that had successfully defeated japanese occupation of world war ii and the french in the first indochina war yes cavemen in black pajamas managed to defeat both the empires of japan and france but america chose to ignore this because it was convinced that just its aerial power alone would simply bomb north vietnam into submission by the war's end they had dropped more bombs than all the allies and axis powers did in world war ii and in the end it achieved very little once in vietnam another problem came up where aside from difficulties with its jungle environment american troops had no real fixed objectives to take this wouldn't be like world war ii where they would take one position then move on to the next so instead they operated under search and destroy missions simple orders hal find the enemy and kill him and it didn't take long before the vietnamese discovered flaws in their execution as shown in the movie the americans would usually bomb an area with either artillery or airstrikes to prepare a landing zone for its soldiers once they arrived by helicopter they would then comb the surrounding area to hunt down enemy combatants however all this really did was alert the north vietnamese that the americans were on their way they might as well have shot up a giant flare in the sky to mark their position because they both pretty much achieved the same thing in the end as any advantage and surprise was lost it was through this very way that the vietnamese were able to predict exactly when and where the americans would attack another thing is that this allowed the vietnamese to choose whether or not they wanted to fight since many of their bases were built underground if they decided not to fight then they would just let the americans walk right by them out of all the engagements in the vietnam war most were chosen by the north vietnamese another advantage that the north vietnamese had over the americans was the will to fight now i'm not trying to downplay their importance or courage but the fact of the matter is that many of the american soldiers were draftees and the average conscript simply wanted to do his years of service and just get back home alive whereas a north vietnamese soldier absolutely believed they were fighting for their country and not just for communism as america believed at the time there's a minor character in the movie that really helps show the average nba soldier's commitment to fighting this war we see a young man writing to his wife on the front line before the second day of the battle now there's nothing especially intimidating about this man he's quite thin and wears glasses and overall just appears to be an average guy and he appears even more so the next time we see him we can tell that he's completely terrified by the way he hesitates shaking this notion that the american soldiers are dealing with suicidal fanatics and not with genuine human beings who are just as scared as they are just by us seeing him write to his wife we know that this character has something to live for and yet without hesitation he throws it all away with a bayonet charge this small character personifies north vietnam's unshaking will and determination to resist this foreign power so what was america's answer in fighting and defeating such an enemy well this is summarized perfectly and we were soldiers over the course of the movie we see almost non-stop fighting as the americans gunned down wave after wave of nva and vietcong soldiers this film truly captures how horrific and intense this battle was and it can't be stated enough the bravery it took for both the americans and the vietnamese to fight in such appalling conditions amidst napalm and artillery strike to machine gun fire to sometimes fighting with just their bare hands it really must have been hell on earth and so when the americans finally prevail and win the battle the aftermath is almost as shocking as the battle itself was we as an audience are given time to breathe and really think about what we just watched this is after all a reenactment of a battle that really took place and with all this death and destruction we witnessed what did it really achieve in the end well the americans certainly achieved their original objective of finding their enemy and killing him they claimed victory is seen as even more incredible by the fact that they survived against such terrible odds however in the immediate aftermath of the battle when the americans pack up their dead and wounded they leave and the north vietnamese come right back in and what follows is without a doubt my favorite scene in the entire film this little moment right here not only encompasses the harsh reality of this battle but also eludes and is what is to come foreign foreign this battle would set the president for how the rest of this war would be fought by america without clear objectives to take the americans would instead claim their victories not by territory gained but by body count their theory being that this method of attrition would prove to be the decisive point in winning this war i'm thinking of the intent of the mission there's everything we've fought in the past has been to gain ground yes but you know the basic mission of any military force is to destroy the enemy or his will to fight and it's been our tradition since we were tied to the ground to translate that into terms of ground objectives but that was never the real purpose that just helped you achieve the end here we can free ourselves of those ground considerations and we go more directly for the enemy wherever he may be what was originally thought to be one within a matter of months lasted eight years for the united states and claimed the lives of over 58 000 americans and untold millions of vietnamese in the end it was instead the american people who lost their will to fight sick of an endless cycle of violence and empty promises of a victory within sight in 1973 the united states finally submitted to public pressure and withdrew from the war and within two years south vietnam was finally annexed by the north overall i'd say that we were soldiers is a good historical movie to watch once i started researching the battle of the ardrang valley it was clear to me how much the filmmakers respected the source material and their attempt to make this battle as true to life as possible really shows on the screen and i also have to applaud and recognize randall wallace's decision to present us with a non-biased film taking the time and the effort to highlight the courage and the sacrifice both the americans and the vietnamese made in this tragic battle however i can't ignore key moments here and there that really ruin my viewing experience it really baffles me as to why they're even there in the first place because i'd be enjoying what's going on in the movie and then they would spoil it by going so over the top like this really out of place scene that is so brimming with american patriotism it makes my eyes roll to the back of my head i'm glad i could die for my country and not two seconds later they slap in another generic war movie death scene tell my wife come on i know it sounds like i'm nitpicking here but this is so cliched if you have to write a death scene then do it an original way this feels like it's just ticking a box of what to include in a war movie there's a reason why we make fun of death scenes like this no mike and don't get me started on any scenes with the kids their performances and the writing feel so forced and artificial it makes me cringe every time it's on screen the decision on putting them there must have been like how do we get the audience to care about how more i know let's make his kids as cute as possible they could waddle around in his jump boots and saying bingo hey how about we go back to bingo what do you say bingo stupid it really takes me out of the movie and that makes it that much harder for me to tell you to watch it as for this performance i have no idea why they decided to go with this take rather than inspiring empathy it just honestly makes me laugh anyway aside from these various hiccups we were soldier successes outweigh its mistakes in the long run whether they truly got it right is up for debate but any true history buff will be able to see that at least they tried brandon wallace may have disregarded the politics we have come to expect from a vietnam war movie but special care and attention was made instead to accurately recreate an important battle from a very controversial war and the fact that we were soldiers goes beyond that to summarize that entire conflict and its inevitable outcome shows us the maturity and dedicated research that went into its execution my only true complaint is that i wish randall wallace made that same effort when writing braveheart but that's perhaps best left for another review for another day well that about wraps it up my name is nick hodges and thanks for watching history buffs and remember if you like the show help the channel

very few okay well strap in because I'm glad I get to tell you about this what happened some years ago was that NASA had completed a low-resolution map of the night sky and they decided that they wanted to go deeper so they picked a little tiny patch of space a patch of space that's about the size of a pencil tip at arm's length and it was black there was nothing there and what they decided they would do is point the finely-honed lens of the Hubble telescope at that little patch of space so every time the Hubble came around the earth they pointed the telescope that little patch to see if they could capture any photons and see if there was actually something in there that was too dim to see normally so every time the Hubble came around the earth they pointed it for 20 minutes and they pulled this trick off 400 times and at the end of that they compiled all the information they collected all the lonely photons that had trickled in from distant reaches of the universe and they put it together and they found that there was something in that little patch of space after all and it wasn't a star and it wasn't a cluster of stars it was 10,000 galaxies now a galaxy is a hundred billion stars so we're talking a thousand trillion stars in this little patch of space each one of those stars just like our Sun many of them presumably with planetary systems around them all of them with the potential to house unknown forms of biology right so I think this is a good consciousness razor to think about the the size of the mysteries that surround us so I am a scientist I've devoted my entire life to science because I figure if we want to understand what's going on in the strange world around us there's probably no better method than to directly study the blueprints and science and last 400 years has been tremendously successful we have cured smallpox and polio and gotten men to the moon and made the internet and triple lifespans I think what you really get from a life in science is this knowledge that after you walk the pier of everything that we know in science at some point you reach the end of the pier and beyond the end is everything that we don't know it's all the uncharted waters the deep mysteries that we don't have insight into yet like why mass and energy are equivalent or what dark matter and dark energy are or why there are multiple spatial dimensions or how you build consciousness from mechanical pieces and parts that's the real lesson that you get from science is about the vastness of our ignorance now I have no doubt that every generation we will continue to add a few more slats to the pier but it's a huge ocean and we don't really have any guarantee how far we'll get and certainly in our brief twinkling of a 21st century lifetime we're not going to get to the end of that and so the lesson that you get from science is that what we know is so vastly outstripped by what we don't know so given that situation I have been interested in what has happened this last decade with with the books by by the Neo atheists and these books are some of my favorite books and they're very important and insightful books but what's been interesting to me is the public reaction to them because what they have led to as far as I can see is something of a misconception widely that scientists don't have the capacity to to gamble beyond the available data and that scientists are acting is that we've got it all figured out we understand it F equals MA equals MC squared we can put in equations or if we can't yet then we're pretty close and it should suffice to capture a description of the whole cosmos I think that's actually not a very good description of how science actually operates Ben's right when he said that science is about disproving other people's hypotheses but it's about so much more than that science is really about this creativity of making up new hypotheses and there's a part of the scientific temperament is this tolerance for holding multiple hypotheses in mind at the same time now what we actually do is we make up new stories in the laboratory every day and then we when we seek evidence we gather evidence to weigh in favor of some stories over others but it's often the case that some questions are too far out right now they're beyond the toolbox of science and as a result we're unable to gather evidence for them and in that situation it's okay science is comfortable holding multiple hypotheses on the table that ambiguity is accepted as part of the relationship we have with Mother Nature it's part of the vast mysteries around us we have to have that ambiguity so I don't pretend like we've got it all figured out and as a result I have felt sometimes that perhaps we know too little to commit to a position of strict atheism now at the other end of the spectrum we know way too much to commit to any particular religious story right so there are 2,000 religions on the globe and hat and has it's been pointed out by others that everyone already knows what it's like to be an atheist because all you need to do is look at someone else's religion and you say well that's patently ridiculous that you would believe in that and of course they're looking back at you and thinking the same thing so whenever I'm sitting next to somebody on an airplane I ask everybody if they've ever heard of the ultra-deep field experiment by the Hubble telescope so far nobody's heard of that but everybody is able to tell me all of the details of whatever cultural story they grew up on and you don't need to be an anthropologist to recognize that our nervous systems absorb whatever our cultures pour into us so if you grow up in Saudi Arabia you're going to love Islam and if you're born in Rome you love Catholicism in tel-aviv Judaism and Springfield Ohio Protestantism and it's not a coincidence that there's not a blossoming of Islam in Springfield Ohio and there's not a blossoming of Protestantism in in Mecca it's because we're products of our culture we accept whatever is poured into us right if there were one truth you would expect that it would spread everywhere evenly but clearly the data doesn't support that the crazy part is our culture's pour the stuff into us and then sometimes people are willing to fight and die over the particular stories Ralph Waldo Emerson pointed out awhile ago that the religious stories of one generation become the literary entertainment of the next generation and and you can see that nobody's fighting over Isis and Osiris anymore or the Greek and Roman Panna please not so much and so and so I want to give me an example this I don't know if any of you familiar with the the creation story of the baku ba kingdom in the congo but their creation story goes like this there was a white giant named mumble who had a sharp pain in his belly and he vomited up the earth and the sun and the moon and the stars i'm not making this up and then he had a second pain and he vomited up the animals and people and trees and included in that second ejection was and I quote the leopard the anvil the Eagle woman the monkey fumu firmament medicine man and lightning now if you find the creation story of the Baku ba and unlikely explanation for how we got here just keep in mind that if you were Baku Bo you would find equally bizarre the Western story of the naked couple in the talking reptile and the prohibited produce and if you were mokuba living in Kansas you would be fighting to get this in your children's textbooks now I'm not suggesting that the bukuvu story is wrong or the Adam and Eve story are wrong because there are competing stories I'm suggesting they're wrong because all the available evidence we can gather weighs against them so for example the the biblical story suggests that the earth is 6,000 years old our best science tells us that it's 4.5 billion years old so that means the biblical account has to somehow explain how the Japanese were making pottery 4,000 years before the earth existed so so for my money this puts me somewhere in the middle I have felt for a long time that we know too little to commit to strict atheism and we know far too much to commit to a particular religious story so what has surprised me is the amount of certainty that I find out there so when you walk into a bookstore what you find are the books by the neo atheist and the books by the fundamentally religious and they argue with each other and they polarize each other and they're spending all of their energies on that and it has felt to me for a while like maybe there should be another voice here because that seems too limited for a modern discussion because if you think about the space of possibilities right so take the whole judeo-christian Islamic tradition that's one point in the possibility space take the eastern lenders that's another point take the idea that we're mechanical pieces and parts and we shut off when we die that's another point we were planted here by space aliens taking another point right when you start when you start populating the space what you realize is they're vast landscapes in between of possibilities and all of these points are infinitesimally unlikely right but but together they add up to this possibility space and I feel like there's not really enough discussion about that space instead the whole discussion has been limited to what I consider perhaps a false dichotomy this God versus no God and that's where the conversation has ended now some people in the middle position sometimes people use the term agnostic I don't use that term because I the way I see it used it typically is used as a weak term often when people say they are agnostic what they mean is I'm not sure whether the guy with the beard on the cloud exists or doesn't exist right so I don't call myself an agnostic I call myself a possible in and the idea with possibility ISM is an active exploration of new ideas and a comfort with the scientific temperament of creativity and holding multiple hypotheses in mind so possibily anism is now 18 months old and I first announced it when I was on a live national interview on NPR I explained at night to find it and when I got done with the interview I got back in my truck and I drove over to my laboratory at Baylor College of Medicine where I'm a neuroscientist and I settle in for a day work and I opened up my email and I had hundreds of emails from people and they all said hey I think I'm a possibily into so I'm I'm I was pretty cool so I googled the word and it turns out the word didn't exist there were zero hits so I did what anybody would do I bought possibility comm and then and then I said then I waited to see what would happen well what happened has been amazing what happened his group started popping up all over the place on Facebook possibility groups got started the New York Times didn't article on MSNBC did an article on it spread worldwide the Uganda Times just had a beautiful piece on possibilities on the India Sunday Times there are now 15,000 Google hits and and it's really caught fire one thing I noticed that was funny is people who had heard about it on the radio didn't always know how to spell it or they forgot the name and so people started calling a possibility and also and all kinds of things and spelling it every way you can imagine and I thought you know what that's perfect that's right in the possibilities spirits but however you want to do it but the question start wondering about is why what is the reason that this movement is catching on given that it's a very strange movement in that we don't subscribe to anything so it struck me that maybe what's going on now that we've passed the first decade of this millennium I think maybe people are a little bit tired of people acting as though they're certain about things that they can't possibly be certain about so they're a little tired of the debates between Dawkins versus the Discovery Institute and as Voltaire said uncertainty is an uncomfortable position but certainty is an absurd position so I want to make two points of clarification about possibility ism so one is sometimes people come up to me after a talk and they say that's terrific that you're a possibility and I'm so glad that anything goes in possibility ISM because that means you get me in terms of ESP and crystals and whatever No possum million ism is not anything goes it's anything goes at first and then we import the tools of science to rule out parts of the possibilities space so it would be terrific if ESP existed we could all love that but to the extent that we can measure things now we cannot find any evidence to support and so the idea is you import the tools to sculpt to structure the possibility space you can rule out whole areas and the interesting part of possibility of possibility ISM really picks up where the toolbox of science leaves out it's where we no longer have the tools to address it and we have to understand the space of possibilities that's where it's really important and the reason it is so important to keep that open-mindedness about the all the parts we don't know is because we know for certain about the magnitude of things that we don't know so in every generation of scientists people have always felt that they have all the pieces and parts that they need in order to answer what's going on around them and the cosmos but just imagine trying to explain the Northern Lights in the absence of understanding the magnetosphere or trying to understand trying to explain the heart before the concept of a pump was invented I'm trying to understand how muscles work before the before electricity is discovered you would make theories but you would be doomed to be incorrect well we're in that same position now so we've got Newtonian physics and Einstein in physics and quantum mechanics and we think okay we sort of got all the pieces and parts but on the one hand there's all the the unknown unknowns all the stuff we don't even know we don't know but what I want to emphasize is all the stuff that we know for sure we don't know so take something like dark matter right so astrophysicists look at the movement of the planets in the galaxies and they look at everything moving around and they look at the gravitational pull and what they realize is something's missing there's something out there that we can't quite see or smell or touch but it must be there to make the equations work out to make the movements in the cosmos explain and so we're going to call this a fudge factor and we're going to call it dark matter and the idea is that dark matter the thing that we don't exactly know what it is but we require it to make the equations work out okay some of you may already know dark matter is not a tiny fudge factor 90% of the known universe is what we call dark matter that's a lot to sweep under the rug okay and this is what I study I go in a lab every day and study the human brain this is the most complicated device we have ever found in the universe it's essentially an alien kind of computational material and it is so dense in its connectivity that if you were to take a cubic millimeter of brain tissue there are more connections in there than there are stars in the Milky Way galaxy so this is incredibly complex and yet somehow this wet mechanical network system here is you it's all your hopes and dreams and aspirations right somehow that's you if you were to lose a little part of your pinky you wouldn't be any different but if you lose an equivalently sized piece of neural tissue that completely changes your conscious state right well the problem is we don't know how to take mechanical pieces and parts and build private subjective experience out of that imagine that I give you a trillion tinker toys and I said okay hook it up so this is a lever and this touches that and that causes that and so on at what point do you add one more tinker toy and then you say ah it's experiencing the taste of feta cheese now right that's the problem we don't know we don't have any way to take our equations and say okay well just carry the two and do a triple integral and then that's you know that's feta cheese or that's the redness of red or the qualia of pain or something we don't not only do not have a theory of how the brain works we don't even know what such a theory would look like okay so all of this calls for a bit of intellectual humility now I was giving this talk recently and then somebody came up to me afterwards and said hey dr. giggling good job on the talk he said you know what I think you should become a politician because you're unwilling to commit to anything and he said to me why don't you just cowboy up and and commit to something so I thought about that so in in Texas where I come from we have this lovely expression to cowboy up and what it means is to firmly commit to a decision and we really value the straiten people we like people who can firmly commit to decision so if you're trying to decide should I take the cattle out in the rain or should I marry this woman should I sell the ranch we we like people who can make a really firm decision but what I'm going to suggest is that there are some domains where it's appropriate to cowboy up and there are some domains where it's not so appropriate so would you stop a guy on a ranch and say tell me if you think there are extraterrestrial civilizations do you care what his opinion is would you value it more than say an astrobiologist and if you wouldn't ask him about extraterrestrial civilizations that suggests that there are some domains in which it is not appropriate to commit and act like you know the answer in the absence of having good evidence so the next time someone says to you to cowboy up and commit to a decision I suggest that you tell them no I would rather geek out and the idea of geeking out is having a creativity for new narratives and a comfort level with holding multiple possibilities in mind and you should feel free to cite the gospel of science the most important three words that science ever gave to humankind so my message to you is this when you leave here and you go back out into this strange world try to seek comfort with having multiple narratives and and uncertainty and this is not just a plea for simple open mindedness but for an active exploration of new ideas I think this is important for our education for our legislation for perhaps the future of our warfare so when you leave PopTech full of ideas go back and look around the strange world you're in and see if you can live a life that is free from dogma and full of awe and wonder and see if you can celebrate possibility and praise uncertainty thank you very much"

Take,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhHnP8ON5G8,0,565071,3807,173,1081,YhHnP8ON5G8,he shoots about forty three forty four percent from ten to fifteen from ten to sixteen foot range or whatever this was last year coming into this year this she's averaging twenty six got the numbers right in front of me twenty six points 13 rebounds we know what kind of a stud he is there is no doubt about that but the flip side is this when you look at the Philadelphia 76ers with the combination of a JJ Redick now that Mark Hill folks is not playing with Ben Simmons being limited in his shooting ability but the playmaking extraordinaire that he is you have JJ Redick and Jimmy Butler that's going to score now Jimmy Butler is not a spot-up shooter he can't hit spot-up shots but he will take the ball to the hole he will dribble penetrate your drive he will make things happen Brett Brown is trying to figure that out the reason why I blame both of them is this you are Jo Ellen beat as much as you chirp and as great as your game is you can score from anywhere against anybody nobody forced you to shoot those threes you chose to nobody forces you to get the ball in the post he can get the ball in the post he could get the ball 12 feet away from the basket will almost religiously he will spin and pivot facing the basket because he is not a comfortable back to the basket player how do I notice the Boston Celtics told me this last year when they were playing against him in the postseason Brett Brown was calling plays feeding into that Brett Brown to me one of the impediments and I liked him as a coach and I was supportive of him getting this contract extension my issue with Brett Brown he is not forceful enough in my estimation when it comes to insisting that Joe L&B be a man down in that paint area and dominate the way that he's capable of doing he'll get his numbers but how he gets his numbers are considerably softer than they should be because he should I'm not talking about breakaway dogs drive it to the basket Duncan or shoot mid-range shots I'm talking about playing with your back to the basket drop step and be a male yeah that's what I'm talking to ask you to question who's the best player in the Philadelphia 76er lambi is he being used in the way the best maximizes his abilities right now no all right then and I'm saying that's not that's bolted in my fault that's what I that's all jewel and beat is saying hey all he's saying is the way this system is set up right now it's not hasn't played to his strengths and his capabilities therefore his game is not showing you its full bloom its full blossom we've seen in Mali so right off the point totals are down shooting percentage is down and Joyland beat is telling you why I think we need to be really clear by the way Amina's not blaming the trade 8 ways he's saying it's a symptom of the adjustments we've made since the trade but he doesn't he doesn't look back on ago I wish we had to trade for Butler he's real clear about that it's not Butler's fault not done with drugs on something both of you actually because I was watching this game last night they beat Detroit right watch the game last night yes and then he makes the comments on his day off after they win okay don't you think that looks a little bit fish no it does not because the what he made the comments they had asked him about it and so he was responding to them and then they wanted to piggyback off of it again and get more into it so he was trying to clarify his position because obviously he had to have a conversation because Brett brown so it was initial comment and and definitely went to him but to get back to your point what I'm saying to you is this you have Joella being yes that very system that you're lamenting yeah that wasn't the problem with Jimmy Butler was did last year but what Joel embiid still can't play G where there wasn't there when he wasn't the I apologize when he wasn't there what I'm saying to you is joylyn beads preference is to face the basket and shoot or go around you as opposed to be physical and B that's why Jack came on my radio show last week I said yeah but you just said the system is not maximizing in beats capabilities right now the system they're playing today yeah right not maximizing but what I'm saying is Brett Brown is not forcing him to get in the post you're the coach get him down there and beat is saying something essentially similar to you he's saying I'm being used as a stretch 5 it's not where I should be you but he wouldn't be the same but last year when he had the opportunity to be that guy he preferred to do that and somehow Brett Brown relented according to what my I saw there were many times where I saw Joel embiid asking for the ball with his back to the basket he'd get it and spin and face the basket and try to triple well if you a minute to do it will Kane is on the basketball court a 6 feet tall but this 7 1 7 to do is gonna dribble the ball what are you gonna do you'll try to strap him before he gets to the hole because you know he has no big dribbling but so much all I was gonna ask is they're clearly better with Jimmy Butler Josh so what's the solution here with him being it's not just about whether or not if you're if if the discussion is about are the six is better there's nothing to talk about yeah the reason why JoEllen beads words matter so much he's giving you the impression if we want to compete for a title there are certain things that have to be done and right and he's right and he's we do and I agree there but I'm saying to you he is choosing to play a certain style as to his detriment and Brett Brown is not forcing him on enough to do the right thing fine yeah well that's what I'm saying on you shut it Joe and beat agrees with you apparently based upon these comments he agrees with you JoEllen beat is the Sixers best player them to go to their full potential he's gonna have to reach his full potential the team cannot be centered around Jimmy Butler and it can't be sitting around Bill Ben Simmons because Ben Simmons is gonna be able to shoot enough to keep you in the games how about this to win the game for you when you need to win the game JoEllen beat is gonna have to figure out how to fit in a system that includes Jimmy Bowen that's on JoEllen beat as a winner he has to figure that out but he's right Brett Brown has to put him in a position to be the best player on the floor Brett Brown has to create a system around him bead that actually encourages and maybe the answer is what you're saying put him down on the block put him in the paint I'm not an john biebe it seems to be agreeing with you I'm so me out here standing at of shooting threes you're absolutely right but it there's no argument there but what I'm saying to you is that even when you put him down there he makes a choice and I'm saying I'm not telling him to live in a post I'm saying show versatility in your game this planta listen Shaq äj-- Kobe could shoot Jays but clearly he wants to go to the hole as well what Shaq was down there clogging up the lane you know Shaq wasn't gonna shoot any threes MJ could do whatever you wanted to do Scotty Pittman was in the junction he could hit some J's but he was going to go to the hole there are ways to work around this but JoEllen bead has to elevate his level of versatility he's got to play with his back to the basket better I'm not saying to live in himself to that keep the Arsenal that you have but you have to add back to the basket capability it helps pace it slows down the game when you need it to because their bench is not that deep that's important it gets them to the free-throw line we he can hit some shots whatever these are the kind of things that he has to do in order for the sixes to be better sounds like he's ready to do him let's see based on what he said it sounds like she's ready let's see

 part one of a series where I analyze and uncover the production of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001
 A Space Odyssey. For a long time now, 2001 has been at the top of my list of all time
 favorite movies. Why? Because I’ve found it to be the most thought provoking movie
 I’ve ever seen and despite inspiring a vast collection of filmmakers and their projects,
 it remains the most unique movie I’ve ever seen. To me, this movie sits
 comfortably in a category of its own. There is 2001 and then there are all other movies.
 As an aspiring filmmaker, I’ve sought an answer to the question: How did Kubrick make
 this film? After a month of research, I managed to peel
 back the curtain just a bit to peek at the genius of its construction. 2001 A Space Odyssey was directed by Stanley
 Kubrick and written by Kubrick and British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. The
 screenplay was inspired by Clarke’s short story titled The Sentinel, which is similar
 to the Floyd section of the film. In an interview with  physics professor Jeremy Bernstein, Kubrick
 estimates  just how much time was spent writing the screenplay. Stanley Kubrick: “The thing that uh, does
 take all the time is to extract  say, two hours and fifteen minutes of a story. And really
 keep distilling and distilling and distilling and distilling and distilling, uh, I would
 say that, um, if you count the time that’s spent during the shooting day, also working
 on the story— in rehearsal and rewriting it and so forth— I would say that an average
 of at least four hours a day has been spent on this story. Much more than that because
 in the real solid writing period it was like eight hours a day. But let’s just say that
 it averaged four hours a day for two years. Say an average of six days a week. That’s
 twenty-four hours a week times, uh, maybe a hundred weeks. I’d say that’s a good,
 uh, twenty-four hundred hours spent on, call it two hours and forty minutes of story. So
 that’s about a, a thousand to one, isn’t it?” We start at the beginning of the film, but
 in fact, this was the end of production. The Dawn of Man sequence was shot after all the
 other scenes were wrapped. The establishing landscape shots were actually still photographs
 done by a second unit in Africa. Because Kubrick had a phobia of flying in airplanes, despite
 having a pilot’s license, he directed the second unit on what to capture via the telephone. Kier Dullea: “And he had a graph with 1,
 2, 3, 4, 5, 6… going up the left-hand side of the graph and A, B, C, D, E, F, G… going
 off the top of the graph and he was on a direct telephone connection with these still photographers
 and he’d say, uh, ‘Okay, Joe, um, the mountain range should start- you’ve got
 it at 3B change it so now 4M.’” These images would come in to play later on
 in the soundstage. The shots involving the apes were filmed on
 Soundstage 3 at MGM Borhamwood in England. nearby. It consists of ten enormous soundstages
 concealed in industrial-looking shops, paint shops, office units, and so on. Behind the
 buildings is a huge lot covered with bits and pieces of other productions… Kubrick’s
 offices are near the front of the complex in a long bungalow structure that houses,
 in addition to his production staff, a group of youthful model-makers working on large,
 very detailed models of spacecraft to be used in special-effects photography: Kubrick calls
 their realm ‘Santa’s Workshop’” (Making 63). It is possible that it wasn’t always the
 plan to shoot the Dawn of Man sequence in the studio. While going over information earlier
 in the production on “the average temperature and rainfall all over the globe at every season
 of the year,” Kubrick was quoted saying, “We’re looking for a cool desert where
 we can shoot some sequences during the late spring… We’ve got our eye on a location
 in Spain, but it might be pretty hot to work in comfortably, and we might have trouble
 controlling the lighting. If we don’t go to Spain, we’ll have to build an entirely
 new set right here” (Making 66). And they did. The plate glass photos that were captured
 by the second unit in Africa made up the background of these shots. How it was done was the photos
 were made into 8 by 10 inch Ektachrome transparencies and using a special projector they were projected
 from the front onto a highly reflective screen that was 40 feet by 90 feet. Large-scale front
 projection hadn’t been done before. At the time, this was actually the largest front
 projector ever made. Normally, projections like this would be done from behind the screen,
 but the light that was reflected onto the rest of the set and the actors was weak enough
 not to be visible (Making 83). The projector projected the image into an
 angled two-way mirror with the camera on the other side recording the image from behind
 the two-way mirror. This way the camera would record at the exact angle that the image is
 being projected from, which would hide any shadows cast by the actors onto the projection
 screen. To make sure nothing got onto the mirror,
 the camera operator would wear a surgical mask while shooting. Here you can see an ape brush past the projection screen causing it to move slightly.  The projected image doesn’t show up on him and his body perfectly hides the shadow he casts.  The fun-with-kubrick tumblr noticed that this still image in particular was used as the background  in several shots—sometimes flipped. If you look closely, you can see the similar cloud pattern. In an interview for American Cinematographer,
 special effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull details what went into creating this effect: “To camouflage the varying light transmission
 rates between rolls of the front projection screen material on the giant 40- by 90-foot
 screen, the material was cut up into small, irregular pieces and pasted up at random so
 that slight variations in the transmission rates would merge with cloud shapes or be
 lost altogether in brilliant sunlight effects” (American Cinematographer). You can see some of the imperfections of the
 projection screen on some of the closer shots in the Blu-ray version if you look hard enough. “Since the screen occupied an entire wall
 of the stage, and the front-projection rig was delicate and cumbersome, the sets were
 built on a giant rotating platform which covered most of the stage floor. Widely varying camera
 angles could then be obtained with no movement of the screen, and little movement of the
 projection rig” (American Cinematographer). This “zebra” was actually a dead horse
 that was painted to look like a zebra. Because they were using a live leopard in the film
 they had tranquilizer guns on hand in case anything happened. It has been said the horse
 smelled really bad during the filming of this shot and the crewmembers were not happy (Making
 76). The tranquilizers did get some use as this
 tapir was knocked out in order to look dead during the meat-eating scene (Making 69). The apes were played by mimes. Dan Richter,
 who played Moon-Watcher (the ape that discovers that a bone can be used as a weapon, was given
 a camera by Kubrick to go film apes in the zoo to study movement and behavior. Dan Richter: “What I was looking for was
 always people I could, I could get to act a little bit because I understood that the
 movement wasn’t the solution. The solution was to motivate the movement.” hips so that when they wore the costumes of
 hair they wouldn’t look bulky and like men stuffed in gorilla suits. It was an extremely
 complex task to produce apelike masks with delicate articulation for bearing fangs, snarling,
 eating, drinking. (A company that manufactured artificial limbs was contracted to produce
 a long-fingered, narrow apelike hand, which could be operated remotely by the actor’s
 hand within the sleeve of a longer arm. This failed to look convincing and was abandoned.)
 Facial makeup was created by making a plastic substructure skull with hinged jaw. A fine
 rubber mold was made with the equivalent of skin on the face; hair was added as one would
 put hair on a wig. Movement in the lips was achieved by having false tongue and false
 teeth and an arrangement of toggles that the actors could move with their tongues and that
 allowed the lips to curl left, right, or both directions. The eyes were the actors’: the
 mask was made right up to the eyelids” (Making 81). As you can see, the precise lighting gives
 the set a very theatrical quality. Remember how Kubrick was concerned about having control
 of the lighting? Well, “fifteen hundred individually controlled lamps were on the
 ceiling of the sound stage” (Making 81). Naturally, this made the set very hot.
 Dan Richter discusses the harsh conditions on set in an interview for Cinetropolis. He
 said, “With the front projection system the demands of lighting to get the proper
 match and color temperatures right meant that the temperatures were sometimes over a hundred
 on the set. We had medical personal standing by and compressed air to be blasted into our
 costumes the moment Stanley called cut. The union also limited the time we could have
 the masks on. I and Richard Woods, who played One-Ear, had full contact lenses to color
 our eyes for close ups which got very painful as the dust rose” (Cinetropolis). All of the ape sounds were recorded by Richter
 and his actors as well. (Cinetropolis) In this picture, you can see one of the apes
 taking a break. There is a pipe in his mouth to hold the jaw of the mask open so he could
 breathe easier because the elastic made the mouth close automatically (Making 75). In the same interview, Richter talks about
 filming the Leopard attack. “The stunt man Terry Duggan, who worked for the Chipperfields,
 was practicing play fighting with a lion and a leopard. Stanley in the end went
 with the leopard. Stanley had a cage built around him, the camera, and the crew. We put
 Terry in a man-ape suit and I got between him and the background man-apes. On the first
 take the leopard, confused and nervous, went for me and Terry tackled him before he reached
 me. The second take worked” (Cinetropolis). Two baby chimpanzees were used during production
 that “had to be prodded by their trainer The monolith was originally going to be a
 tetrahedron, but as Special Effects Supervisor Con Pederson said: “The tetrahedron didn’t
 look monumental or simple or fundamental. It tended to express diminution more than
 impressive scale. And there would be people who would think of pyramids.” (Making 76) This monolith was twelve feet long and it
 was made of wood covered in black paint. It was also going to have another function: Arthur C. Clarke: “In fact, our original
 idea was to have something with a transparent screen on which images would appear, which
 would teach the apes, you know, how to fight each other, maybe even make fire, but that
 was much too naïve an idea.” Now, the best we can hope to achieve is to
 recognize the choices that Kubrick made and of course we can only speculate as to why
 these choices were made. Considering the fact that this sequence was shot after the rest
 of the production was completed, it allowed for a better understanding of the overall
 look of the film. Although it is also imaginable that the choices made here were due to production
 constraints. Every time they wanted to shoot a new angle, they had to rotate the set so
 they may use that massive projection screen. What is interesting here is that the entire
 sequence seems to be made up primarily of static shots. There is the occasional very
 subtle movement, but no dolly or tracking shots, only slight pans and tilts. The establishing
 landscape shots are static (obviously, because they were still images). The theatrical lighting
 and composition of the shots almost seems to evoke an image of a museum diorama or zoo
 habitat. You’ll also notice the substantial use of long shots, which seems to lend itself
 nicely to the diorama idea. Whereas it is possible that this choice was made simply
 to make use of the full scope of the set, some have speculated that this is to make
 the audience feel like observers rather than participants and allow them to watch the apes
 much in the same way the alien presence did. And since the Dawn of Man sequence was shot
 last, it is conceivable that the “habitat look” was meant to mirror the final sequence
 of the film in which Dave Bowman finds himself in a habitat of his own. It is questionable
 whether or not all this was intended or simply necessary due to the inability to shoot on
 location. Let’s look at the initial meeting between
 the ape tribes. The two tribes meet on either side of a watering hole. The shot list seems
 to be made up of mostly long shots from either side facing each tribe. We’ve established
 that there was only one projection screen and the set was on a turntable, so each view
 we see is of the set rotated 180 degrees. We never get a shot from the side showing
 both tribes on either side of the frame. Now, it looks as if these large rock formations
 would have prevented a clear shot had the set been rotated 90 degrees. That said, Kubrick
 could very well have brought the camera closer to shoot from the side. Instead, we get a
 reverse shot with a foreground layer of the backs of the apes looking at the tribe that
 we are looking at to make the meeting make sense without an establishing shot from the
 side. What I’m getting at is—it seems as though the physical location of the camera
 never crosses on to the set. Even the closer shots appear to be shot from far away with
 a telephoto lens—see how the apes closest to the camera seem to pass in front with relative
 ease. The question is—did the set constrain the production and reduce the possible choice
 of shots or did shooting from outside the set purposefully lend itself to the constructed
 habitat idea? The camera does cross onto the set directly
 after this scene for the night scene and the scene with the monolith. Although, only two
 of these shots feature the projection screen. For the most part, nearly every shot in the
 Dawn of Man sequence features the projection screen. There are the long shots of:
 the watering hole, the flat walled off space, and the shelter space where the monolith appears.
 Then, there are some closer shots that seem to take place very close to the projection
 screen, this one is a little further back – possibly to transition from the still
 establishing shots, and a few medium close-ups shots without the screen visible. So, why does the Dawn of Man sequence work? You’ll also notice that the Dawn of Man
 sequence lacks any dialogue whatsoever—it is for all intents and purposes, a silent
 film. It works really well as an opening to the film because it is a very simple and direct
 story told completely visually that perfectly sets up the concept and the overall theme
 of the film— a man-ape tribe tries to survive on limited food and water, there is a confrontation
 between two tribes over ownership of a watering hole, a mysterious object appears before one
 of the tribes and gives them inspiration for the first use of a weapon to kill animals
 for meat and to reclaim their resources giving their tribe strength and power. Despite the
 relatively simple story, the way it was shot stimulates our intellect upfront by lacking
 very many close ups. The use of many long shots and medium shots with several subjects
 inhabiting the frame stimulates the audience’s mind by forcing them to choose what to look
 at and what to notice as opposed to a close up, which directs the audience’s attention
 to something specific. This way, the audience is required to become more active and engage
 with the story. There are points of specific action to lead the viewer’s attention, but
 there are also several shots that are purely observational. Even some of the pivotal scenes
 contain a variety of shots that don’t favor any one character in particular. This perfectly
 introduces the pacing for the following section— our introduction to space. And the story is
 propelled forward by the intrigue and mystery of the monolith that links the sections together. I feel that the way the entire Dawn of Man
 sequence was staged and shot meshes very well with the rest of the film and it seems that
 the cohesiveness would have been lost had they shot on location with potentially more
 freedom. There was one shot however, that was filmed
 outside of the soundstage and that is the shot where Moonwatcher uses the bone to crush
 the skull. The sky in this shot is real. Richter performed this scene on a platform outside
 most likely so that they could shoot the extreme low-angle and not have to worry about lights
 getting in the shot (Cinetropolis). It was reportedly after this scene was shot
 that Kubrick got the idea to do the graphic match-cut of the bone in the air with the
 nuclear satellite. Arthur C. Clarke: “Stanley was walking back
 to the studio and he had a broomstick and he was throwing this broomstick up in the
 air and I was quite worried that it might come down on him. And I think that was when
 he got the idea of this transition, which is of course what happened. The bone goes
 up and turns into what is supposed to be an orbiting space bomb—a weapon in space. Although
 that isn’t made clear. You just assume it’s some kind of space vehicle and there’s a
 three million year jump cut.” Thanks for watching. You can find the links

moonlanding,"Just one minute away from landing, both of this planes engines suddenly fail. #planecrash

From: TERROR IN THE SKIES: Technical Meltdown
http://bit.ly/X6dxc6",How to Land a Boeing 777 without Any Engines,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTenuYvaz8w,0,4502479,10686,706,2064,nTenuYvaz8w,"NARRATOR: January 17, 2008,
 British Airways flight 38, a Boeing 777, is
 approaching Heathrow after an overnight
 flight from Beijing. It's just one minute
 away from landing. Sculptor Paul
 Stafford is returning home from a business trip. PAUL STAFFORD: It's the end of
 quite a long, boring flight. We've been flying for just
 over 11 hours from Beijing. I've been doing work for
 the university interviewing postgraduate students. It's all very ordinary. NARRATOR: But it's soon
 going to be very unordinary. Just 60 seconds from landing,
 the engines suddenly fail. Captain Ian Hollingworth
 takes us through the events in a simulator. IAN HOLLINGWORTH: They're
 now in the final stages the airplane on the ground. So they're making sure that
 all the checks are complete. The captain, certainly,
 is making sure that everything's fine,
 the undercarriage down, final flap selected. The landing check's complete. They've been given
 landing clearance. It's only in the last 50
 seconds or so that things start to go badly awry for this crew. NARRATOR: At 750 feet, both
 engines suddenly lose power. IAN HOLLINGWORTH:
 Captain will look across at the engine instrumentation. There's not enough power
 coming from those engines. They're getting very low. They're getting very
 low on speed, as well. NARRATOR: At 600 feet,
 both engines fail. The aircraft's speed
 drops dangerously low. The pilots have less
 than 30 seconds to react. IAN HOLLINGWORTH: Captain
 looks around to see what on earth is going on. The fuel system's in
 the correct position. The fuel control switch
 is in the right place. Everything looks normal. NARRATOR: But it's not. The pilot is fast losing any
 ability to control the plane. It begins to fall through
 the sky, lifting the nose. He has moments to make a
 life or death decision. IAN HOLLINGWORTH: As
 the nose begins to rise and the speed begins
 to drop right off, it becomes apparent
 that they're not going to be able to make the runway. NARRATOR: 10 seconds
 before landing, even if they can't
 make the runway, they have to get over
 the boundary fence. The captain needs to extend
 his glide as much as he can. He raises the flaps,
 streamlining the wings. IAN HOLLINGWORTH: The captain
 brings the flap up to 25. The copilot lowers the nose. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. NARRATOR: It's only
 three seconds to impact. Captain Burkill's been so
 busy, it's his first chance to warn air traffic control. IAN HOLLINGWORTH: Push this
 forward on the control column to try to recover from
 an impending stall. Airplane crashes. NARRATOR: Flight BA38 slams
 down just short of the runway.  The oxygen masks come
 down in front of me, all over the plane in front of me. The overhead lockers are open. Everyone's belongings
 start to fly out. The plane's hurtling forward. And I'm hitting my head
 on the front of the seat. And my foot's hit
 the back of the seat. And I'm being thrown around. And I've no idea
 what's going on. It seems to last maybe
 eight, nine, ten seconds, and we shudder to a halt. IAN HOLLINGWORTH:
 They land the airplane just over the
 threshold of runway 27 left, away from any
 of the built-up areas. And they survive. They survive because they did
 an absolutely brilliant job. NARRATOR: It was thanks to
 the pilot's quick thinking that he managed to give the
 plane a critical extra 164 feet of glide path. As emergency services
 arrive, passengers bail out of the stricken plane. One of the rescuers
 films the aftermath. PAUL STAFFORD: And
 it's all very calm. It's curious. I walk away from the airplane,
 maybe 100 yards, 120 yards. And I turn around, and I see
 this great big modern airplane, this 777, smashed to
 pieces on the floor. NARRATOR: 47 people
 were injured. But thanks to the
 crew's fast maneuvering, there were no fatalities."
moonlanding,Produced by NASA Television,NASA Remembers Neil Armstrong,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pQKZc2AXW0,-1,292974,3428,126,169,1pQKZc2AXW0,I can recall quite vividly when the nine of us met for the first time we were told to go down to sign in under the name of max Peck and it turned out that all night of us signed in under the name of Max Peck then there was this young fellow that I said you know we introduced each other and he was a fellow buddy man Neil Armstrong and I said well I were you in the are you in the Navy or the Air Force he says no I I work for NASA I thought oh boy we got a ringer here it's going to be a tough battle to get a flight off with Neil aboard but he turned out to be a team player a real great guy and as we know from you know the history of what went on after that after people had looked up for tens of thousands of years and wondered what was up there Neil was the first person to ever make a footprint on some place other than Earth I told Neil once that I'm not a very jealous person but for him I'll make an exception on that one that first step on the moon was really something he always had car troubles and he drove out one time and had one of his cars and had quit working out at work so we got barred a tow rope from the maintenance people and I hooked it up to my station wagon and up to his car and I told him into Lancaster at about 70 miles an hour I could see him shaking his fist at me know when to Politan we went to the moon to I I like to tell Neal and always did remind him that Apollo 10 we painted the white line in the sky so we wouldn't get lost so all he'd have to do is worry about that little thing about landed I got to see him at the Congressional Gold medal ceremony back in November we got him to a restaurant and he spent time with general Stafford Gene Cernan the Collins and they got the laugh and joke I mean I was sitting out in the car waiting for him so I could get him back to the hotel and I had to finally go in there because I saw the the rest were closing down and they were all in there just laughing and getting I had to go in and put my hands on my hips and say okay fellas it's time to go you know and Neil came out he's how we're gonna dance on the street and I said no we're not dances preach one I gotta gonna be no he always came away from a conversation with Neal thinking that he wants you to be the important person not himself in this in this encounter and so yeah it was a delight to talk to everybody like Neal he was quiet he was a man of many talents he was also a good friend I always think of yellow as a friend and it's just too bad he's gone but looked himself as being a a as being sort of out on the tip of the spear if you will and there were just a lot of thousands of people there were designers and engineers and and people who made made it possible for him to be out there doing what what he did and no one can take away anything from that but he saw himself as the results of the work of a great team of people Neal was sincere he always always felt and said that you know it's not about me it's about those other five hundred thousand people who made it possible for me to do what we did what he did you know he always considered himself the tip of the arrow on the strengthen the bow was he an American people who made it possible I often use Neil as a guide when things are getting a little bit crazy and I think okay we got to stick to the science we got to stick to the engineering that's the most important and try and avoid the hype and Neil was very good at avoiding the hype you know he was very much the straight shooter you know let's get the job done and he carried that into his professional life and as far as you know we could see from the outside his personal life it never was about him he I don't think I was even in his vocabulary it was about the team the mission the job that it had to be done and don't focus a attention on me focus it on on the product and in and the end accomplishments that you want to get out of this activity and it's sort of the old as long as everybody pulls on the rope in the same direction you know you can move mountains he was that kind of guy look at the Apollo 11 mission patch he was commander that mission and as as it went back then the astronauts designed their mission emblem and and there was one for every mission that particular mission patch look at it closely there's no astronaut names on it why is there no astronaut names on it well the word at the time was because the commander of the mission who has 51% of the vote what goes on the patch didn't want the astronauts to get credit for our country being the first to land on the moon he wanted our nation to get credit for it so no names on the patch there's an eagle there of course representing the strength of our country but the eagle is not carrying arrows in a form of arrogance or military it's carrying an olive branch for peace and and to me that that kind of represents the personality of Neil in life it it seems like when we lose something God has a way of replacing it with something in and while there is no comparison whatsoever between curiosity and Neil Armstrong it is a second wave of explorers beyond low-earth orbit and so it did worry me that you know here's this this new Explorer and I sure hope I hope it's not replacing you know the icon so he just wanted to know that other kids could it could be inspired not just only by his accomplishments but by the accomplishments of a country the impossible is possible all you got to do is go on and do it I'm Neil Armstrong I was the first human being on another planet this universe if I can do it why can't you do it now how's the 18 year old a 16 year old a 25 year old going to argue with Neil Armstrong he wanted to inspire these young people to dream and his desire was to spire these dreamers to dream on to take us back again when no man has been before I think if it Neil would certainly find peace within himself to know and I think he did to know that he is deed inspire this generation I could see it in her eyes I could see it in their hearts by standing in front of these kids and saying hi I'm Neil Armstrong bingo there's nothing they can't do well Neil Armstrong and the early astronauts were really the pioneers of exploration that for the first time all of us could see it as it was happening when I think of something like Lewis and Clark you you took weeks to hear about what happened with exploration but for this generation of explorers we could experience it and we could see ourselves doing things that no one had ever before and I was eight years old watching Neil and Buzz walk on that the moon the first time and it did seem to me at that point that I could do anything and I'm not sure if they hadn't done it I would have grown up thinking of I hope in some way that who he really was can be captured for people so that future generations could profit from him because if we had a role model Neil was one of our best role models whether it was going into space or being an engineer or being a successful businessman or anything like that that his approach of being quiet not assuming but accomplishing things I think that is something of his legacy that young people would appreciate we all lost a piece of ourselves today all of us who consider ourselves explorers I've often wondered if during these passing years when Neil looked up at the beautiful moon he thought hmm been there done that and I believe God sent Neil here to do what he needed to do and once his assignment was up then God called him back home and so I'm really thankful and glad for that you
moonlanding,"Mach 5 aircraft technology would enable flight times of 4.5 hours from Europe to Australia. CNBC goes behind the scenes with the latest innovators to find out more

Subscribe to CNBC International: http://bit.ly/1eiWsDq

Teams in Oxford, U.K., and Boston, U.S., are working on new designs for plane engines, with the potential to create a ""very high-speed aircraft"" and take fuel out of the equation altogether. CNBC takes a look at both options.

Scimitar is a prototype jet engine from UK-based Reaction Engines. Developers tell CNBC that the experimental apparatus can extend the speed, the power, and the range of existing systems by up to 5 times the speed of sound.

Researchers from MIT are working on developing technology they hope will completely rethink aviation propulsion altogether, using an ion thruster. CNBC takes a closer look.

 and improve there is still one component that even the largest aircraft
 manufacturers admit is crucial to the future of the industry engines we have ever-more fuel-efficient aircraft and that counts for the airlines obviously for the probability of the airlines which is usually very shallow It is no
 surprise then that engine industry leaders from GE to
 Rolls-Royce and Pratt & Whitney are all vying for business from plane
 manufacturers but the allure of a multi-million dollar contract has also
 attracted some newcomers looking to propel the industry forward
 in some rather innovative ways This is Scimitar, a prototype jet
 engine from UK-based group Reaction Engines Its developers say the
 experimental apparatus can extend the speed the power and the range of existing systems by up
 to 5 times the speed of sound all by tackling the biggest barrier to
 a new generation of ultra-fast aircraft engines: heat The fundamentals of jet engine
 technology haven't changed much from the original 1930s design air is drawn into the front of the jet
 where it's compressed mixed with a fuel like high octane
 kerosene and ignited but in many cases engine temperatures
 can reach up to 2,000 degrees Celsius something which pushes the structural
 integrity of the aircraft to its limits Scimitar is designed to change all of
 that We are in the process of testing a very
 very important development in aerospace propulsion which is a pre-cooler a device for cooling the air entering the high speed
 engine so that the engine can continue to operate pretty much as normal This means that we're going to be able to fly at speeds of Mach 5 pretty easily in the future  The company
 is now engaged in a fifty-percent EU-funded project called LAPCAT Long-term Advanced Propulsion Concepts and Technologies a study designed to examine the propulsion concepts and technologies required to create a hypersonic aircraft
 with a flight range near to 20 thousand kilometers It enables very high speed terrestrial aircraft so for example a aircraft carrying 300 passengers could go from Europe to Australia in about four hours, four and a half hours,  we're looking at a revolution in transportation equivilant to the jet engine  With partnerships to
 commercialize the technology underway the program has even given
 birth to a bigger development a synergistic air-breathing rocket
 engine or SABRE for short This innovative
 concept engine promises to propel the ultimate flight a single-stage earth to orbit craft designed for space
 travel But what if heat and fossil fuels could
 be removed from an engine's equation altogether? Researchers from MIT are
 working on developing technology they hope will completely rethink
 aviation propulsion altogether This is an Ion thruster it might look like something from
 science fiction and it's not necessarily far from it the thruster operates using a ring of
 magnets to electrically charge atoms within an engine's combustion
 chamber propelling the craft forward but charging these atoms requires large
 amounts of electricity with most organizations considering it
 unviable for terrestrial aircraft until now In 2013 MIT found ionic thrusters may be a far more
 efficient source of propulsion than conventional jet engines  the MIT
 team says there's still a lot of work needed to figure out the best way to
 store the voltage required for ionic thrusters but the
 hope is one day they might just be turning science
 fiction into science fact"

lights camera hoaxes in light of the new Star Wars movie let's go out of our way to explore a little space the final frontier though America did claim to have done some of this exploring by land on the moon in 1969 there is intense deliberation as to the legitimacy of this event maybe after these reasons you'll start thinking that's no moon anyways in space at least this solar system there's only one light source available the Sun using basic lighting knowledge all the shadows should fall in the same direction since all the light comes from one direction basic stuff but to the misfortune of NASA in photos it's really really clear that the shadows go in different directions offering a strong case against the truth of the moon landing it is very plausible that there were actually multiple different lights showing that there was more to this event than what they've been telling us explanations include hills on the moon's surface causing reflections of light making discrepancies in the shadows despite that the evidence is extremely controversial it just doesn't make sense that the shadows would be that different but I mean I'm no scientist number nine that's rad to reach the moon first you have to pass through the Van Allen radiation belt doesn't sound as exciting as a meteor belt but it's hundreds of times more dangerous to travel through it it would take a serious amount of armor plating to withstand lethal doses of radiation rad aways don't exist here so this is a big problem nASA says that they've had enough aluminium plate encoding in the interior and exterior of the ship to provide adequate protection to the astronauts plus they say that the time spent there was so short that the radiation could not possibly have accumulated enough to kill them well after spending billions of dollars trying to put people on the moon you would think that they would have thought this through already they must have some top-secret materials we still don't know about number eight like a waving flag anyway is one of the first photos of the moon landing showed a puzzling image to viewers people notice that the American flag rippled as if there was a breeze this is problematic since there should be no wind on the moon to cause this effect this is one of the initial arguments for a faith moon landing NASA is gone to disprove this claim by responding that the flag was stored in a tube which rippled from the force of being put down into the floor by the astronaut while air does not exist on the moon action-reaction still works like normal this seems to be a plausible explanation but I mean what would a famous American event be without a waving flag anyways number seven what a Sirach one of the most famous photos supports the fake moon landing argument is the c-loc the photo shows a rock on the ground of the perfectly symmetrical sea and graben side it's likely that people assumed that this was a label for a prop rock they use in the filming and that they forgot to put it down in the correct way it's very difficult for something like this to happen in nature so it provides some pretty substantial evidence for monkey business even so taking into account that the film was developed manually and not digitally stored back then it's possible that there was just an error in the development of the film with someone's hair falling on it or someone intentionally riding on it as a joke this was a flub by the prop crew though I wonder where the guy is working now number six UFO reflections can often reveal things that don't want to be seen that's why spies and intelligence officers often recommend checking your six by looking at mirrors of cars and store windows while you're trying to be stealthy but I'm going off-topic now anyways one of the photos the reflection shows an object suspended in the sky that has never been explained it's terrible quality as per usual but people compare it to the studio light nothing on the lunar lander really resembles this object also so really don't know what it is it's probably aliens though right come on let's be real here number five crater face Jets are powerful powerful machines and being so they should leave an impact crater on the surface when they touch down right as the moon is supposed to be layered with dust there should be some telling of a landing however photos of the landing do not show any visible crater underneath the landing module this convinces people that I was simply placed on the surface NASA retorts that simply would not make sense that they fired a module with astronauts on it fast enough to create an impact crater make sense to me too instead they say that the module was used with significantly lower thrust than what people think and when it landed on the solid rock surface of the Moon it would not made sense for it to be a substantial mark like an impact crater after all they want to land not destroy the moon like the asteroid and Armageddon number four slow-mo guys when computers came out people were able to analyse conspiracies in much greater detail than ever before just think about the JFK assassination and imagine how many times people have played that clip over and over again so they can milk everything they could out of it people did the same for the film from the moon landing if you increase the speed by two and a half times astronauts move exactly like they would if there's normal gravity this is slightly suspicious to people but they continue to picket the authenticity by pointing out possible hidden wires and cables that could have helped them jump great heights photos are incredibly hazy and low-quality few people actually believe these theories but you're welcome to sit there with a magnifying glass going frame by frame if you want number three no Star Wars is really not that much in space if you think about it I mean it is called space and between most objects is a ridiculous distance regular people can't even begin to comprehend know what space is full of all the time though stars guess what we did not see in any the photos from the moon yep you guessed it stars there's a distinct lack of light sources from stars and pretty much all the photos from the trip it's a little eerie that the vast expanses of space are completely black and empty there's no atmosphere to cloud stars so theoretically it should be very easy to spot the bright lights from other stars but the pictures remain vacant it is theorized the NASA left the stars out because it would be impossible to map them out accurately and keen observers would quickly be able to discern the authenticity well NASA claims this is due to low quality photos their defense lacks credibility is twinkle twinkle little star conspiracy don't ruin our childhood at NASA number 2 got you in my sights to assist the astronauts and taking photos there were crosshairs included to help them aim which were imprinted along with each of the photos interestingly enough some of the photos show the crosshairs being covered by objects as if they were edited in afterwards this phenomenon did not happen once but rather multiple times it seems like a terrible photoshop job mean it really does not make sense but it occurs in a photo of the American flag and one more time in a photo of the land rover number one DejaVu despite labeling two photos is being taken many miles apart two photos from the moon landing show the exact same background behind it their claim of distance is an outright lie or mistake that's up for you to decide though NASA scientists defend this attack by claiming that the small size of the moon makes distances appear much closer than on earth regardless of this the backgrounds are definitely exact replicas of each other why would they label these photos incorrectly and make it seem like they went farther than they actually did remember in transformers where they turned off the tapes and went to the Dark Side of the Moon if they did actually land there and this indeed wasn't fake maybe they really were hiding something you

 was arriving at Victoria Crater, on Sol 951, sol being the term for a Martian day. This by itself was a remarkable achievement
 considering Opportunity was only designed to last 90 sols. During those 951 sols it had already achieved
 so much. By examining many different rocks in various
 locations along its journey, it was providing a host of data to determine if there used
 to be a water ocean on Mars in the past. During this journey, it had become stuck in
 sand dunes on numerous occasions, but each time it persevered and freed itself. Some of its parts had begun to malfunction,
 but engineers had been able to implement workarounds which meant Opportunity had been
 able to go on unhindered. It had also survived dust storms that lasted
 for days on end, but thankfully it was always able to charge its batteries up again afterwards. So, what was so interesting about Victoria
 crater? Was it able to provide any valuable information
 about Mars that Opportunity hadn’t picked up anywhere else? I’m Alex McColgan and you’re watching
 Astrum, and together we will go through everything Opportunity did and discovered around the
 Victoria crater. Victoria was always going to be an important
 landmark for Opportunity to reach, although few thought Opportunity would last the 7 km
 journey from its initial landing site. At this point, Opportunity had lasted more
 than 10 times longer than its original designed lifespan. Victoria is the biggest crater Opportunity
 had visited yet, being 730 meters wide. It was also the deepest, meaning ancient bedrock
 outcrops along the walls of the crater were exposed to the surface. Exposed bedrock contains the clues to Mars’
 past that Opportunity was looking for. Also, as you can see, Victoria made for an
 impressive sight, especially in contrast to this otherwise flat plain that Opportunity
 had landed in. In preparation for this new exploration site,
 mission controllers uploaded new software to the rover, which would enable it to decide
 whether to send back an image, or to extend its arm in preparation to sample an interesting
 rock outcrop, and even improved the intelligence of the rover to detect obstacles it should
 avoid, and to make its own path around them. These features save a lot of time for mission
 controllers, who would have had to have gone through hundreds of images and wait through
 painful latency delay for commands to be sent to the rover. At its furthest point, the latency between
 Earth and Mars can be upwards of 40 minutes. This is one of the reasons why it took three
 years to only travel 7 kms up until this point. To test this new software update, mission
 controllers had Opportunity drive towards a patch of rubble, and settings were adjusted
 to make Opportunity think that this rubble was a no-go zone. In reality, the biggest of these rocks is
 only 10cm tall, meaning Opportunity could have easily driven over it, but they didn’t
 want to test the systems on something that could actually damage the rover if it went
 wrong, so they chose these rocks instead! As you can see, the rover adjusted its course
 around the dangerous area, and took this panorama so mission controllers could see how the rover
 responded to the new program. Opportunity began to circle to outskirts of
 the crater, imaging it as it went. It came across a few cliffs, or “Capes”
 along the way, imaging them with a very clever technique called a “super-resolution mosaic”. These images have a much higher resolution
 than the camera onboard Opportunity is capable of, and they way they did this is by taking
 lots of photos of the same thing, and then in post processing on Earth they combined
 the images to provide the resolution you see here. On a side note, this technique is used in
 many different fields, including microscopy and astronomy. Scientists say that the layers you see in
 the rocks found in all these cliff faces are due to a geological process called cross-bedding. They believe these layers are ancient sand
 dune deposits, which is why the lines are inclined upwards and not just horizontally. From these lines, they predict that this used
 to be a sand dune field not unlike the Sahara Desert on Earth. While this science data was very useful, mission
 controllers were primarily looking for a passage down to the crater floor, and they thought
 they found one by here at the ‘Valley Without Peril’. On closer examination though, it was decided
 that the slope was too steep. Opportunity investigated a couple of cliffs
 while it was there, and even came across another meteorite called Santa Caterina, before mission
 controllers decided to drive the whole way back to the original arrival point at the
 crater to try and get down by there. This site was chosen because the slope was
 within the safety limits of the rover, plus the ground was made of flat, exposed bedrock,
 which meant it wouldn’t have much wheel slippage. On the 28th June 2007, or 1,200 sols into
 the mission, Opportunity prepared itself for its descent. But just as it perched itself on the top of
 the slope, the biggest dust storm Opportunity had seen yet rolled in, decreasing the brightness
 of the Sun by 96%. That’s not quite as bad as it sounds, as
 the dust also scatters some of the sunlight towards the rover too, meaning it was generating
 roughly 128 watts on the darkest day compared to its usual 700 watts on a clear day. But this is bad news for a solar powered rover,
 that kind of power level isn’t enough to keep the rover going, in fact anything under
 150 watts means the batteries begin to run flat. So, operations were cut back substantially
 until the storm was over, and Opportunity was only commanded to communicate back to
 Earth once every 3 days. If the batteries did run flat, the components
 on board Opportunity could be damaged due to the intense cold on the planet during the
 night. Typically, the motors have heaters powered
 by the batteries during the night to keep the motors warm, if the batteries run flat,
 there would be nothing to stop there being extreme temperature differences between night
 and day, at the equator anywhere up to 20°c during the day and -75°c at its coldest at
 night, which would damage the sensitive components. The reason for this temperature variability
 is because although Mars does have an atmosphere, it is 100 times thinner than Earth’s meaning
 it is not anywhere near as good at retaining the heat it absorbs during the day. Going back to the batteries, if they reached
 a critical level, Opportunity was also designed to trip a low-power fault. This basically disconnects the rover’s batteries
 from all but the most essential systems of the rover, putting it to sleep as it tries
 to charge its batteries with whatever available sunlight there is. Every sol the rover would check the battery
 level to see if it could reconnect the other systems, and if so, it would then re-establish
 communications with Earth. This low-power mode could mean the rover stays
 asleep for only a few days, but also it could go on for weeks or even months. Chances are that at that point, even if it
 did switch back on, too many of its components would be broken and it wouldn’t be able
 to function anyway. Back to the dust storm at the start of July,
 2007, mission controllers initially thought it would only last a week, but by the 15th
 July the storm had reached its peak. These are true colours images showing a time
 lapse of the storm, and as you can see it does get very dark. Thankfully, the severity of the dust storm
 was not quite enough to trigger the low-power fault this time, although it did get worryingly
 close for a while. Eventually, by 21st August, or sol 1271, the
 storm had cleared enough so that Opportunity could start to move forward again. Sol 1291 saw Opportunity finally enter the
 inner slope of the crater, but like it did before with the previous crater, just after
 it entered, it backed out again to assess the amount of wheel slippage from the slope. As it happened, wheel slippage did exceed
 the mission controller’s threshold of 40%, so the rover stopped with two of its wheels
 still over the lip of the crater. After two days of decision making, mission
 controllers decided to press ahead regardless, and an extended exploration into the crater
 began. As Opportunity descended, it took some time
 to investigate any interesting looking parts of the exposed bedrock. It also took some images of the cliffs on
 either side of it. I think these images showcase just how steep
 the slope is that Opportunity is sitting on, roughly 20 degrees. Opportunity didn’t venture too far into
 the crater, as only sand dunes were found towards the base. It spent its time examining this light patch
 of bedrock, taking various pictures and using its rock abrasion tool to investigate the
 rock’s structure. It was determined from the data Opportunity
 collected that this area was likely not ever so hospitable to life, so mission controllers
 picked the next waypoint on their journey, Endeavour crater. If you thought Victoria was big, look at this
 mammoth. Endeavour was thought to contain some clays,
 meaning water was once there, so Opportunity started its journey out of Victoria. At this point, on sol 1502, Opportunity encountered
 another fault with its arm. No matter how much power they put into the
 joint, the arm wouldn’t move from its stowed position under the rover. Sol after sol passed, and the joint refused
 to move, until they determined the time of day the joint had the least electrical resistance,
 which was just at dawn before the heater for the motor switched off during the day. When that time came again, they put as much
 power as possible into the motor and… it worked. Not risking ever stowing it away again, engineers
 had to determine how to manoeuvre the rover safely without risking damage to the arm. Opportunity then began its 2-year trek towards
 the Endeavour crater. Which we will save for the next episode! Ever wondered about the process of getting
 to far away planets? When we think of spacecraft hurtling through
 space, we often imagine them with their thrusters always on full power. But as Brilliant's daily problems explain,
 this isn't the case. So how do spacecraft travel through space? The problems Brilliant present give you the
 context and framework that you need to tackle it, so that you learn the concepts by applying
 them. If you like the problem and want to learn

pounds on January 31st 1971 the crew of Apollo 14 would leave Earth on their mission for the moon the man who began our first decade of manned spaceflight would command the mission that would close that decade Alan Shepard within Stuart Roosa would orbit the moon alone while Shepard and Edgar Mitchell explored its surface their destination a rugged area of lunar Highlands called prom morale Apollo 13 aborted as it neared the moon had been unable to land at this site now we were trying again but why for morale what happened to the moon during its first billion years a period of raised on earth how did the US and moon different overall composition by visiting from our oh we hope to sample a very bedrock of the moon material very different from that so far collected material perhaps dating back to the beginning of the solar system how can you think of the soil being 4.5 billion years old when igneous rocks which presumably underlying are only 3.5 or 3.7 billion years old this side suppose will be dramatically refuted or confirmed at the Apollo 14 mission when they actually visit from on most of the activity is associated with one place on the moon and we have tentatively located that place in or near the crater through morrow everything went smoothly during Earth orbit and for the burn that sent Apollo 14 toward the moon then Stuart Musa Lubitz man module Kittyhawk to adopting with the lunar module Antares still attached to the third stage of the booster twice they tried three times as the astronauts waited an identical docking probe was brought in to Mission Control this probe on the command module fits into a funnel-like device on the lunar module called a drogue tiny catches on the probes point engaged the drogue it was these capture latches that were not holding in space the astronauts tried a fourth time and a food in space on earth they searched for solution then on the sixth try as they coasted to the moon the crew brought the probe inside the spacecraft for examination on earth the probe was tempted and retested but we had to be sure that the probe would work for the most critical docking as Shepard initial return from the lunar surface on February 4th Apollo 14 went into orbit around the moon as Apollo 14 was on its first orbit the third stage of the Boosters smashed into the moon at its planned target form its impact picked up by the seismometer left by Apollo 12 the structure of the moon's interior is one of the major mysteries of lunar science now another piece was added that could help solve the puzzle later that day Shepard and Mitchell climbed into the lunar module Antares and undocked prior to descent but as they checked out the lunar module a problem appeared an erroneous abort was being signaled on board Antares and in Mission Control should this occur during the landing burn Antares would abort automatically and the landing would be off the Mission Control team had to hours the time of one lunar orbit to find a solution flight controller dick Thorson diagnosed the trouble as a loose particle in the abort button the burden then came to rest on the shoulders of computer programmer Donald Isles working against time at MIT in Cambridge Massachusetts he reprogrammed the lunar module computer to ignore the false signal this new program was then checked out in a simulator at Cape Kennedy as Antares came into contact with earth again the instructions were sent up to the crew less than 10 miles above the lunar surface Shepard and Mitchell swept across the landing site then another problem the landing radar

out from the G for 60 miles in the lunar crust all in all the from ro materials should contain a great deal of new information about the early history of the Moon and thus help us to better understand the formation of our ns five and a half hours later Shepard left the lunar module to begin the first of two explorations ladder Roger ten years later 114 hours 22 minutes after leaving Earth Alan Shepard stepped onto the moon that looks like you're about on the bottom step and on the surface four minutes later he was joined by Ed Mitchell following the tradition of two previous missions Shepherd and Nixle planted the flag in the lunar soil the next job was to load the met a rich starlight wagon the astronauts were used to transport their tools of exploration and collected samples one of the big factors in lunar exploration is mobility in Apollo 14 we had be met which let us move further afield in the previous two missions in future missions we'll use the lunar rover a sort of moon going dune buggy this mobility will mean less time spending getting from here to there and more time collecting scientific data Shepard pulled the map while Mitchell carried the bar bell shaped package containing an automatic scientific station they would assemble a station designed to continue broadcasting data to earth for a year after men departed ROM ro finding a suitable site to place the scientific instruments was the next order of business Shepard and Mitchell now began setting up the automated scientific laboratory a small nuclear generator to power the array the Central Station to transmit data to earth a seismometer to detect and measure activity on and within the moon a series of three experiments to measure charged particles near the lunar surface an independent experiment to reflect laser beams from Earth enabling extremely precise measurements of such things as earth to moon distance the wobble of the Earth's axis continental drift and shifts of the Earth's crust and a mortar to be fired by a signal from Earth sometime within the next year the impact of its charges would be picked up by Apollo 14 seismometer as a final exercise which will use the thumper a device to explode a series of controlled shotgun light charges the vibrations from these definitions were picked up by a series of instruments he had previously deployed with the instrument setup and operating they headed back toward Antares pausing on the way to collect samples they loaded their 44 pounds of lunar material aboard the lunar module and after four hours and 50 minutes on the surface climbed back into Antares as Shepard and Mitchell rested Stuart Roosa continued his work from lunar orbit his photographs would have meaning not only to the scientific community but would have direct bearing on the planning for coming missions 12 hours 40 minutes later Shepard and Mitchell began their second exploration period after loading the lunar rickshaw Mitchell began the journey to cone crater Shepard adjusted the television camera then hurried to join his partner point a the first stop on a trip to foam here they would collect and document samples measure the local magnetic field and take core tube samples from beneath the surface lake the quality of the scientific description by the astronauts could be termed by earth-based scientists only as excellent but now Shepard and Mitchell pushed on after a brief stop at a second survey site they began their assault on cone crater a climb not only toward the summit of a lunar mountain but back some time a large crater acts in many respects like a drill throwing out material from deep beneath the surface this material should be very different from any we've collected before perhaps dating back to the origins of the moon and even the solar system traitor take a break get the rap secret find out exactly where we are the match they was using had been made from photography from lunar orbit the how much craters ridges and boulders now they were working against son against the oxygen and water left in their backpacks against the aliens rain Tompa ribs thinking it's the rim of the crater and there's another Ridge standing in a boulder field surrounded by rocks 10 to 12 feet long the astronauts made their most difficult decision with the concurrence of Mission Control they stopped their climb less than 150 feet from the ends to begin the more important job of collecting samples the crew had no way of realizing they were so close it was a week after the mission before we determine this by photographic analysis while they could overcome the terrain they could not beat the steady drain of oxygen from their backpacks in the terms of scientific meaning the decision not to go on to the rim meant little in human terms a great disappointment the White Rock is of different composition for the Apollo 11 12 rocks in fact the chemistry of all the rocks that are being looked at so far is different to those rocks potassium and uranium are 10 times higher which to the sort of values we might expect that the Burma rocks represent ancient lunar crust which of course is what we're all hoping again it was time times our head back to the lunar module after a quick side trip to check on the science station they loaded the lunar module with samples and data and stepped off the lunar surface the second expedition had lasted four hours and 35 minutes a total exploration of a record nine and one-half hours thirty three and a half hours after they landed Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell lifted off in the silent vacuum of the moon rich over baby you're looking good from down here one minute half an hour later Stuart Roosa watched their progress from closing it a little more for the pictures of the service module would you believe that 350,000 families who profitting it's 70 feet watching him go around he looks very clean the inspection complete Antares and Kitty Hawk moved together breathe they transferred the gear from Antares to Kitty Hawk buttoned up the tunnel then jettison the lunar module it would crash into the moon at a predetermined spot its impact picked up by their seismometer and the seismometer left by Apollo 12 over a year earlier a hundred and forty nine hours after they left Earth they perform the burn that broke them out of lunar orbit during the coast to earth there would be time to catch up on sleep relax and do all the little things left undone and there was one more item a series of scientific demonstrations in zero gravity demonstrations impossible to reproduce on earth these trials looked at basic physical properties of matter in zero-gravity studies that could lead eventually to new materials manufactured in space for use on earth on February 9 1971 nine days after they left Earth the crew of Apollo 14 hit the atmosphere of their planet at a speed of over 24,000 miles per hour they hurtled toward Earth a meteor heading home on board 95 pounds of the moon extremely important as relates to the question of are we while we're pulling around Fallone it's really that the the imprint of history of solar system history on the earth moon system descended on the moon for the first 15 years what do we hope to gain is we've got a window right now between equal zero the beginning of the solar system and when the earth so totally messed up itself that we can't look at it anymore we'd like to look in there and that windows on the move Apollo 14 has already had a very big stand of impact and we still have three missions left they'll be heading into even more rugged and more interesting areas of the moon beginning with Apollo 15 the lunar rover will let us rains further afield and collect more and more varied sign of examples and information the study of the moon and how Princeton's elements and minerals are distributed in its crust will enable us to learn more about the process of crest formation on earth leading to a better understanding of the way that certain elements concentrate in the crust will we have had enough missions to the moon by the end of the Apollo program probably not you can never have enough knowledge but at least it's an action beginning"

Most fish die the same way — slow suffocation in the open air. It’s easy for fishers, but it causes fish tons of stress, and floods their bodies with chemicals like cortisol, adrenaline, and lactic acid. Those chemicals make the fish taste bad, smell “fishy,” and rot quickly. 

But there's a better way: a four-step Japanese method called ikejime. It involves sharp knives. And a brain spike. 

We adapted this video from Vox’s Future Perfect podcast, which goes much more in depth on ikejime: https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/14/18091698/future-perfect-podcast-killing-fish-ikejime-animal-welfare

 to bleed out. I know, it looks gruesome, but trust me, it’s
 better than the alternative for the fish, and for you. Most fish are killed the same way: Scooped
 out of the water, thrown in a bucket of ice, and left to suffocate to death. Their brains are really different from ours
 — which makes it hard to figure out if and how they feel pain. Studies are conclusive on one thing, though:
 fish do feel stress — and try to fight or flee stressful situations. It can take anywhere from five minutes to
 a few hours of struggling in the open air before a fish finally dies. And while they’re trying to escape, their
 bloodstreams fill with stress hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline. Plus, all that movement causes lactic acid
 to flood their muscles — the same chemical humans produce when we exercise. When a fish is struggling to death it's actually
 exercising when it's suffocating. This is Andrew Tsui, an attorney and former
 commercial fisherman whose real passion is teaching people how to properly kill fish. That lactic acid buildup in the muscle tissue
 actually has real consequences for it at a cellular level. These chemicals speed up the breakdown of
 muscle and fat, which causes the fish to lose its inherent rich flavor and adopt a bitter,
 mushy taste. They make fish rot quickly,
 And develop that unpleasant ‘fishy’ smell. Since most fish are killed this way, it’s
 probably all you’ve ever tasted. But there’s a better way. Ike jime is a traditional Japanese method
 for killing fish. It’s a four-step process, and according
 to Andrew, it basically translates to “brain spike."" He’ll show you why with this live Maryland
 striped bass from the Chesapeake Bay: So the first step is to actually make sure
 that this fish doesn't experience any stress. We're gonna kill this fish by placing a spike
 into its brain. You know that you've actually hit its brain
 when that fish seizes like this. Its dorsal and the rest of its fins flare
 and its mouth will flare. Once it’s spiked the fish is brain dead,
 meaning it can’t experience any more stress — but it’s heart is still beating from
 cellular energy reserves. Because its heart is still bleeding we're
 gonna use the residual blood pressure to, to pump out and bleed the fish This is also known as exsanguination. So the process of exsanguinating a fish is
 three cuts. The first cut is at the gill arches on both
 sides. And then the third cut is at the artery in
 the tail. Removing the blood means the fish rots slower. At this point, even though the fish is braindead,
 the nervous system can still cause involuntary muscle movement — which adds to that unsavory
 lactic acid buildup. The next step shuts that down. One of the more gruesome parts of ike jime
 is the spinal cord destruction and the necessity of it sort of varies by species. But essentially what the objective is, is
 to cease any further signaling between the central nervous system and the muscle tissue. And that takes place in the spinal cord. One of the ways that that is achievable is
 by sending a metal pith. Through the spinal cord of the fish. Last but not least, the fish goes into a bath
 of ice water. We use a one to one ice to water ratio to
 create a slurry and then submerge the fish fully and in the slurry. In there, the muscles cool down and the fish
 finishes bleeding out. When you take a look inside a fish, you can
 really see the difference using ike jime makes. Both of these fish were caught earlier this
 day. One was killed using the standard method — suffocation
 — and one was killed using the ike jime method. When Andrew opened them up, they looked relatively
 the same — but you can see that the suffocated one is filled with a lot of blood, the stuff
 that causes quick decomposition. We did a taste test, and... They honestly taste pretty similar. It tastes fresh. There's not like an overwhelming flavor to
 it. It’s a few days later when things start
 to change: FDA guidelines recommend cooking and eating
 refrigerated fish within two days, but since ike jime slows rotting immensely,
 the fish is good for much longer, which means its able to develop more complex flavors,
 similar to the way red meat tastes better when it’s aged. This fish was purchased whole from the grocery
 store, killed using the standard suffocation method. It’s a couple of days old. And this one was killed using the ike jime
 method — it’s been sitting in the fridge at 33 degrees for two whole weeks. When we opened both of them up, the suffocated
 one had a distinct fishy aroma. Wow, yeah, I can really smell it now. It smells so metally, and gross. Oh my god! Its insides had blood running through them,
 and were starting to break apart, providing more space for bacteria to grow. The aged ike jime fish, on the other hand,
 had barely any scent. It tasted different too:
 This is the one I'm nervous about. This is the one from the store that's a couple
 days old. Oh my God. It's not great. I'll be honest with you. It's a little sour. OK so this is supposed to be the primo fish. The one that was has been aging for two weeks
 after being killed with the ike jime method. You can tell underneath it there's just like
 this hint of complexity And once we added a bit of salt to bring that
 flavor out: Oh my God, that is so good. I don't even know what it tastes like, but
 it's delicious. So it tastes so much better and lasts much
 longer, why aren’t fish killed using the ike jime method? The answer is simple: Cost. It’s almost impossible to scale ike jime
 on commercial ship decks and fish farms, Where it’s just cheaper and easier to default
 to asphyxiation. For now, there is one particular market for
 fish killed using the ike jime method: high-end restaurants, especially ones serving sushi. Like La Marine in France,
 Or Providence in LA. These restaurants pay a lot of money for ike jime fish from Japan, its primary exporter. But elsewhere in the world, fishers are sitting
 on an untapped market. If they used the ike jime method, they could
 sell their fish for a lot more money. Anyone if given the opportunity to look at
 two filets side by side or two fish side by side will immediately immediately notice these
 distinctions suddenly, it's just that that opportunity doesn't really come around very
 often. I like to to think that Ike Jime is actually
 about intellectual integrity. So the integrity of the fish, the integrity
 of sort of what we're really doing here, which is ultimately creating something to eat. Making a smarter choice in the food system can help us feel good about our decisions. And making the smarter choice for mobile can, too. Ting is a cellular service provider that only charges you for the data you actually use, not a flat monthly bill. These days most people are using Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and iMessage to send the majority of their texts. And yet still pay for expensive unlimited talk and text packages. On top of that, if you're the type of person who's almost connected to WiFi, which doesn't count toward data usage, Ting can give you serious savings. Like your phone bill could be as low as $23 a month serious. And if you use less data, you pay less. Ting offers nation-wide LTD coverage across two major networks. So the phone you already own probably already works with Ting. All you need is a SIM card. Make the smarter choice for mobile and get $25 off your monthly bill at vox.ting.com.

moonlanding,Space is a hostile environment for human beings. No part of it will permit you to survive longer than a minute. But what's the fastest way to die in space?,What's The Fastest Way To Die In Space? Space Has So Many Ways to Kill You,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQZYW2oBYr8,0,32258,447,12,85,EQZYW2oBYr8,"Just in case you were planning to jump out
 into the vacuum of space without a spacesuit, I urge you to reconsider. There's nothing but painful suffocation and
 death. Do not do it. You probably wouldn't be here if you weren't
 wondering, just how lethal is space? What are all the ways space is trying to kill
 you? Space has a swiss army knife of methods to
 do you in. You won't be surprised to learn that classic
 sci-fi usually had it wrong. If you jumped out into the cold deep void
 without a protective suit, you wouldn't pop like a giant pressurized juicy meat pimple. Your blood doesn't boil, and you don't flash
 freeze. The good news is even though there is a pressure
 difference, human skin is strong enough to keep your body together. The bad news is you just plain old asphyxiate,
 almost instantaneously. The human body has about 15 seconds of usable
 oxygen in the blood. Once you run through that oxygen, you'll take
 a quick space nap and then die a few minutes later. On Earth, you can hold your breath for a few
 minutes but this gets much harder in space, as the low pressure forces the air out of
 your lungs. In fact, it would probably be wise to breathe
 every last bit of air out before you stepped out, since it's coming out violently, one
 way or another. Here's the amazing thing. If you jumped out into space and could get
 back into a pressurized environment within a minute or so, you probably wouldn't suffer
 any permanent damage, aside from a little bruising, some hypothermia and a really nasty
 sunburn. Stay out for any longer, though, and the damage
 will get worse. Beyond a few minutes and you'll be done. Which is just fine, as you weren't planning
 on going out into space without a spacesuit anyway. Unfortunately, even tucked safely in your
 spacecraft, there are tremendous risks to being away from the comfort of Earth. You've got to be worried about radiation. Once a spacecraft leaves the protection of
 the Earth's magnetic field, it's exposed to the high levels constantly streaming through
 space. A trip from Earth to Mars and back again might
 increase your overall risk developing a fatal cancer by about 5%, and that's a risk most
 astronauts are willing to take. But there are solar storms blasting out from
 the Sun that could deliver a lethal dose of radiation in just a few hours. Astronauts would need a safe, radiation-shielded
 location during these solar storms or they'd expire from acute radiation poisoning. There are many, many other risks from traveling
 in space. Fire is one of the worst, failure of your
 oxygen system, access to clean water and food become an obvious problem. Even things we usually don't think about,
 like mold building up in the damp environment of a spaceship becomes a problem. Survive all these immediate hazards, just
 like here on Earth, the long term hazards will get you. We have no idea if it's even possible for
 the human body to exist in microgravity for longer than a few years. Your bones dissolve, your muscles waste away,
 and there might be other consequences. So far, nobody is willing to run the experiment
 long enough to find out. And finally, the fastest way space can kill
 you is likely impact with debris. Even though space is mostly empty, there's
 all kinds of material whizzing around. Every spacecraft is pockmarked with micrometeorite
 impacts. There are holes punched through the International
 Space Station's solar panels. These tiny pieces of rock can be traveling
 at 10 kilometers per second when they impact the spacecraft. Spacecraft have layers of protection to absorb
 smaller particles, but there's no way to prevent larger objects from causing catastrophic damage If those layers weren't there you'd be a short
 hop skip and a jump from becoming a heavily perforated spongebob spacepants. The solution? You just have to hope they never hit. There certainly a many ways to quickly die
 in space, but what's really amazing to me is how we can actually overcome many of these
 risks, certainly long enough to reach other worlds in the Solar System. Traveling in space is dangerous and difficult,
 but the exciting thing is it's still possible. And one day, we'll do it. So, even knowing the risks, would you travel
 in space? (To replace our current trailer) Thanks for watching! Never miss an episode by clicking subscribe

California here for about three days if anybody see me walking around I have to explain have the same suit on for three days because I like this suit I bought it from the catalog and I enjoy it gives you those guys modeling clothes and catalog never see those guys doing the same thing in a suit every time I put on the suit I gotta go like this I'll just outside stand in the front going anybody ever see those guys that model their underwear in these books and they smile while they're doing this stand out they're going did you notice these guys never have no bulge you'd ever check that out and that standing man in front of millions of people smiling first of all if they have no balls I would not be modeling to under it's second of all I damn sure wouldn't be smiling I might be modeling like this you know Johnny said some about buckwheat low earlier was talking about buckwheat and I did buckwheat on my show right and the name buckwheat I started thinking right I'm from a predominantly black family and I have yet to run into a relative named buck we'd had a cookout you can't just walk off the streets we walk up some I see how you know I my name is Tom what's yours my name buck remain nice to meet you yeah buck wheat that's my name I'm serious but I got the last name buckwheat that's it I'm serious no believe me and they're right Steinman it is my brother stymie

moonlanding,Former Secret Service officer reveals on 'Hannity' that the presidential candidate is an angry person who habitually lies,Author says Hillary Clinton is 'two different people',https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdQVfEKjUEI,1,538894,7126,264,1468,PdQVfEKjUEI,welcome back to Hannity as we continue now with former Secret Service Officer Gary Byrne is an explosive new book crisis of character you didn't finish the story about the vase because that morning he came down after that vase was broken and he had a black eye that like a big black eye sure sure so after the the incident when he came the next time I saw him in the Oval Office he had a mark under his eye he could see they were trying to hide it with makeup and when I won't work obviously not ya know I'll know had I walked into the secretary's office and I I said the what happened to the president has got a mark under his eye and his assistant Nancy Ehrenreich said oh that's uh he's allergic to coffee and I said under one eye I don't understand that yeah that doesn't make sense right but there was really a crisis the Secret Service had to decide whether or not his own wife was a physical threat to the president right I think the issue was that it was a concern we I meant I've discussed it with other officers at the time and agents what do you do about a domestic dispute what if what if the parent what was the answer each situation is different you know you have to protect the president to protect a and you have to protect the the first lady but you know if he gets caught with some woman and she goes ballistic then what happens to you would the door you're like the doorkeeper pretty much you were the guy in front of oval office door if somebody got in to see the president they had to go through you pretty much okay me or the other there were six officers how often would you know that that person was there for another reason to be with the president in a romantic way so the way it worked would be like if I came up and relieved somebody on post the officer that I'm relieving is gonna say hey you know he's in there with Lewinsky or whoever and you know they haven't been in there a while just a heads-up so it wasn't like we were cops it's gossip and you have to pass this stuff on I don't want to blindside your coworker so you always pass this information on and and we were concerned I mean what if she did catch the president in a compromising situation but you had a plan for that you if wherever Hillary was you guys were communicating if she was headed down and then you'd have to go warn him well I never actually warned them but yes that was the plan like yeah that was a plan you have a plan in place basically yes I mean that's all right let me play I pointed out on this program and on my radio program that she's often angry yeah somebody you're describing with a volcanic temper yes let's play some Hillary and I also think we'd be a lot better off if we actually talked to each other instead of yelling at each other I think it's time we treated everybody in this country with respect with kindness with love I know we can create more good-paying jobs and raise incomes for hardworking Americans again I know that we can finish the job of universal health care coverage I know we can combat climate change and be the clean energy superpower of the 21st century I know we can make college affordable and get student debt off the backs of young people she does seem angry a lot right and you're saying behind closed doors when nobody's looking she's that angry person always portal mostly or distant cold what I've been looking at there Sean doesn't concern me too much that's her being a politician the kind of anger I'm talking about is where she just almost can't even complete a sentence she starts yelling and screaming and cussing you know I talked in the book house by the way this treating people in their tradition sure all the time you yes the uniformed Division Officers agents so this is like a describing of you're describing a phony fake fraudulent human being absolutely all right let me give you an example this is Hillary you know saying she remembers landing under sniper fire when she went to Bosnia this is what she said I remember landing under sniper fire there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicles to get to our base great image-making but here's the problem we I have the real video and this is it this is Hillary arriving not under sniper fire but she walks up to a group of young girls who give her flowers and give her gifts that's not exactly sniper fire so is that the person you're trying to warn America about yes explain she in other words she's she sits with an interview with Bill you think they're the happiest couple together light goes off she hates him right I don't know if she hates him or not but but I will tell you that the example you just showed there is the perfect example of anybody that worked around them in the Secret Service when they saw that they knew fled they start laughing their faces off because they knew that was a flat-out lie now I wasn't on that mission but I talked to the guys at work and the only thing that the military had them do is sit on their flak Vestas they were getting close to the ground which is standard procedure and those but when when she made the claim that they were under sniper fire I knew it was a lie I want to go back to where we started you feel compelled to do this I do you never signed a non-disclosure you have the right to some people wish he didn't do it because the position you're in now guys do have to sign non-disclosure hey Janine I believe 2004 okay what is it the final question what do you want people to know what you saw in their years as president well first thing I'd like to know is I'm not comfortable about talking about this but I've I feel so strongly that people need to know the real Hillary Clinton and and how dangerous she is in her behavior she is not a leader she is not a least it doesn't have the temperament I have the temperament she didn't have the temperament to to handle the social office in when she was first lady she does not have the temperature he's dishonest she's dishonest she bitch'll eli's anybody that you know can separate themselves from their politics and and and review her behavior over the last you're gonna be to you this being political absolutely I'm sure I will be I have been already and it was no answer it's not it's got nothing to do with politics it's a real country it is love of country and I hope some day that it does make a difference I mean if mrs. Clinton ends up being the president United States then then she's our president and she's the commander in chief and it is what it is but if she did become the president without me speaking the truth I'm not sure I could I could deal with that people need to know this is serious and and her behavior is appalling is she's two different people all right Gary Bern thank you for being with us appreciate you talk you so much thanks for telling your story

how strange thank you very much today the Surgeon General announ introduced the first safe Santa but we wonder who half of that works here he has a Velcro lap so your kid can't fall off and hurt himself you didn't tell me uh you're from Massachusetts yes you're from or Oregon and I'm from Nebraska and we're now living in California is Christmas a little bit different alcohol it's we're get-- used to it temperatures the other day were 84 um in Malibu it's really weird now when I was back in Nebraska you know Santa would come slide down the chimney put an orange in your stocking out in Malibu Santa jumps through a solar panel and leaves a Kiwi in your Reeboks they had sadly they had to cancel the nativity scene in Malibu's a town square there was a real estate boom last week and the manger went condo ha would that laugh come from one of them Oh from the staff and sit and this morning I really got in the Christmas spirit I saw a small group of Malibu children faxing sanded their Christmas lists from from their car phones for the facility I'm trying to get into it out here but it did stop in Beverly Hills this time of year they want to do something for the less fortunate so they have the they're collecting now for the foie gras drive for the neediest cases and though they go around in Beverly Hills so you live in Beverly Hills we're close to Beverly Hills they go around this time of year and give away coupons for tuxedo rentals to the neediest people is there is there a revolver in the house well I'm gonna keep plunging ahead cuz I I know you're gonna get in the Christmas spirit um I read today that George Bush is sending out 90,000 Christmas cards this year now the big question is will Dan Quayle finish licking those envelopes in time ah thank you for your support speaking of George Bush the White House is gonna have a new dog what's the president's dog's name no rectum no I know what I'm up against we got a crew audience no it was right look they used to have lucky yeah Reagan his hair gray I'm dying the guy in the audience is scoring big no record lucky they sent him on to the ranch in Santa Barbara and then they got Rex they're gonna have a new the dog is called Millie Millie yeah now you didn't know about Mellie because he was kept out of the spotlight during the campaign because Bush was fighting that wimp image so they didn't want him to have a dog named Millie he was replaced temporarily by a pit bull named butch it's all right uh Millie he's Millie's official duties will be the same as a Reagan's dog and that's to pull the president away from Sam Donaldson's questions you know I want you saw the televised address of a Yasser Arafat address the special session of the United Nations in Geneva there was one small embarrassment I don't know if you're aware of this but apparently the airline's lost his luggage on the way over and he addressed the General Assembly wearing a monogrammed towel on his head from the Geneva Hilton didn't Regan make his farewell address to some federal employees four day before yesterday what he has not said goodbye to me yet he said to say goodbye to you sir well I'm gonna say goodbye to you there's a cruel crowd here tonight anyway he's talking about the Iron Triangle oh you hear that he was talking about the deficit and the president says the deficit wasn't his fault a beeper went off in the audience see if you can call my writers on that damn thing I'm no good you know you're not doing well when a guy calls for the paramedics during the mom anybody remember what I was talking about that the president it's taking no responsibility for the deficit he said it wasn't his fault he came up with he think the Iron Triangle which was the news media members of Congress and the special interest groups iron triangles kind of a catchy phrase it'll probably be remembered by historians a lot longer those who think a thousand points of light but a lot of presidents I'm rushing along here we have a busy show and I shouldn't be doing this much actually um outgoing presidents for example like to uh like to want us other things if you remember a person I smile remember aunty was present you knighted States he was born Elvis cool was quite a while ago but was it was in all the papers you must read about eisenhower warned us of the what the hell are they that's right the military industrial complex and Reagan war two Saban see Iron Triangle and Jerry Ford warned us about the third step going up here Force One play poker hey why don't I give up because I am show business folks that's right um ring Regan actually blamed the deficit on what he calls the Iron Triangle now if I was gonna pick a geometric figure to blame the deficit wouldn't the Pentagon be better than a triangle okay uh-huh that's that's about it for me you got"
moonlanding,"In honor of Claire Foy’s first appearance on the show, Ellen found it fitting to scare “The Crown” star with an unexpected visit from the “Queen.” The actress also divulged that she knew her Best Supporting Actress opponent Regina King was going to win the Golden Globe.

 is completely different. And you disappear
 into different roles. And I'm just a huge fan. Thank you. You're really kind. So you were at the Golden
 Globes the other night. You were nominated
 for First Man. I was. And did you have fun? I loved it. Yes? It was the first time I've
 been where I'm not working. So I could go and not have
 to worry about getting on an 11 hour flight home. And I didn't have to worry
 about how much I drank. And it was just amazing. It just felt really fun and
 a really good experience. Oh, good. So you were nominated. You did not win. I didn't. But now when you think
 about, just to remind you-- When you think about
 like going in that night, there's always a chance
 that someone's going to win. You might not. But you have a
 speech ready maybe. Did you have a speech? Well, this time I
 did say to myself, I won an Emmy in September. Right. And I hadn't even considered
 that I was going to-- it didn't even enter my mind
 that I was going to win. And I deeply regret that,
 because I was very surprised and said nothing of
 any importance at all, and just shook a lot,
 and was terrified. This time I made sure I ran
 through names in my head. But I knew Regina
 King was going to win. She's amazing. Really? Oh, yeah. Yeah. So you already
 kind of had a face ready for if you lose, what that
 face is, that kind of I'm happy that I didn't win, that
 face that people do. I'm sort of always happy
 that other people win. I mean, if they just went,
 and you were all terrible, so no one's won. Right. Wow. Then I'd be like, oh,
 that's really bad. That'd be a shock. But if anybody wins that,
 it's good, isn't it? Yeah. Winning's good for anyone. Because there's a
 face that you see. It looks like you're very-- My sister looks more. That's my sister. She's like, wrong decision. That's what she's saying. Yeah. I look sort of intrigued? Yes. You do. You look intrigued. No. That's probably caught in the
 middle of just about to smile, or something like that. Right? Trying to get something
 out of my teeth. Yes. Right. So The Crown was completely
 different than this character, than The Girl in the Spider Web. That was really
 completely different. But when you did
 The Crown, did you know it was going
 to be two seasons? Yeah. That was sort of
 the draw really. It was. Especially for me and Matt. Because Matt had
 done Doctor Who. And I'd been on quite a few
 TV shows and things like that. And I think the idea of
 seven years is something. I'm a bit of a commitment phobe. So that sort of makes
 me a bit scared. So the idea of just
 doing two seasons of this incredible thing
 was like brilliant. Yeah. It's going to continue on. Someone's going to play
 the queen as she ages. But I think everybody was like,
 oh my god, Claire's not coming. Cause you're so good in that. I mean, you're so-- Portia and I just walk around
 the house going, n'yes. Because you do that every time. We say, n'yes. So The Girl in the Spider
 Web, that was amazing. So you play the queen, and
 then you play this character. Look at that undercut. Look at that undercut. I loved it. And the bowl cut as well. That's the only thing. I was like, how did that
 hair look good all the time. No matter what you went through. There's an explosion,
 and everything, and your hair is
 perfect the whole time. Yeah. In everyday life, not so great. Really? Yeah. I wore a lot of hats. But it looked good. So now, and you're
 not on a motorcycle. But it looks like you're on one. Was that you on a motorcycle? I was on a motorcycle on
 the back of a fast moving car, which is the best
 way to be on a motorcycle if you ask me, because
 its no responsibility. Right. And you were tilting and
 stuff like you were on. Yeah. wow that seems like
 that would be fun. Because it was pretend then. It's much better than
 doing it in real life. Because I was going to
 ask you if you're not scared of anything, because
 to be on a motorcycle seems dangerous. And you seem like
 you're fearless. There was quite a lot of
 fire and stuff in that film. There was quite a lot of
 things that other people are in control of. Whenever anyone
 else is in control, like people flying
 planes, I always want to be involved in some way. But what are you
 mainly scared of? Anything bad happening
 to my daughter. I now just project anything
 that might go wrong on to her. Well, being a parent, yeah. That would be. And that's it? That's the only thing you're-- Ah! I have literally just
 had a heart attack. Who was that person? I'm not sure. Honestly, my heart is pounding. I'm so sorry. Do you do that to people
 a lot on this show? Uh-huh. Yeah. Not everyone. A lot of people really get
 their feelings hurt if I don't. So you should feel honored. Whoa. Yeah. He really meant that, I felt.
 Like he was quite aggressive. I don't know how he was dressed. Let's take a look. We'll see it again. Oh no. And that's it? That's the only thing
 you're afraid of? Ah! He was dressed as the queen. Oh, my god. It's a good sign that
 I didn't try and run for the exit or anything. I just sat there and went,
 this is going to end soon. Well, and that's how you react. Now you know. See. Oh, my god. OK. All right. We'll have to take a break now. Yes, please."
moonlanding,"The Von Braun rotating space station will be the first commercial space construction project in history. It will be serviced by the SpaceX Starship and be designed to accommodate national space agency laboratories, billionaires who want to own property in space, and space tourists.
Please visit our website at www.gatewayspaceport.com/membership",SpaceX Starship and The Von Braun Rotating Space Station,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTNP01Sg-Ss,0,791570,12362,1421,3085,vTNP01Sg-Ss,"the Gateway foundation was formed to build the first spaceport in order to do that we must first build a few smaller structures first one of the most important is a von Braun rotating space station this will likely be the first commercial space construction project in history my name is John bling co and I'm president of the Gateway foundation in a station design that is not a corporate rotation is almost a waste of time for short periods of time but zero-g platform can make sense but if you have workers there for more than two or three months then forget it why you'll understand after I read to you a first-hand account by astronaut scott kelly after we returned for 340 days at the International Space Station every part of my body hurts all of my joints and all my muscles are protesting the crushing pressure of gravity I'm also nauseate 'add although I haven't thrown up a crack of light wakes me is it morning no it's just amiko coming to bed I've only slept a couple of hours but I feel delirious it's a struggle to come to consciousness enough to even move to tell her how awful I feel I'm seriously nauseated now feverish my pain has gotten worse this isn't how I felt after my last mission this is much much worse I struggled to get up find the edge of the bed feet down sit up stand up at every stage I feel like I'm fighting through quick sound when I'm finally vertical the pain in my legs is awful and on top of that pain I feel a sensation that's even more alarming it feels as though all the blood of my body is rushing to my legs like the sensation of blood rush into your head when you do a handstand but in Reverse I can feel the tissue in my leg swelling I shuffle my way to the bathroom I make it to the bathroom flip on the light look down at my legs they are swollen and alien stumps not legs at all I say amiko come look at this she kneels down and squeezes one ankle it squishes like a water balloon she looks up on me with worried eyes I can't even feel your ankle bones she says my skin is burning too I tell her and Miko frantically examines me I have a strange rash all over my back the backs of my legs the back of my head and neck everywhere I was in contact with the bed I wonder whether my friend Misha back in Moscow suffering from the same swollen legs and painful rashes I suspect so our space agencies won't be able to push out further into space to a destination like Mars until we can learn more about how to strengthen the weakest links in the chain that makes spaceflight possible the human body and mind this is a nightmare it sounds like a science fiction horror movie this is what 340 days in zero-g space did a Scott Kelly's body but was he okay after shorter trips to space here again in his own words on my previous flight to the space station a mission of 159 days I lost bone mass my muscles atrophied and my blood redistribute itself in my body which strained and shrank the walls of my heart more troubling I experienced problems with my vision as many other astronauts had people need gravity so that bodies won't fall apart but how much will lunar gravity be okay for a year but not for two years well Martian gravity worked for humans long term but not for large farm animals with two days a week at 30% G be enough for ISS crews to retain bone mass building the von braun's space station can help us unlock those secrets so let's have a look at the station Brown station will be a rotating Space Station designed to produce varying levels of artificial gravity by increasing or decrease in the rate of rotation the station will be designed from the start to accommodate both National Space Agency's conducting low gravity research and space tourists who want to experience life and a large Space Station with the comfort of low gravity and the feel of a nice hotel structure will consist of two concentric structural rings fixed together with a set of spokes supporting an outer habitation ring made up of large modules can have is an unpressurized ring structure with docking arms and stabilizers designed to capture and lock in place visiting spacecraft unload passengers and cargo at first there will be only one docking port but later we will add another so the two craft can be docked at the station at the same time all passenger and cargo access to the station will be through a set of pressurized access tubes connecting the docking hub to the outer ring truss the outer ring truss is a triangular unpressurized ring trust supported by network of spokes to the docking hub set inside this truss is an access tube that will allow people to move about the station freely below the outer ring trust are a series of large connected pressurized modules this is called the habitation ring our original design was very much like Wernher von Braun's rotating space station hence the name but we soon solved problems and had to change the design first where are the escape vehicles if you cannot evacuate the whole population during emergency then you have recreated the Titanic second if your modules here next to the elevator tube then everyone going to modules here and here must pass through yours coming and going every day so we created the access tube structure and designed big couplings to mount the escape vehicles on our original design had a square Oh Artie but dr. Thomas Locker changed the truss design from Square to try and get her to increase strength and reduce mass after that we decided to put the access tube inside it then we move the spokes when the center apex lawns run to the base launch rails this will allow the elevator tubes to rise up between the spokes at the juncture of each set of modules there will be a coupling that connects the modules together and connects the habitation ring to the outer ring access tube above it inside the outer ring truss set into the coupling floor will be an access door to the escape vehicles do you evacuate the facility should that need arise this matrix of pressurized tubes will consist of the docking hub access tubes the four elevator tubes and the access tube embedded in the outer ring trust above the ring of habitation modules the Gateway foundations construction arm orbital assembly will design and build a frame this will consist of the docking hub the spokes and the outer ring truss orbital assembly will also assemble the access tube network the couplings and the modules into the habitation ring those items will be built down here by other aerospace companies and launched ready to be assembled modules can be made by firms who have built modules for the International Space Station fails JAXA Boeing Rose cosmos or Bigelow Aerospace they could also be made by non ISS module makers Orion span axiom the Galactic sweet design orbital technologies and SpaceX there will be two different types of couplings the standard coupler will have three ports one of these joining module and one to the access tube network above there will also be an airlock at the bottom to allow access to the ERV below it the other type of coupling will be the same except below the airlock it will allow access to the reaction control tower with a control spin procession and position of the station as needed all access tubes and couplings will be built by one contractor for commonality there will be two hemispheres of 12 modules each hemisphere will have one krb kitchen restaurant bar one G a gymnasium auditorium and one AWP air water power processing module there will be at least one module for station crew the rest of the modules will be for customer use laboratories for national space agencies hotel rooms for paying guests and villas for those who can afford one this structure could actually be built rather fast why because the Leadenhall building was built fast this is the Leadenhall building the Leadenhall building was built in downtown London and it's considered by many architects as the most advanced building in the world it is the manner in which it was built that makes it so advanced from start to finish it took only 2 years to construct second it was built on a computer using a work schedule that a counter for every bolt tightened every window set in place minute by minute every day seven days a week for two years that is precision scheduling Leadenhall had a small footprint leaving no room for material storage on-site the same problem we have in space this meant every beam every window had to be set in place just when it arrived building von Braun's station will acquire the same kind of precision timing can permanent modular construction be used in space yes the Gateway Foundation has designed and patented a construction machine called the G cell which can build large trusses and frames quickly the docking hub and the outer ring trust are the only parts that need to be welded together in space the rest you just bolt together like they did with the modules at the International Space Station and the frame at leadenhall previously we were looking at mods there were 28 feet wide by 40 feet long these would be very impressive since ISS modules about half that size but if we had a SpaceX super-heavy 2nd stage it was developed just for space construction we can have modules there were 40 feet wide by 60 feet long this much bigger size will allow for a much larger interior volume for the same launch costs each of these modules would be configured to suit the demands of our customers there will be modules for station workers modules designed as laboratories and the modules be configured as hotels for space tourists and then there's my favorite the villa similar to how boeing will customize an airliner frame to create a VIP private jet so to well we have modules fitted for wealthy customers VIP jets can be very plush but this station will have far lower noise levels consistent pressurization and no turbulence or vibration he'll be more like a billionaires yacht well restaurant chains operate the restaurants while hotel chains operate the rooms and the tourist modules imagine what it will do for their loyalty programs if they have a drawing for a free ticket to those who join who could resist the von braun's stations design will laugh the meeting the collaboration of a community of nations with space programs corporations with space objectives and space tourists who want to visit space for a unique offworld experience shared use areas like the restaurants gymnasiums and game rooms will bring these people from different backgrounds together at the same time it will give each of these spaceflight entities the privacy we all need from time to time in their own modules rented spaces or hotel rooms national space agencies who will be able to buy and configure their modules as they see fit and then later sell their positions on the station to recover their expenditure the reselling of space property will completely change the dynamic of space expenditures from all with huge financial losses to one with great financial rewards von braun will be a rotating space station that is economically self-sustaining offering both community and privacy vital low-gravity research and tourism this is the station we need to build right now the Von Braun station first project for orbital assembly to test and use the tools we need to build space ports bots will help astronauts perform repetitious or dangerous tasks pods and arms will move heavy structural items into place drones will perform several jobs all over the construction site and the G cell or trust later or both will assemble large trusses for the structural rings by far the biggest reason to build a von braun's space station is to validate the basic design structure for the gateway spaceport the hub spoke and rim system of building space ports has never been demonstrated offworld and needs to be tested before we build big structures big enough to accommodate cities in space the first part to be built will be the frame does this structure look familiar it should we've done this before down here On June 9th 1893 the Chicago wheel achieved first rotation on this 264 foot wheel there were 36 passenger cars each able to accommodate up to 60 people given a total capacity of 2,000 160 the most famous is the London Eye in the year in 1999 the large hub spoke and rim structure in rotation was put to use in England this magnificent structure is not designed for long-term habitation but it's modern design of hub modules and try and get a ring trust validate the von braun stations major design elements under one gravity stress more such eyes have been built for singapore las vegas 9 Ching and Dubai just as there are more eyes around the world there will be more von Braun stations circling earth there will be eyes in the sky you the von braun's station is almost a reduced scale version of the Gateway spaceport there are literally a hundred ways that building this rotating Space Station will teach us how to build big space ports from power generation and air processing to structural load dynamics on a rotating frame for instance how do we keep the station in balance when a shuttle is offloading cargo in the hub how do we dampen oscillations how do we handle freshwater grey water wastewater how do we recycle air to keep it fresh not just okay but fresh enough for tourists some of those answers will be found in the design of a WP module this modules job will be to clean all the air and water and distribute power from the solar panels as needed to the modules how big does sickbay need to be for a population the size how many refrigerators and freezers for the kitchen the cruise ship industry can answer some of these questions building and operating farm burn station will be an important stepping stone to building bigger structures like space ports how to pay for this station tourists and tenants von braun's station will be just like an apartment building in New York City that has hotels restaurants gymnasiums auditoriums and temporary parking our buildings job will be to provide air water and power to our tenants and gravity but that's free of charge our list of possible tenants and clues number one sovereign customers NASA from America ESA from Europe JAXA from Japan Russia China India Australia Canada South Korea Brazil and more there are 13 nations who have launched rockets into orbital space there are over 70 nations with space programs number two space corporations SpaceX Virgin Galactic Blue Origin Bigelow Aerospace Boeing Lockheed and many more three space societies like as Gardea number for billionaires there are over 2,000 billionaires around the world how many would want to have their own villa offworld the option dome property in orbit has never come up until now with Jeff Bezos Sir Richard Branson bio module with Michael Jordan want to set up a basketball court at lunar gravity Hickey wears Jordans and jump around like that flubber inside there are lots of possibilities who foresaw that the first SpaceX starship client was an artist who wanted to have an experience like no one else has had for over five decades I believe that it'll happen the same way for the Von Braun station maybe even the same person who could resist the chance to have their own villa in space the first privately owned property offworld in history he or she might step out from a profession that is far removed from the space industry number five there is also the person who must have visit space for a few days but does not have enough money to buy their own villa for every billionaire was to visit space there are millions of well-off people who will buy a ticket to the orbital Hilton for a three-day offworld excursion and last number six my favorite is the middle-class person who wants to go to but can't afford to blow the retirement getting there for that person we have created the Gateway foundation crew membership each year we will choose one of these people from the first thousand members and one from the first 10,000 to visit the station at our expense we created the crew membership for lots of good reasons but the biggest one has to do with the powerful force of innovation stemming from human curiosity when everyday people get involved things start to move fast the biggest change this station will bring to space will be a much larger requirement of workers from many sectors of Industry many more scientists will be doing more research more astronauts to build operate and maintain the station more pilots to operate space shuttles space taxis and spacecraft and for the first time we will need workers from many walks of life just to run the station we will have restaurants so we will need waitstaff we will need cooks and we will need people to clean up after they say if you have a bar with footy on the telly then you have to have a brig so we will need security to the rooms will need to be clean and the sheets washed the gymnasium will need instructors to help people from twisting their ankles while they learn that weight is different from mass we will have a doctor or two we will need lots of people and those of you who are part of our gateway crew know that the first place that we look for motivated qualified people who want to be station crew is from our crew membership the Gateway foundation crew membership was created so people who share a passion for space travel could have a significantly higher chance of visiting space in their lifetime but it also gave us a pool of people to draw from who had talents and skills needed for designing and building space stations space ports and other large structures in space this has worked out really well we have been hiring from her crew membership exclusively for over a year now soon after first spin up there will be a need for other types of space stations nearby to help Van Brunt station function maintenance facilities will be need to repair shovels that loose tiles and reentry shielding or need viola components replaced there will be fueling depots and stations for service craft - well national space agencies want to have zero-g laboratories and co / la positions so they're scientists living there can get some exercise and good food every few days at least our weekends I would think so we first started making our cost projections for space construction we've based it upon the lowest estimated launch cost that we could find the space xbf are at a thousand dollars a kilogram that came out to around 150 million dollars a launch but then Elon Musk made a presentation and a delight that changed everything by making all the components of bfr reusable its cost could be spread over many flights just like an airliner Elon Musk estimates launch cost to the starship and super heavy booster at around seven million dollars some estimate that each launch will be as high as 40 million dollars after all the factors are accounted for but whether it's seven or forty million dollars that is still music to our ears this means it rotating space stations maintenance facilities and fuel depots can and will be built affordably NASA wants to go back to the moon but it really needs to learn about the long-term effects of low gravity - now they can afford to do both we will build von Braun's station and it could be built fast because many can afford to have a module at these prices my father's generations sent people to the moon when we build von braun's station we will make history - first rotation will be a monumental event much like the first steps on the moon but when the station first spins up there may be close to 400 people on board heads of state billionaires in the space industry and many celebrities the names of the first people to experience artificial gravity in space for the first time in history will be remembered as that who was there a moment for generations you don't want to miss this party if you are a gateway foundation crew member that at least two of you will be there that's in addition to any crew members who were hired as station crew well NASA and International Space Agency's by modules on bond brunt station yes because they will want to remain the leading nations in space exploration and low gravity research will tell us how we need to design spacecraft to explore our solar system for centuries to come the future of human space exploration is in rotation space has been one of America's most important areas of investment and technological dominance for decades but the importance of the station goes far beyond monetary investment an ROI it is the symbol of things to come it is affordable and revolutionary I believe America is a superpower that needs a super project this country has never done better than one has accepted the challenge of a great undertaking that would change everything the spacex starship the von braun rotating space station will usher in an era of space habitation and space communities long dreamed of but never attained we have the technology to build the station and it is economically feasible this is going to happen because as time has come and it could happen fast because a lot of the things that we need are already made or can be fabricated with off-the-shelf materials and technology once again I would like to thank the Gateway foundation crew members who supported this effort and those who have joined us recently you were helping us a lot and we listened to your ideas now I want to tell you a little bit about our crew we are not from a few nations we're from all over the world in fact it's only a matter of time before we have Gateway foundation crew members representing every nation on earth we are a team with a common objective to form a space construction industry to create transportation infrastructure offworld and to transition humankind into a spacefaring race if you'd like to join our crew go to Gateway space port comm slash membership our next episode will focus on the design challenges dr. Thomas bilker and I have addressed on the von braun's station for the last eight months thank you for watching and be sure and subscribe to our Channel you"
moonlanding,"APOLLO'S DARING MISSION NOVA Documentary
The lunar landing site was the Taurus-Littrow highlands and valley area. This site was picked for Apollo 17 as a location where rocks both older and younger than those previously returned from other Apollo missions, as well as from Luna 16 and 20 missions, might be found.

The mission was the final in a series of three J-type missions planned for the Apollo Program. These J-type missions can be distinguished from previous G- and H-series missions by extended hardware capability, larger scientific payload capacity and by the use of the battery-powered Lunar Roving Vehicle, or LRV.

Scientific objectives of the Apollo 17 mission included, geological surveying and sampling of materials and surface features in a preselected area of the Taurus-Littrow region; deploying and activating surface experiments; and conducting in-flight experiments and photographic tasks during lunar orbit and transearth coast. These objectives included deployed experiments, such as the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package, or ALSEP, with a heat flow experiment; lunar seismic profiling, or LSP; lunar surface gravimeter, or LSG; lunar atmospheric composition experiment, or LACE; and lunar ejecta and meteorites, or LEAM. The mission also included lunar sampling and lunar orbital experiments. Biomedical experiments included the Biostack II experiment and the BIOCORE experiment.

Mission Highlights

At 9:15:29 a.m. GMT Dec. 7, 1972, the command and service module, or CSM, was separated from the S-IVB. Approximately 15 min later, the CSM docked with the lunar module, or LM. After CSM/LM extraction from the S-IVB, the S-IVB was targeted for lunar impact, which occurred Dec. 10, at 8:32:43 p.m. The impact location was approximately 84 nautical miles northwest of the planned target point and the event was recorded by the passive seismic experiments deployed on the Apollos 12, 14, 15 and 16 missions.

Only one of the four planned midcourse corrections was required during translunar coast. A midcourse correction made at 5:03 p.m. Dec. 8, was a 1.6 second service propulsion system burn resulting in a 10 :5 feet second velocity change. Lunar orbit insertion was accomplished at 7:47:23 p.m. Dec. 10, placing the spacecraft into a lunar orbit of 170 by 52.6 nautical miles. Approximately four hours, 20 minutes later, the orbit was reduced to 59 by 15 nautical miles. The spacecraft remained in this low orbit for more than 18 hours, during which time the CSM LM undocking and separation were performed. The CSM circularization maneuver was performed at 6:50:29 p.m. Dec. 11, which placed the CSM into an orbit of 70.3 by 54.3 nautical miles. At 2:35 p.m. Dec. 11, the commander and lunar module pilot entered the LM to prepare for descent to the lunar surface. At 6:55:42 p.m. Dec. 11, the LM was placed into an orbit with a perilune altitude of 6.2 nautical miles. Approximately 47 minutes later, the powered descent to the lunar surface began. Landing occurred at 7:54:57 p.m. Dec. 11, at lunar latitude 20 degrees, 10 minutes north, and longitude 30 degrees 46 minutes east. Apollo 17 was the last lunar landing mission. Three extravehicular activities, or EVAs, lasted a total of 22 hours, four minutes on the lunar surface. EVA No. 1 began at 11:54:49 p.m. Dec. 11, with Eugene Cernan egressing at 12:01 a.m. Dec. 12. The first EVA was seven hours, 12 minutes long and was completed at 7:06:42 a.m. Dec. 12. The second EVA began at 11:28:06 p.m. Dec. 12, and lasted seven hours, 37 minutes, ending at at 7:05:02 a.m. Dec. 13. The final EVA began at 10:25:48 p.m. Dec. 13, and ended at 5:40:56 a.m. Dec. 14.

mission on a dangerous new course passenger what that's the craziest idea I ever heard lot of risk untried technologies put to the test any one of them can be a disaster if it doesn't go perfectly well it's the height of the Cold War two superpowers raced to the moon they've been beating us at every turn I want to be part of winning a president's deadline there's just enormous pressure then tragedy strikes how are we ever gonna get there a secret decision is made he said close the door so I realized that something must big a half-century later the legacy of this audacious journey affects a small the mission that got us to the moon Apollo's daring mission right now on Nova major funding for Nova is provided by the following I'm at the predator water it is perhaps the greatest technological feat in history humans arriving in another world yet before the arriving could happen first there was believing it's December 1968 a space mission unlike any other begins Apollo 8 it was the most dangerous mission of all it was the boldest move that NASA ever made three men Frank Borman Jim Lovell and Bill Anders are departing on a journey no one has ever made before for the first time in human history humans left earth all previous missions have stayed in Earth orbit but these three veteran fighter pilots Lovell from the Navy Borman and Anders from the Air Force will take their spacecraft to another world Apollo eight will orbit the moon ten times it will not land but this mission will make the landing possible by testing key technologies needed to reach the moon a giant rocket a redesigned spacecraft a revolutionary new computer the rocket has never carried humans before the spacecraft and computer have only flown once on Apollo 7 a mere 180 miles off Earth's surface Apollo eight we'll take these untied technologies on a half million miles round-trip in the ultimate test we probably had one chance of three of making a successful flight and one chance and three of not being able to do our mission but at least making it home alive and one chance in three of not making it back it is a giant risk but originally Apollo 8 was supposed to be a baby step just another test flight around the earth it took years of test flights and you really have to think of course of the Apollo flights as a system there's a typical NASA inch-by-inch one step at a time approach but in the summer of 1968 years of careful planning and preparation are suddenly upended by an alarming discovery we were training California the three of us bill myself and Frank when suddenly Frank got called back to Houston deke Slayton said Frank I want you back ground used to rock right away uh I have to discuss something with you deke Slayton is in charge of the astronauts and so I said well dick let's discuss it now I'm busy I do it over the phone and he reminded me who was boss things weren't gentle and politically correct in those days we weren't candy asses okay and so I went back to Houston and he said close the door so I realized that something was big a CIA spy satellite has photographed an enormous Soviet rocket on a launch pad it can mean only one thing the CIA had information that the Soviets were planning on sending a man around the moon in the year of 1968 a Soviet cosmonaut reaching the moon would be a stunning defeat for America for years the US and Soviet Union both armed with nuclear weapons have been locked in a deadly Cold War there was a sense that communism was a profound threat to democracy and to the United States starting in 1957 with Sputnik the Soviets open a new front space Yuri Gagarin valentina Tereshkova blow after blow after blow they blew beating us at every turn in April 1961 a new president John Kennedy writes a memo about space that will have profound consequences he said guys find me something we can beat the Russians out now it is time to take longer strides I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth Kennedy has set a firm deadline the end of the 1960s it was a simple one-sentence statement the goal and the schedule clear it's the same no fuzz oh let go I never joined NASA to explore space yeah basic I was a military person and it was clear to me that we were in a serious confrontation with the Soviets I wanted to be part of winning military test pilots now astronauts begin flying in 1961 by 1967 Americans have mastered the basics of space flight and all the techniques needed to reach the moon Apollo America's moon program is about to take its first step Apollo 1 will be a test of the new spacecraft the command module around the earth the crew is Gus Grissom America's second man in space ed white who took America's first space walk and Roger Chaffee a Navy pilot who flew airborne photography missions during the Cuban Missile Crisis three weeks before launch a dress rehearsal on the ground a practice countdown it's January 27th 1967 a Friday things are not going well that was the end of a very frustrating day they were having communication problems with the crew when all of a sudden he ought thought I heard far the fire quickly becomes an inferno and I know the rest is history with no chance of escape poisoned by toxic fumes three astronauts perish it was a pretty sad thing most of the guys were we're sitting on their consoles tears running down their cheeks you know just couldn't believe what had happened everybody knew what they were doing was dangerous but they didn't really think of it as being dangerous on the ground and it was a huge shock that an accident like this would happen in a time of ordinary training scenario without being in space over the next few months the charged spacecraft is painstakingly disassembled each piece tagged studied and photographed five thousand images in all sifting through these artifacts the Apollo review board pieces together what went wrong we came out with a scathing report on the problems not only of the test in which the fire occurred but also in the development of the spacecraft there was no ass covering there was a lot of soul-searching as to what had happened and all of the things that went with it electrical wiring shows shoddy workmanship investigators believe the fire began with a spark from a wire that had rubbed bear that spark quickly became an inferno because the command module was full of flammable material everywhere you turned there were stuff that would be subject to a flash fire if he got a right ignition source on top of that the atmosphere inside could not have been more dangerous pure oxygen add 16 pounds per square inch something which we all should have known that anything will burn at pure oxygen at 16 pounds per square inch and finally the hatch it's cumbersome to unlock and it opens inward expanding gases from the searing heat meant tons of force held the hatch closed the fire is a shock to the system that reverberates throughout Apollo it caused NASA to stop and reflect on everything it was doing and redo it but for the fire there would have been the re-examination of all kinds of things we redouble their efforts we said you know those guys were our friends and we're going to get to the moon on time and their honor but getting to the moon on time won't be easy they've got to completely redesign the command module perfect a lunar lander figure out how to navigate to the moon and back and build a rocket larger and more powerful than any that has ever flown it will be known as the Saturn 5 the key and innovation that enabled all of Apollo was the Saturn 5 rocket without that you couldn't even say we were going to the moon it will weigh over six million pounds stand as tall was a 36 story building and be able to lift a hundred and thirty tons America's moon rocket is the brainchild of German engineer fair nirvan Brown during World War two von Braun and his team developed the v2 rocket built with slave labor v2 rockets kill thousands in London Antwerp and elsewhere after the war von Braun is brought to the u.s. to build rockets for America the Saturn 5 will be the biggest ever built if it can be built to get this enormous machine off the ground will require a new engine ten times more powerful than any ever design it will be called the f1 sunny mariah is project manager in June 1962 when NASA test fires its first f1 when you tried to fire it for the first time which is blue apart as f1 engines keep blowing up engineers finally identify the problem combustion instability and uneven burning if you visualize a candle burning in a room it flickers from side to side well that's a form of instability what happens there is that it sees more oxygen on one side and so it produces more heat and it pushes the flame over to the side well that flips back and forth maybe five or six times in a second that same phenomena happens in our f1 engine but they don't flip it five times in a second they put two thousand times in a second like a massive out-of-control candle the fire inside the f1 surges back and forth until it destroys the engine they have no idea how to fix it the f1 engine is simply too far ahead of the state-of-the-art and too enormous to apply any known theory the solution had to come by trial and error you know you find a way or make one that's why it was back then it was absolutely the seat of our pants if they can't fix the f1 Apollo is finished if we couldn't solve the combustion instability problem we would not have gone to the moon was too risky we would have killed a bunch of astronauts trying to make that work so the engineers turned to von Browns original v2 why didn't combustion instability destroy that engine in the v2 you perhaps adding metal ridges baffles to the injector plate would create a similar effect in the f1 we broke that into segments with baffles hopefully they wouldn't talk to each other similar to what the the v2 had after many experiments with baffles eventually they get the engine to run smoothly lo and behold we found out that the baffles were able to attenuate the oscillations but how can they be certain the f1 will work every time they try deliberately causing the problem by setting off a small explosion inside the engine while it's running can baffles stop instability after it starts we drove it unstable with a bomb we've inserted a bomb right into the son of the injected and blew it just at the time we ignite it with the engine running the small bomb explodes the burning becomes unstable but in a fraction of a second the baffles quickly stop or dampen the instability that would drive the engine unstable and then it would dampen out right away where before it wouldn't and every single time those baffles dampen to help the oscillations in November 1967 two years and one month before Kennedy's deadline the Saturn 5 rocket has its first unmanned test flight we got as close to it as we could something like two and a half miles away among the spectators is astronaut Michael Collins when the engines ignited didn't seem like a big deal and then of a shockwave came and the shockwave gotcha in the viscera got you in the brain got you shaky if you ever want to know what power meant that was it the five that f1 engines and everything else work perfectly but leaving earth on a rocket is just the start to reach the moon they'll have to cross a quarter million miles of empty space and hit a target that's only about 2,000 miles across in space everything is moving around I mean the earth is moving around the Sun moon is rotating around the earth there's all this movement so how do you hit the target to hit the moon NASA turns to Charles stark Draper better known as dark engineer aviation pioneer MIT professor stark Draper was the leader of the instrumentation lab at MIT Massachusetts Institute of Technology very technical guy who is put together this intricate bunch of equipment starting in the 1930s Draper develops a new way for pilots to always know where they are even at night in fog or thick clouds inertial navigation it allows a pilot to navigate from point A to point B without knowing any information other than where he started but on earth points a and B are stationary with respect to each other in space there are two different celestial bodies earth and moon and both are constantly moving to reach the moon Apollo will have to speed up slow down change direction multiple times so Apollo needs the most accurate navigation system possible it will have several parts the first is the inertial measurement unit inside gyroscopes measure changes in direction accelerometers changes in speed starting at the launch in Cape Canaveral Florida by measuring every change in speed and direction it keeps track of the spacecraft's location but it's not perfect gyroscopes and accelerometers are mechanical devices each day a little bit of error creeps in in long missions like Apollo 8 the inertial measurement unit isn't quite cost that it does drift a little bit so the second part of the system is a check on the inertial unit a way to correct its daily error the Apollo space sextant after about a day you want to have somebody go to the Sexson in the wall of the spacecraft site on a couple of stars and then basically correct the orientation with the space accent the Navigator can determine the spacecraft's location by measuring the angle between a reference star and the edge of the earth knowing that angle he can use trigonometry to calculate his position in space together the inertial measurement unit and space accident combined with ground tracking will tell astronauts and Mission Control where they are but knowing where they are is only half the battle they'll have to maneuver into and out of lunar orbit and MIT thinks that's too hard for a human pilot it can all be done by a computer it's just two buttons one button will say go to moon and one button will say take me home the astronauts respectfully disagree no no no I'm up there it's my rear end that's on the line I need to be in control of the spacecraft the very first thing one of the astronauts said to me as soon as we get up there we're shutting their sucker off but maneuvering the Apollo spacecraft involves firing 16 different thrusters plus the main engine so you better have 17 fingers and be awfully awfully agile after a long battle NASA decides the astronauts will control a computer and it will maneuver the spacecraft a system called digital fly-by-wire fly by wire is where the pilot is really controlling a model inside the computer and then the computer does whatever it needs to do to make the spacecraft fly like that model the inertial measurement unit the space sextant and ground tracking pinpoint where the spacecraft is the computer knows where they want to go so it figures out how to burn the thrusters plus the main engine to get there human life will be entrusted to decisions made by a machine persons life was at stake in this case the astronaut so had to work Margaret Hamilton develops software that will control the Apollo computer computers don't do anything until they have some instructions that is the software side of things Hamilton and her team will have to create software that enables this computer to prioritize different tasks without freezing weed the developers had to assign unique priorities to every job and if there's an emergency we want to interrupt everybody and say look I'm coming in here for something that's an emergency everybody else gets downgraded and there's still one more requirement for this new computer it must be tiny the way that the size of the computer got determined was not about what it had to do out of the blue they said oh here's a cubic foot fill it with computer computer in the 1950's meant something that was basically the size of a building it seems completely impossible but lead designer Eldon Hall thinks a new breakthrough in electronics might just be what they need Eldon Hall said the only way we're going to get small enough low far enough and reliable enough is to switch to integrated circuits integrated circuits shrink hundreds of transistors and other components down into one tiny chip but can such a computer be built not only small but able to prioritize tasks easy to use and 100% reliable as the summer of 1968 arrives barely 18 months remain until the Kennedy deadline then the CIA brings the shocking news that the Soviets are poised to send a man around the moon rather than lose to the Soviets Apollo spacecraft manager George Lowe proposes a radical change of mission instead of orbiting the Earth the original plan send Apollo 8 a half million miles to the moon and back I say what that's the craziest idea I ever heard Chris Kraft director of Mission Control orders engineer Jerry Bostick to study the possibility this was a Friday find a credenza man fat he said you've got until Monday morning to figure out if we can do it or not the command module redesigned after the fire still hasn't flown the guidance computer hasn't been tested in space and the Saturn 5 which did so well on its first unmanned test flight had major problems on its second still the engineers conclude this new mission might just work we recognize it yes this is not gonna be a piece of cake but we can pull it off the improved command module now with better wiring a new easy to open hatch and no more pure oxygen on the ground will be tested around the earth first on Apollo 7 if that works Apollo 8 will go to the moon all of a sudden Jim and Bill and I have became frantically training for the lunar mission NASA usually went step by step in this case they jumped three or four steps I thought that was a grand idea this was exploration this was a mini Lewis and Clark expedition in October 1968 the redesigned command module was tested around the earth and performs perfectly Apollo eight will proceed but first a final review where engineers report to management and astronauts can you give this a clean bill of health and we have a safe mission ahead of us because of your hardware well we had gone through all this combustion instability stuff with many unknowns and I couldn't say you know Frank Morton put his arm around me and he said Sonny he says we know you guys have done everything humanly possible to make this a safe flight we are ready to fly don't worry about now Apollo eight will go it's December 21st 1968 the morning of the loss I thought to myself we're going to the moon this is good up go to the moon they prepared as much as possible still this launch is an act of faith whether it turns out to be a desperate gamble that should never have been made or a stroke of genius Apollo 8 is a leap into the unknown first on the Saturn 5 first to leave the earth first you go into lunar orbit a lot of risk without nervous yes I was nervous that's a big step it's a big step ten nine eight seconds to go we have ignition sequence start fuel starts pumping 15 tonnes each second the f1 engines come alive it was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves think and even see the instrument panel it was vibrating so much it was one hell of a rocket you have seven and half million pounds of thrust pushing you all of a sudden it stops and you're one forward in here's your seat belts and then back as the second stage took over eleven and a half minutes after leaving the ground Apollo eight is moving 17,000 miles an hour circling the earth then an unprecedented and momentous event the third stage engine will relight and send Apollo 8 out of Earth orbit toward the moon it's a manoeuvre NASA calls TOI translunar injection translunar injection it sounds like some sort of a medical device astronaut Michael Collins is Capcom the one person in Mission Control who speaks directly to the astronauts I mean I love NASA but they have an ability to transform sometime the ethereal into the mundane in this moment Michael Collins has the honor of announcing a turning point in human history I said to them Apollo eight you're go for tli and Borman said a Roger Houston that was it I just really wish I had that moment to live over again because I would have said to them Apollo 8 you can now slip the surly bonds of Earth and dance the sky Apollo 8 dance the sky you go is what I would have said to them instead of you're cleared for tli the words may be mundane but the meaning is profound was the first time that any human beings entered the gravitational field of another planetary body besides the one that we evolved on two and a half days past even now the astronauts still can't see their destination our bluntslide restores the mode so we never saw the moon as we actually got right up to it but they don't need to see the moon just yet to go into lunar orbit they have to fire their engine and slow down to be captured by the moon's gravity everything about it must be perfect if not they could miss the moon or crash into it and all this done by the computer the computer has to figure how to turn the spacecraft so the rocket is pointing in the right direction it then has to figure exactly when it has to be lit it has to be precisely calculated it all needs to be timed within tenths of a second but the computer only does this when the astronaut tells it to so in 1968 with no mouse touchscreen or keyboard how will an astronaut talk to the computer mi t--'s answer is the display keyboard or dis key it has a numeric keypad and a very simple what you would think of now as an LED display the real genius of the disk heat is the way it uses language engineer Ramon Alonso was raised in Argentina trying to create this language he remembers how he learned English when you go in school somebody said you know the parts of speech a part of of sentences their sectional verbs just in school nouns what is a verb well that's the action that does something and what is a noun is a thing so all right that seemed to suit I remember driving to work one time and say oh yeah that might work fire rocket fire would be the knee - and rocket would be 35 or something like that and display time and display might be 16 and time would be 45 the disky was designed for idiots like me I mean we had verbs and nouns so that it made more sense to us very crude it was but it certainly did the job now almost three days after launch the Apollo guidance computer and it's dis he interface are about to execute their first life-and-death maneuver we're coming up to what is known as LOI lunar orbit insertion the computer must fire the engine at just the right moment in just the right direction for a precise number of seconds to drop Apollo 8 into the perfect orbit if you burn too much you could go in too low an orbit that could intersect the moon or you could fly off into an orbit that won't come back around there's a tremendous amount of danger with getting these orbital burns right the LOI burn happens when Apollo 8 is behind the moon radio signals will be blocked all communication cut off the break in communications is sharp the trajectory engineers can tell you based on the geometry and all the velocities exactly one that was going to happen this was a very important parameter because it would tell you that when you lost you communications if you were on trajectory or not everyone counts down the minutes to loss of signal l OS there was nothing to say you're just sitting there and as quiet as a mouse at the exact second we were supposed to lose communications we lost it and I said something I we must be right on right on time I said yeah Frank had checked yeah I said but you know there are friends down there they're gonna pull the plug on that intent in no matter how far off we are they probably turned off the damn radio for the next 35 minutes there's nothing Mission Control can do Apollo eight is behind the moon and unreachable it was almost a relief first of all we've been sitting there for three or four hours with no bathroom break so the first thing you do is he hit the doors up in space a different kind of break we saw nothing we were upside down and backwards in perfect darkness until he rotated the spacecraft around suddenly we look down and there Louis was the lunar surface you know we're like preschool kids look at into a candy store window for the first time ever human eyes are seeing the far side of the Moon on earth Mission Control won't know if the burn to go into lunar orbit worked or not until radio contact resumes so we're sitting there waiting for them to come out and have acquisition of signal to see whether or not we all needed to jump into action because if it went badly we really didn't have much time to do something puppey Northcutt is part of a support team that will have to quickly compute emergency maneuvers to bring apollo 8 home if the burn failed it was dead silent except for hearing the Capcom calling out Apollo 8 this is Houston Apollo 8 this is Houston the burn worked behind the moon the computer-oriented the spacecraft and fired the engine at just the right moment for just the right time 60 by a hundred and seventy miles is the elliptical orbit they want to end up in and they end up with like sixty point five and a hundred and sixty nine point nine miles I mean it's incredibly close super accurate burn over the next 20 hours Apollo eight will circle the moon ten times it's Christmas Eve before leaving the moon they'll show millions on earth the view out the window with a live television broadcast that almost never happened I was against it I didn't even want to take a television camera I was stupid fortunately the people at NASA overruled me because the American people and the people on the earth had every right to see what we were seeing but what should they say while showing the view I was told while you're in orbit around the moon on Christmas Eve you'll have the largest audience that's ever listened to a human voice I said gene what do you want us to do the response was do something appropriate I'll never forget that can you imagine that happening today we thought could we change the words to the night before Christmas now make it more contemporary how about something in the way of jingle bells nothing that we could come up with seemed appropriate we asked each other we asked our wives we asked France cool in the end it's Christine Layton Washington insider and wife of writer Joe Laden who has the answer and she said well why not you start at the beginning and hey somebody made it she said Genesis anybody knew they were not beans of it and God divided the light from the darkness memorable things in my life I guess it was the higher stood up on the back of my back the first impression I had was how appropriate what could be better than having the first human beings Americans certainly in the minute Christmas Eve and they read the story of creation from Genesis and it brought tears to my eyes you just drained for millions on earth the Christmas Eve television broadcast is the defining moment of Apollo 8 but for the engineers and especially the astronauts there's a critical maneuver just ahead that overshadows everything else coming home trans earth injection is the engine burn that will send Apollo 8 out of lunar orbit and back toward Earth we're captured by the boom that means that unless that engine works to get us out of here we could be here for a lot longer is that engine got to work again there's only one engine no better it has baked in sunlight 250 degrees above zero frozen in darkness 250 below if the nozzle on the hinge and somehow overheated or cracked or something there's nothing too bad he lose the print again the burn will be controlled by the computer and take place behind the moon again they lose radio contact no one on the ground will know if it worked until they acquires signal just watching that clock and wondering what happened when they were on the backside of the moon what happened again the engine worked for the next two and a half days Apollo eight will coast toward Earth navigator Jim Lovell updates their position with space sextant and disc II so far it's been flawless but MIT software engineer Margaret Hamilton has a nagging worry how to prevent errors what if the astronaut typed something wrong into the disk II my daughter Lauren would come in often and would play astronaut associates are pressing keys and I remember one time all of a sudden big crash everything stopped so I'm thinking what did she press she had selected po1 during flight p01 tells the computer that it's backed on the launch pad waiting to start the mission if an astronaut enters that into the disky during flight the computer will forget where they are in space this could happen on a real mission we've to stop the astronaut from being able to select feel one during flight and NASA said you know these are the most highly trained test pilots in the world they're never gonna make a mistake but of course they do a day and a half away from Earth Jim Lovell is using the space sextant and disk aid to update their position suddenly Lovell said all Lovell is doing a star sighting and he's entering star number one and by mistake he enters program number one I got into a program that essentially told me I was back on the launch site waiting to take off Borman wakes up what's going on here the computer starts trying to reposition the command module thinking they're back at Cape Canaveral those things started turning on this and Anders didn't know what was going on oh he was bad glowy you lost it you lost it I said well don't worry about it using the space Sexton Lovell Orient's the navigation system again putting it back on track just one of those things you know you never trust in Annapolis graduate Rafer a day and a half later Apollo 8 re-enters the Earth's atmosphere at nearly seven miles per second 10 minutes after that on December 27th 1968 they splashed down into the Pacific Ocean the Saturn 5 rocket the redesigned command module the guidance computer all have worked perfectly we accomplished just about everything that you need to do to land on the moon except the landing itself this is the moment that the space race ends once we do Apollo 8 the Soviets are out of the running seven months later Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are walking on the moon thanks in large part to Apollo 8 Apollo 11 walked on the moon Holloway was about leaving if you consider the leaving and the arriving both of them necessary steps I think the two flights were about equal in their historical significance the legacy of this overlooked mission is profound of all the Apollo technologies perhaps the one that touches more of us in our everyday lives than any other is its pioneering computer this was a major moment in the role of computers in the world and computers being able to let us do things that we can't do any other way with it's disky and guidance computer Apollo paved the way for keyboards mice touchscreens computer-controlled airliners factories smartphones and more now we have digital computers in everything this was the first digital computer in almost anything now we stake our lives on software this was the first time people stake their lives on software yet it's an old analog technology that gives us the most profound legacy of Apollo 8 assigned to photograph future landing sites on the moon bill Anders is stunned by something else that's completely unexpected when the earth came up in earth rise I didn't even have a light meter no I just started clicking away and changing the F stops and fortunately one of the pictures came out that picture is probably the picture of the century we thought we were going there for studying the moon now we went to the moon we learned a lot about the moon but most of all we learned about a new way to look at the earth the sense of isolation and closeness of our humanity I wish more people would focus on having that unifying experience I think was a very profound and moving moment for the people on earth to realize we're all on this one spaceship together we better start taking care of it before all this seeing our home planet as it really is and everything else the rocket the computer leaving Earth had only been dreamed of in December 1968 it became forever real on Apollo 8 this was the mission that all that happened you you New Horizons the spacecraft that brought us to Pluto now in the farthest reaches of our solar system can it complete another mission a close encounter with a mysterious object from the distant past Pluto and beyond next time on Nova major funding for Nova is provided by the following to order

 ""The Imitation Game"" starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan
 Turing and Keira Knightley as one of the the team that 
 worked with Turing -  her name was Joan Clarke. Alan Turing worked at the Government Code
 and Cypher Centre at Bletchley Park throughout the war, right from when it
 broke out in 1939 right through until the end the war 
 in 1945. Alan Turing was at Princeton doing
 research with another very famous mathematical logician called
 Alonzo Church. He returned from Princeton in 1938 but
 even in that year, from '38 to '39, it's very clear that he was contacted by GC & CS even though he wasn't employed by them.
 And became a sort of consultant; became acquainted with all
 the difficulties that were going to hit the Allies when war broke out
 - as seemed  inevitable - in deciphering German ciphers that had been done on this Enigma
 machine. Now an awful lot of the material that I'm going to be using today, really,
 uses as a reference book this one by Andrew Hodges. It's called 
 ""Alan Turing - the enigma"" This has been reprinted, republished - I
 think in a slightly newer edition - because ""The Imitation Game"" is based on this account of Turing's life.
 Now, Enigma goes back a long way. Prior to its use by the German armed
 forces it was just a simple commercial cipher machine and it was a pretty
 reasonable system but I suppose you could say the number of
 possibilities - the degree to which it scrambled up the
 message, was considerable but not ultra, ultra safe, I think it was a machine that - as they
 say in the cryptological trade - was designed to discourage casual snooping rather than to withstand serious
 attention from experts in the field. And what I want to do is to go through
 with you, in this video, the components of the system and then in
 the later one summarise and say: ""That's the problem
 they were up against - how do you make a machine that could
 help you decipher that code if you didn't know the settings
 of the machines that created it in the first place?"" I'm going to cross-refer
 you to some footage on our sister channel, Numberphile. James Grime has done a couple
 of videos, on Numberphile, which actually use
 a real-live Enigma machine that belongs to Simon Singh. Lucky James gets to use the real thing
 and I would strongly recommend, if you're puzzled by all of this, go and 
 watch those two videos. One of them is just a generalized introduction to the Enigma, the other one 
 explains precisely why the Enigma machine's big flaw was that it
 could never encipher a letter as itself. Believe it or
 not that is a big, big security flaw, and does provide a way in, for people who
 want to crack that particular code. The Enigma itself looks, at first sight, a bit
 like an ordinary typewriter. It's got a typewriter board layout, there's typewriter keys, but you then notice that if you switch it on - and
 it is battery powered - in the area just above the keys, instead of having
 26 further keys, you have 26 places where a lamp can light up a letter. So you might press a T and it will light 
 up as a G. What else is there, inside this machine. How
 does the key-press get through to illuminating a lamp? Well
 in the most amazing and convoluted way. There's a set of rotors here. These
 rotors have 26 alphabetic letters engraved around the circumference.
 Sometimes you don't get letters you get numbers 0, 1, ... through to 26, but it 
 comes down to the same thing in the end. When the lid is closed on top of them
 the letter - as it were - pointing upwards on the rotor anywhere between A to Z, shows up in
 three identical looking windows. Perhaps the easiest way
 to think of it - even for those of you viewing who are relatively 
 young - can you remember back to your family's first ever car? Where it had an old-fashioned
 odometer, you know, a mileage indicator on the dashboard which wasn't all done in electronics, it
 was actually driven off the engine and you actually had little wheels
 moving in front of you? On the right-hand side would be the tenths
 of a mile, or tenths of a kilometre, and every time that had got 
 up to a 9 it would nudge the dial to the left of it, to move on one
 place, and so on. The principle is exactly the same on the Enigma. The right-hand rotor moves the fastest and at a certain stage will nudge the
 next one into moving on a notch. The left hand
 rotor is the slowest moving of all and once the lid is closed on the Enigma, all
 you see is the letter on the rotor that's uppermost showing through the windows at the top. Now - complication upon complication, Within each rotor there is, if you like, on the two sides, an input stud and
 an output stud, and they are cross-wired. If you could 
 break open as is shown here, the rotor mechanism, you would see a whole bunch of 26 wires, in there, which are cross-wiring an input stud to an output stud. So you might get A, cross wired to J, B cross-wired to Q, C cross-wired to W - something like that.
 When Enigma first came out there were three sorts of rotor wheel numbered I, II, and III, in Roman
 numerals, typically, in the German instruction manuals. 
 A rotor of type II would not be cross-wired in the same way as a rotor of type I. And similarly
 a rotor of type III would be a completely different cross-wiring. I think many of you will know the number of ways
 you can arrange three things on a spindle like that is 3 factorial, which is 6.  Six possible 
 orderings of the rotors on the spindle. So you can begin to see the multiplication 
 of the number of combinations about how this thing could be set
 up in the first place. You've got different orderings on the spindle;
 you've got different cross-wirings on the different sorts of rotors. So for the very basic machine, then, that was just about it. You fed the signals through the right-most rotor
 through the middle rotor with a different cross-wiring and mapping, through the
 left-hand rotor and then there was what the Germans called
 a 'reverser', sometimes in English called the 'reflector'.
 What it would do was to return the signal back via a different stud on the left-hand rotor so it would take a
 different journey back through the machine to the
 way it came in. Now here is the secret of why it never mapped a letter to itself. It
 couldn't because, to make that effect happen, you'd have had
 in the reflector drum here, to say ""Ah! it's coming out of the A slot;
 I'm going to return it back through the A slot"". It wasn't electrically
 set up to enable you to do that. You effectively had
 to decide to cross-wire in that reflector to something different. And I think, here,
 if you look carefully A is actually cross-wired to something like W. Now, in the early 3-rotor Enigma, that
 reflector had fixed cross-wirings which were the same in all Enigma machines. So, your current goes back through a different route and then, finally, lights up a lamp
 on the lamp array just ahead on the keyboard. over here  So that's 
 the way it was up until about the mid-thirties. But then, as the German armed forces were
 taking more and more interest in these things, and saying: ""Oh, if we could beef
 them up these could be made into military grade security devices"", they did two things. First thing, they said we're not just going to have three rotors in six combinations, we're  going to do the
 following: were going to invent two more rotors called IV and V, amazingly :-) 
 Here's what you now do: We will choose any three out of those five rotors - well the ways of picking three from five is
 five times four over one times two But for each of those 10 ways, you can still
 jumble them up in six ways on the spindle. Ten times six is sixty, so classic Army-Airforce Enigma used this pretty well throughout the war.
 You chose three from five and the three you chose could be put on 
 the spindle in a certain way. Now comes the real killer. If that wasn't bad enough, the armed forces decided that on the input to the machine and on the output they would have another cross-wiring
 board, called the Plugboard. Now this one's simple to understand. It's
 basically got sockets numbered from A to Z and you're given
 chunks of wire. If the instructions say crosslink A to J, that's what you did. Crosslink B to R, you did that as well. In usual 
 operating practice 10 out of 13 of those plugs would be cross-wired and wired up. You could
 wire up in the pairs but you didn't absolutely have to wire up everything. If
 you left something unwired - or 'unsteckered' as they would say in German - then that's fine. I mean a letter Q might have
 no plug in it - going absolutely nowhere. Fine. So Q maps to Q - it's not altered
 to anything else at all. But, like I said, typically 10 out of 13
 would be wired up. So this is getting to be a pretty
 complex machine now and you would think: ""By golly! surely this
 is enough security for anybody?"" Well, what's good enough for the Army and the Air Force in almost
 any armed forces in the world is never good enough for the Navy! I think
 it's that case in the UK - it's certainly that way in the US, and it certainly was that way in Germany.
 Admiral Karl Doenitz who was the head of the German Navy, was a very smart guy. Some
 people theorize - and maybe they're right - that he strongly suspected as the war went on, that maybe Army and
 Airforce Enigma was being decrypted successfully, sometimes, by the
 Allies, and he was determined to make the German Navy version of Enigma 
 far harder. So, first thing he did was to say: ""All right,
 we'll stick with three rotors for the moment but it isn't choose 3 from 5, it's choose 3 from 8"", And and by the time you've worked it out, how many ways to pick 3 from 8,
 and then multiply by 6 for the number of ways you can arrange the three you've 
 chosen on the spindle, the answer is 336. And that's daunting! One of the things, I think,
 does need a bit of careful explanation - it's not very well done in the various books about Bletchley Park
 and Enigma, and how it worked - is to explain what these so-called 'ring
 settings' were. Now the straightforward, internal, 
 cross-wiring is simple: you just look at the top row and for every
 letter you follow vertically downwards and you say: ""Okay, in
 a Type I rotor A on one side gets mapped to E on the opposite side. B gets mapped to K; C gets mapped to M - all the way through to  Z gets mapped to J "". But to complicate 
 matters just a little bit further every one of these rotor rings had a
 little blob of paint associated with it showing which was the proper setting. with A at
 the top and A against the dot of paint, but it had the ability to be able to turn the thing in such way that instead of A being against the canonical blob something else was So, so you could set a little notch that held it in position, but in a place that actually was not
 the standard position. If you put your button - your ring-setting
 button - against the letter B it had the effect of making A map across
 to what B would normally have turned into. B would 
 normally have turned into K. B goes to M; C goes to F; D goes to L and so on. It's just an offsetting mechanism. It's just moving, as it were, the bunch of
 wires inside the rotor. So, that is what a 'ring setting' is. It's basically an initial offset, that
 changes the mapping ever so subtly - makes things even more complicated. The  final
 bit of complication now, just so that we're completely mind-blown and think: ""How on earth could this ever be decrypted
 by anybody?"" You might think that just as a car's odometer would go all the way up to 9, on the
 right-hand side and the moment it turns over at 9 it would nudge the
 next one on the left, some bright spark had the idea that it might give more security if you made different wheel types have
 different turnover points. And Doenitz's extra rotors VI, VII and VIII - even worse - they turn over twice! Once at Z, and once at M - in the middle of
 the alphabet. Actually it's not a good idea if you
 think about it. And I'll tell you why. Imagine you know - because you've done a lot of work on this - you're pretty
 sure that at the moment the machine has got a Type I rotor at the right. And you're also pretty sure from the
 cryptanalytical working done, that it's currently on the letter N. You then type in three more of the received ciphertext letters.  And you
 suddenly see -  you suddenly find things going completely weird.
 This isn't just the same wheel turning, something's happening, It shouldn't have come out looking like this - 
 this sequence! Argh!  it's turned over the middle rotor, so if I
 think it was on N and it's turned over the middle rotor on a Q, then it follows that that right-hand
 rotor must be of Type I and I wanted to know that all along. So
 these turnover points, because they weren't all at Z to A, which would have
 made it all look uniform, you know, whenever anything turns over
 that's the way it does it, had this little signature that if you're very
 careful in your cryptanalysis gives the game away. How is this all gathered together? If you were very lucky, in the very early days
 of the war, you didn't even have to try and cryptanalyse
 this incoming ciphertext traffic - either by hand or by machine. If you
 could do what Bletchley Park called 'a pinch', If you could actually get a secret agent
 or an army officer to just accidentally be able to get hold
 of the code tables, issued to the German armed forces, you
 didn't have to do any cryptanalysis at all either by hand or by using this very
 expensive machinery that we'll be talking about next time, this electro-mecanical Bombe. You didn't have 
 to use those it's all here. But as James makes very clear in his videos If you did get that bit of luck it never
 lasted long; you maybe got a month's worth and then a
 it ran out, or someone back at headquarters said: ""I'm not happy, 
 one of our code books seems to have been stolen and disappeared. I'll tell you what, even though there's six 
 months to go on it, we're throwning it away and issuing another one - just to be on the safe side"". 
 We've assumed and it's quite right that the good thing about Enigma
 from the cryptanalysis point of view it started off life as a commercially available 
 totally open machine so you might think: ""Well the wiring inside those
 rotors then - three of the rotors at least, I, II and III -
 would be known?"" Yes, but of course the moment the Luftwaffe and 
 the Army started introducing two more rotors you've then got
 the problem of ""Can we steal these things or do we
 have to work out from first principles, and with rather a lot of advanced Group
 Theory and mathematics, and a lot of known ciphertext and plaintext, and all sorts - 
 can we work out what the wiring is in those rotors without actually having
 them?"" And the answer is, eventually, ""Yes"", but it's very very nice if somebody helps you on this front.
 What did you need to know in order to decrypt a cipher stream done within Enigma, that your listening
 stations had picked up ?. It was transmitted in Morse as single letters sent to Bletchley Park - what do you need to
 know to make any sense of this? Number 1:  which rotor wheels are in use? Number 2: what is the ordering, left to right, of those rotor wheels ?
 Number 3: for each of those rotor wheels where has
 that stud been located that does the ring setting - against which letter ? 
 The fourth thing, which  we haven't mentioned very much, but which
 in the next video we'll say a lot about the operator himself - usually himself
 not herself -  had to also do what was called a 
 'message setting'. for this particular message. Every separate message had to have a different
 message setting. It wouldn't have been safe just to keep
 using the ring settings alone without any alteration to those. So
 that had to be worked out as well. And finally - last but not least - the plug
 board cross-connections had to be worked out. Now that's a lot of stuff. In the very
 early days of simple Enigma, where therw were only three rotors, not
 chosen from anything else, just three, we'll find out next time that
 the Polish Cipher Bureau had a lot of success by hand, and with a very simple machine, in getting things decrypted. But the
 moment you start adding more rotors, plugboard and all the complications you
 rapidly find the you just don't have enough time in
 the day to decrypt all that you'd like to do. The sheer weight of cipher traffic takes over. You have to mechanise."
moonlanding,"On November 15, 1988, the world learned that the Soviet Union also had their own space shuttle. It had been secretly under development for well over a decade and it had cost the Soviets billions to build it. Several of the spacecraft were in various stages of construction. But the Soviet shuttle, named the Buran, would only ever launch once. Its development had largely been driven by the need to respond to the perceived military potential of the NASA Space Shuttle.

When the Buran was first launched, the world speculated that it would be used to build Soviet space stations or even assemble spacecraft for a manned mars mission. But as the Soviet Union began to collapse, funding for the Buran program was limited and eventually eliminated.

There’s no denying that the Buran looks very similar to the Space Shuttle. But in many ways, the Buran was quite different from the NASA Space Shuttle. The Buran orbiter didn’t have integrated main engines. Almost all of its lifting power was provided by a separate super-heavy rocket called Energia, which consisted of a core stage and 4 liquid-fueled boosters. Unlike the Space shuttle, which was a single system, the Buran orbiter, and its lifting rockets were actually two separate systems.
 
While the Shuttle, with its integrated engines, was more reusable, in practice, it required intensive maintenance between launches, which offset a lot of this advantage.  But once in space, the Space Shuttle’s integrated engines no longer served a purpose. So, for most of the Shuttle’s mission, it was forced to haul around thousands of pounds of dead weight. Without integrated engines, the Buran could carry slightly more payload than the American Space Shuttle. But the Energia rocket could launch by itself, without the Buran attached. That meant it could carry external payloads into space, and could launch an astounding 100 tons. From the outset, the Buran was also capable of fully automated flight, meaning it could be launched, put into orbit and returned back to earth without any crew on board. 

In the final days of the Soviet Union, when it was clear that the American shuttle had no meaningful military potential, the Soviet military no longer wanted anything to do with the Buran. The Soviet space community was left with a spacecraft that was expensive, complex, and largely without a real purpose. #Buran #SpaceRace #Spaceships  #SovietSpaceProgram

 before it, it was the first reusable spacecraft and it promised to make
 travel into space affordable, safe, almost routine. And so by the 1970's America
 abandoned expendable rockets, which could only be used once, and went all in on
 space shuttles, Building the Columbia, the Challenger, the discovery, the Atlantis
 the Braun and the Endeavour. Wait a minute, this is not one of the space
 shuttles. In 1988, the world learned that the
 Soviet Union also had a space shuttle. They had been secretly developing it for
 well over a decade, and it had cost them billions. But maybe you've never heard of
 it, and that wouldn't be too surprising, because the Soviet Space Shuttle only
 ever launched once. But it's not because it was flawed. Actually its first launch
 was a huge success and in a lot of ways it was actually more capable and robust
 than the American space shuttle. But after its first launch, the Soviet
 shuttle seems to have just disappeared. And to understand why, you need to go
 back to the late 1960's. That's when the Soviets would have learned that the
 Americans were planning to replace their conventional rockets with a new reusable
 spacecraft. But at first the Soviets wouldn't have been concerned. After all,
 they had done their own research into reusable spacecraft and space planes. And the Soviets were pretty busy with other space projects. They were still in the
 race to put a man on the moon, they had ambitious plans for a space station, even
 a potential moon base. But by 1975 the mood had changed, the Soviets had grown paranoid that the American space shuttle might also be used as a space weapon.
 Soviet research institutes studied the shuttle program and what they found was
 that the publicly stated goals of the program, well, just didn't line up with what the Americans were actually building. For one, the shuttle promised to make getting into space cheaper. But the Soviets could
 clearly see that the shuttle's launch costs were actually going to be higher
 than the Rockets it was supposed to replace.  And the shuttle program promised an incredible 60 launches a year, giving the Americans the ability to get a lot
 of material into orbit - ten times more than they had been previously able to.
 And yet there was nothing in NASA's plans that called for so many launches.
 The space shuttle'ss commercial and scientific goals were starting to look
 like a smokescreen for what was likely a military program. The Soviets suspected
 that the shuttle could be used to launch something like, say, a laser weapon into
 orbit, test it, then bring it back down to earth for further development.
 With a shuttle type craft, the Americans could militarize space a lot quicker
 than the Soviets. The shuttle could even be used to capture a Soviet spy
 satellite and bring it back down to earth for study. And to compound Soviet
 fears, they discovered that the Americans were quietly building a second launch
 site for the shuttle at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. And here's the
 thing with Vandenberg, launch the shuttle from there and by its first orbit it's
 over all the major population centers of the Soviet Union. So the shuttle could in
 theory deliver a nuclear first-strike faster than any Soviet nuclear delivery
 system. The Soviet military pushed hard for the Soviet Union
 to start developing its own space shuttle, but few involved in the Soviet
 space program actually wanted a shuttle type craft. But four years after the
 Americans began working on the space shuttle, the Kremlin quietly gave the go-ahead to start developing a Soviet counterpart
 The Soviet Union's space shuttle would be called Buran and its research and
 development would be kept a closely guarded secret for years. When the
 Americans first launched the Space Shuttle on April 12 1981, which awkwardly enough was the 20th anniversary of the Soviets launching the first man into
 space, the Soviet media was scathing. They blasted the Americans for putting in
 military craft into space and they reminded viewers that the Soviet Union's
 space program was for the betterment of science and humanity. Very few Soviet citizens would have known that their own government was
 secretly developing a similar shuttle. There's no way around it the Buran
 looked a lot like the American Space Shuttle, and it's got nothing to do with
 aerodynamic or thermodynamic laws. The goal had been to build something that
 could match the military potential of the Space Shuttle and with a lot of
 information about the American Space Shuttle freely available and
 unclassified, it's not hard to imagine what happened next. But here's the thing,
 the Soviets already knew a thing or two about getting into space, so they didn't
 just copy the shuttle, they might have designed a better Space Shuttle
 First there's a big difference in how the Space Shuttle and the Buran actually
 get into space. The Space Shuttle's orbiter uses integrated reusable main
 engines which are fueled by an external tank. But because the main engines were
 not powerful enough to put the Shuttle into orbit, it also needed the help of
 two expendable solid rocket boosters. But the Buran didn't have integrated engines,
 all of its lifting power was provided by a separate super-heavy rocket called
 Energia. It consisted of a core stage and four
 boosters. Unlike the Space Shuttle, which was a single system,  the Buran orbiter
 and it's lifting Rockets were actually two separate systems. While the Shuttle
 with its integrated engines was more reusable, in practice it required
 intensive maintenance between launches, which offset a lot of its advantage, but
 once in space the Shuttle's integrated engines no
 longer serve the purpose. So for most of the Shuttle's mission, it was forced to
 haul around thousands of pounds of dead weight. This meant that the Buran
 could carry slightly more payload than the Space Shuttle, but more importantly
 the Soviet system had a massive advantage: flexibility. The Energia
 rocket could launch by itself without the Buran attached, and that meant it
 could carry other things into space. Without the Buran, the Energia rocket could launch an astounding 100 tons. That's three Space Shuttles worth of
 lifting power. The Space Shuttle's first stage uses solid rocket boosters. The
 Energia's are liquid fueled. The thing with solid rocket boosters is, once they're
 started, there's simply no way to shut them off. The Energia's liquid-fueled
 rockets could be throttled up down or even shut off completely in an emergency. And in an emergency, the Buran had ejection seats for the entire crew, which
 could function while on the launch pad or all the way up to 20 miles.
 Only the first two shuttles had ejection seats and only for two crew members.
 Later shuttles had no ejection seats at all. From the outset the Buran was also
 capable of fully automated flight, meaning it could be launched, put into
 orbit, and returned back to earth without any crew on board. Automated flight couldhave been used for rescue missions and an empty Buran could be sent up to
 rescue the crew of a space station or another stranded orbiter. The Buran's
 first launch was on November of 1988. The western media was impressed. Especially by it's fully automatic landing system. On that autumn day in 1988 the future of Soviet space flight - at least from an outsider's perspective - looked promising. The media speculated that the Buran would be used to build space stations, or
 maybe to assemble a spacecraft for a manned mission to Mars. Of course none of that ever happened the Buran was only launched once. In the late 1980's the
 Soviet Union began to collapse, and with it funding for the Buran was limited, and
 eventually cut off entirely. Tough questions started rolling in about the
 program. Soviet engineers had done a fine job, but the entire program was starting
 to look absurdly expensive. Like the American Space Shuttle, the Buran was
 costly and inefficient, but unlike the Americans the Russians still had other
 ways to get into space. A soyuz rocket could launch payload into orbit six
 times cheaper than a Braun. But if the Soviet Union hadn't collapsed, well, we
 might imagine Burans being used to assemble orbital space stations, or
 spacecraft for missions to other planets. Or maybe not. The Soviets had been so
 paranoid about the military potential of the American Shuttle they wanted their
 own matching system.  But that goal quickly became pretty much the only goal. In the final days of the Soviet Union, when it was clear that the American
 shuttle had no meaningful military potential, the Soviet military no longer
 wanted anything to do with the Buran, and the Soviet space community was left with
 a spacecraft that was expensive, complex, and largely without a real purpose"
moonlanding,"Did Mars long ago develop far enough for life to arise? If so, does anything still live within Mars' dusty plains, beneath its ice caps, or somewhere underground? 

In 1964 the Mariner Four spacecraft flew by Mars and got a good look. What it saw looked more like the Moon than the Earth. Then, in the mid-1970's, two lander-orbiter robot teams, named Viking, went in for an even closer look. The landers tested the soil for the chemical residues of life. All the evidence from Viking told us: Mars is dead. And extremely harsh.

The mission recorded Martian surface temperatures from -17 degrees Celsius down to -107. We now know it can get even colder than that at the poles. The atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, with only traces of oxygen. And it's extremely thin, with less than one percent the surface pressure of Earth's atmosphere.

And it's bone dry. In fact, the Sahara Desert is a rainforest compared to Mars, where water vapor is a trace gas in the atmosphere. On Earth, impact craters erode over time from wind and water... and even volcanic activity. On Mars, they can linger for billions of years. 

Earth's surface is shaped and reshaped by the horizontal movement of plates that make up its crust driven by heat welling up from the planet's hot interior. At half the width and only 11% the mass of Earth, Mars doesn't generate enough heat to support wide-scale plate tectonics. 

Nor does it have the gravity to hold a thick atmosphere needed to store enough heat at the surface to allow liquid water to flow. Nonetheless, some areas that looked to Viking-era scientists like craters and volcanic areas, were later shown to be riverbeds, lake bottoms, and ocean shorelines. 

If water once flowed on Mars' surface, where did it all go?

This was the scene at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in 2004. The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity had just bounced down on the Red Planet. When the excitement died down, the rovers were set off on one of the most remarkable journeys in the history of planetary exploration. Missions like this could one day pave the way for a day when we'll view images from a real astronaut's camera.

Opportunity had come to rest in a small crater near the equator, at a spot called Meridiani Planum. Here, in plain view, on a nearby crater wall, its camera revealed exposed bedrock, the first ever seen on Mars. Not far away, the rover found layered rocks on the face of a cliff. On Earth, they typically form as sedimentary layers at the bottom of oceans. 

And at every turn, Opportunity rolled across tiny, smooth, round pellets. They became known as ""blueberries"" because they appeared purplish-brown against Mars' rust-colored surface.  Initially thought to be volcanic in origin, they turned out to be iron-rich spherules of the type that form within cavities in the mud at the bottom of an ocean. 

Drilling into rocks, the rover inserted a spectrometer to read the mineral content. The readings showed significant amounts of sulfate salt, a tracer for standing water. That wasn't all. Spirit's broken wheel, dragging behind it, exposed soils saturated in salt. 

Clearly there once was water on Mars' surface, but how long ago?  And, if there is anything left, where would you find it? One possible answer: the North Pole.  From orbit, this region seemed to be covered in frozen CO2 - what we call dry ice. But was there water ice below the surface?

Enter Phoenix, a lander that touched down near the North Pole in early 2008. Radar readings from orbit, taken by the Mars Express mission, hinted at the presence of ice just below the surface.

The Phoenix lander's descent thrusters blew away the top layer of soil, allowing its camera to snap pictures of what looked like ice. Scientists instructed the robot to conduct a simple experiment: reach out and dig a trench, then watch what happens.

As expected, clumps of white stuff appeared. A couple of days later, it was gone. Vaporized. That means it can't be salt or frozen CO2, which is stable in the cold dry temperatures of the Martian pole. So it had to be water, the first ever directly seen on Mars.

There are indications that the North Pole was actually warm enough in the recent past for water ice to become liquid. The Mars Reconaissance Orbiter, or MRO, used radar pulses to peer beneath the surface of the ice cap. These data reveal that the ice, just over a mile thick, formed in a succession of layers as the climate alternated between warm and cold. 

Our planet avoids mood swings like this in part because its spin is stabilized by a massive moon. Mars' spin is not, so it can really wobble, with the pole tilting toward the sun for long periods. New observations by the MRO spacecraft show that these wobbles can lead to dramatic releases of CO2, and warming periods due to an increase in the greenhouse effect.",Cosmic Journeys - Mars: Earth that Never Was,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgMXPXdqJn8,0,1649191,8117,398,1801,JgMXPXdqJn8,"There is a region on Mars, roughly the size
 of Australia, that rises high above the surface of the planet. Three of the largest volcanoes
 in the solar system line up to guard its western flank. To the East, a vast canyon, six to seven times
 deeper than the Grand Canyon, cuts into the barren Martian plain. This strange region,
 once so baffling to scientists, recalls the planet's violent past, a time long ago when
 the planet's core erupted, pushing molten rock to the surface. It's part of a larger story, a planetary tragedy,
 in which Mars began its descent into the cold, dry, and lifeless state that we see today.
 We are now scouring its surprisingly complex surface for clues to the events that long
 ago doomed the Red Planet, Mars. Since the early 1960s, we've tried 46 times
 to send spacecraft to Mars across the 55 million kilometers of its closest approach to Earth. Over half failed at launch or upon arrival.
 The rest flew around the planet, snapping pictures, recording data. Or they landed to
 test its soil and rocks, and crawl around its canyons and craters. These probes may one day pave the way for
 human explorers, who will dig deeper still, in search of answers to our most pressing
 question: Did Mars, at some point long ago develop far
 enough for life to arise? If so, does anything still live within Mars' dusty plains, beneath
 its ice caps, or somewhere underground? Mars does not give up its secrets easily.
 Over the years, that has led observers on this planet to jump to all sorts of conclusions. In the year 1877, the Italian astronomer Giovanni
 Schiaparelli noted markings on Mars' surface, a latticework of lines. He called them ""canali""
 in Italian, meaning ""channels"" in English. A careful and thorough observer, Schiaparelli
 began to sketch them and name them, connecting them in a vast global network. Over a 15-year period, beginning in 1894,
 the American astronomer, Percival Lowell, closely examined these features. He saw a
 remarkable drama unfolding on our neighboring planet. In his view, Schiaparelli's channels were
 artificial canals, designed perhaps to carry melting snow from the poles to the dry interior.
 After all, on Earth, the Suez Canal had been open since 1869. Construction on the Panama
 Canal had just gotten underway. The Martian canals, Lowell surmised, had been
 built by a sophisticated society confronting an environmental catastrophe on the grandest
 of scales. Its inhabitants faced an urgent choice: move water across vast arid regions,
 or perish on an increasingly dry planet. In a series of three best-selling books, Lowell
 took his case to the public. The public responded with some ideas of their own. With the means to remake an entire planet,
 perhaps these Martians were more advanced than humans. Some of us began offering schemes
 for making contact. Giant mirrors to flash greetings. Light beams. Mental telepathy. Lowell vision fell by the wayside in 1964.
 The Mariner Four spacecraft flew by Mars and got a good look. What it saw looked more like
 the Moon than the Earth. Three more Mariners followed, culminating in the arrival of Mariner
 Nine in 1971, the first spacecraft to go into orbit around Mars. These missions documented a heavily cratered
 landscape, pocked with huge dormant volcanoes... and cut with the deepest and longest canyon
 in the solar system. They saw no traces of life, present or past. Then, in the mid-1970's, two lander-orbiter
 robot teams, named Viking, went in for an even closer look. The landers tested the soil
 for the chemical residues of life. All the evidence from Viking told us: Mars is dead.
 And extremely harsh. The mission recorded Martian surface temperatures
 from -17 degrees Celsius down to -107. We now know it can get even colder than that
 at the poles. The atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, with only traces of oxygen. And it's
 extremely thin, with less than one percent the surface pressure of Earth's atmosphere. And it's bone dry. In fact, the Sahara Desert
 is a rainforest compared to Mars, where water vapor is a trace gas in the atmosphere. On
 Earth, impact craters erode over time from wind and water... and even volcanic activity.
 On Mars, they can linger for billions of years. Earth's surface is shaped and reshaped by
 the horizontal movement of plates that make up its crust driven by heat welling up from
 the planet's hot interior. At half the width and only 11% the mass of Earth, Mars doesn't
 generate enough heat to support wide-scale plate tectonics. Nor does it have the gravity to hold a thick
 atmosphere needed to store enough heat at the surface to allow liquid water to flow.
 Nonetheless, some areas that looked to Viking-era scientists like craters and volcanic areas,
 were later shown to be riverbeds, lake bottoms, and ocean shorelines. If water once flowed on Mars' surface, where
 did it all go? This was the scene at NASA's Jet Propulsion
 Lab in 2004. The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity had just bounced down on the Red Planet. When
 the excitement died down, the rovers were set off on one of the most remarkable journeys
 in the history of planetary exploration. Opportunity had come to rest in a small crater
 near the equator, at a spot called Meridiani Planum. Here, in plain view, on a nearby crater
 wall, its camera revealed exposed bedrock, the first ever seen on Mars. Not far away,
 the rover found layered rocks on the face of a cliff. On Earth, they typically form
 as sedimentary layers at the bottom of oceans. And at every turn, Opportunity rolled across
 tiny, smooth, round pellets. They became known as ""blueberries"" because they appeared purplish-brown
 against Mars' rust-colored surface. Initially thought to be volcanic in origin, they turned
 out to be iron-rich spherules of the type that form within cavities in the mud at the
 bottom of an ocean. Drilling into rocks, the rover inserted a
 spectrometer to read the mineral content. The readings showed significant amounts of
 sulfate salt, a tracer for standing water. That wasn't all. Spirit's broken wheel, dragging
 behind it, exposed soils saturated in salt. Clearly there once was water on Mars' surface,
 but how long ago? And, if there is anything left, where would you find it? One possible
 answer: the North Pole. From orbit, this region seemed to be covered in frozen CO2 - what
 we call dry ice. But was there water ice below the surface? Enter Phoenix, a lander that touched down
 near the North Pole in early 2008. Radar readings from orbit, taken by the Mars Express mission,
 hinted at the presence of ice just below the surface. The Phoenix lander's descent thrusters blew
 away the top layer of soil, allowing its camera to snap pictures of what looked like ice.
 Scientists instructed the robot to conduct a simple experiment: reach out and dig a trench,
 then watch what happens. As expected, clumps of white stuff appeared.
 A couple of days later, it was gone. Vaporized. That means it can't be salt or frozen CO2,
 which is stable in the cold dry temperatures of the Martian pole. So it had to be water,
 the first ever directly seen on Mars. There are indications that the North Pole
 was actually warm enough in the recent past for water ice to become liquid. The Mars Reconaissance
 Orbiter, or MRO, used radar pulses to peer beneath the surface of the ice cap. These
 data reveal that the ice, just over a mile thick, formed in a succession of layers as
 the climate alternated between warm and cold. Our planet avoids mood swings like this in
 part because its spin is stabilized by a massive moon. Mars' spin is not, so it can really
 wobble, with the pole tilting toward the sun for long periods. New observations by the
 MRO spacecraft show that these wobbles can lead to dramatic releases of CO2, and warming
 periods due to an increase in the greenhouse effect. The ice now detected below Mar's surface is
 a remnant of a much earlier time. The thinking is that not long after its birth, the planet's
 molten interior would have spewed out enough gas to form an atmosphere. Carbon dioxide and water vapor began to trap
 heat from sunlight.  Temperatures rose high enough to allow liquid
 water to flow on the surface, creating myriad rivers, ponds, lakes and oceans. Evidence of this thicker atmosphere landed,
 literally, in Opportunity's backyard. The rover spied a strange bluish rock, a nickel
 iron meteorite named Block Island. Streaking through a thin atmosphere, this massive chunk
 of metal should have been obliterated on contact. Instead, its fall was likely slowed, and its
 impact softened, by a much thicker atmosphere. What then caused the atmosphere, and the water,
 to disappear, and the planet to grow cold and dry? The answer comes from data recorded
 by the Mars Global Surveyor just after it went into orbit in 1997. Its instruments detected the presence of a
 weak magnetic field emanating from the planet, a reading that scientists eagerly compared
 to that of Earth. Our planet's magnetic field is generated by molten rock deep in its core
 that rises and falls into a vast region below the outer crust, called the mantle. It has turned Earth into an electric dynamo.
 The rising and sinking motion within, combined with the spinning motion of the planet, generates
 a strong magnetic field. You can trace this field back to Earth's early years, when large
 amounts of heavy elements such as iron sank into its core. Radioactive decay began to
 generate heat and the planet's mass is large enough to hold it in. Earth's magnetic field extends far enough
 out into space to deflect the wind of high-energy solar particles. Without a similar electromagnetic
 ""deflector shield"" on Mars, solar radiation lashed the planet, gradually stripping it
 of its atmosphere. What water Mars had would have vaporized into space or frozen underground. However, there is evidence that at one time
 Mars did have a robust magnetic field. Rocks in some of the older craters bear a strong
 imprint of this field, while newer craters indicate a much weaker field. What happened to it? The answer lies deep
 in Mars' past, in events so powerful they are still written on the landscape. 
 This is a simple elevation map of Mars' surface, from data gathered by the Mars Odyssey spacecraft.
 The South Pole, colored in red and orange, is piled high with ice. Moving off these southern highlands, we make
 our way north. The landscape is pocked with craters. The largest and oldest ones have
 faded, their edges softened by windblown dust. Moving up along the equator, we pass into
 a region called Tharsis, based on a biblical name for the western edge of the known world. On the edge of this vast high altitude plateau
 is a series of enormous volcanoes: Ascraeus Mons: 18 kilometers high. Pavonis Mons: 14
 kilometers. Arsia Mons: 16 kilometers. Just beyond, is the largest volcano in our solar
 system, Olympus Mons, 25 kilometers in elevation. The thinking is that the Tharsis region bulged
 out when a giant dome of magma pushed up from the planet's core. The volcanoes grew large
 because Mars lacks the constant shifting of crustal plates that, on Earth, leads to chains
 of smaller volcanoes like the Hawaiian Islands. Just to the East is the great Valles Marineris
 - named for the Mariner Nine mission that found this vast gash in the Martian landscape.
 It's about 4000 kilometers long and up to 200 kilometers wide. On Earth, Valles Marineris
 would stretch from Los Angeles all the way to the Atlantic coast. If you went to Valles Marineris, you'd see
 dust devils sweeping along the plains above it and dust blowing up the canyon walls. Here's
 a realistic rendering of data captured by spacecraft. Giant landslides have caused the
 walls to slump off and pile onto the valley floor. Feeding into the valley: a maze of side channels.
 Scientists think these and other tributary features were formed when underground water
 flowed into the main basin, and the land above collapsed. Wider parts of the canyon are regarded
 as possible landing sites for a manned mission. They offer flat surfaces and possible access
 to liquid water that may remain below the surface. The theory is that Valles Marineris formed
 when the planet began to cool. Its sides were pulled apart as the Tharsis plateau, just
 to the west, began to rise up. That chain of events is now being linked to a much larger
 planetary event, what one scientist called ""the"" defining moment in Mars' history. Travel north, down the slopes of Mars's great
 volcanoes. The elevation drops as we move across what appears to be an immense ocean,
 colored here in blue. With this so-called Borealis Basin in the north, and the high
 elevations of the South, Mars is a lopsided planet. In fact, there is a difference of
 about 30 kilometers in the thickness of the crust in these two regions. Here's the reason: Early on, when the Solar System was young,
 Mars was hit by at least 15 large asteroids. Scientists have linked these events to a time
 around 3.9 billion years ago, known as the late heavy bombardment, when rock samples
 from the Apollo landings show that our own moon was seriously pummeled. One theory holds that these impacts heated
 the outer subsurface layer of the planet, Mars' ""mantle."" That prevented molten rock
 in its core from rising up... and caused the crust to thicken. This had the effect of shutting
 off Mars' magnetic field, exposing the planet to damaging solar winds, and over time, turning
 it into a wasteland. One model says that as the newly formed giant
 gas planets, Jupiter and Saturn, moved in their orbits, they hurled a rain of asteroids
 and comets at the inner solar system. There are other theories that explain the disappearance
 of Mars magnetic field and its atmosphere. What's certain is that at some point early
 in its history, the Red Planet grew increasingly desolate. The Martian landscape we see today is replete
 with coded signals from those early times, ancient riverbeds and lake bottoms, flood
 plains, and volcanic cones, as well as the battering it received from impacts. But is Mars a dead world? Maybe. Maybe not.
 An infrared telescope on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano was trained on Mars over several years.
 Astronomers used a spectrometer to split the light into its individual wavelengths... to
 identify chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere. They found the signature of methane gas, in
 amounts that change from place to place. Because methane should disappear quickly in Mars'
 atmosphere, there must be some source that constantly replenishes it. That source could amount to nothing more than
 the chemical reactions in Mars' crust. Or it could be biological in nature, perhaps
 microbes alive and well in heated pools underground. So far, neither the satellites flying over
 Mars, nor the robots on the ground, have turned up anything close to clear proof of life.
 It may take the searching eyes, flexible minds, and nimble fingers of human explorers to find
 that buried treasure, if it exists. In the meantime, we are finding that even
 if Mars is dead, it's certainly not dull. Mars has nowhere near the dynamism of Earth,
 with its oceans, atmosphere, volcanism, and shifting continents. But it does do some fascinating
 things: If you take an atmosphere, however tenuous,
 add heat from the sun. You get the renowned dust devils of Mars. With no trees to hold
 the soil down, landslides are common. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has returned
 images showing that Mars is actively remaking its surface, not in canals built by the Martian
 engineers of Percival Lowell's imagination, but in sand dunes shaped by the wind, and
 in landscapes molded by a gradually changing climate. Some scientists have even turned
 up hints of low-level plate tectonics. Whether or not we ever find life-forms on
 Mars, we can still marvel at the beauty of our neighboring planet, its surface subtly
 sculpted over eons of time, on a world that never was. 7"

this engineering marvel came to be as an amazing story that begins in the early 1970s the yet Nam war is divisive and costly the economy is sliding into recession and with the race to the moon already won the Apollo program is cancelled a new mission is sought for NASA to send humans into space but Mars for many the next logical step on the path of exploration is dismissed as too costly a destination for a country preoccupied with events back on earth instead on January 5th 1972 another destination is selected low-earth orbit as early as the mid 1960s NASA had concluded that the technology was available to build and fly a reusable spacecraft President Nixon really liked the idea and told the NASA Administrator go do it and the NASA Administrator got a call from OMB the next morning someone there and said hey what the president really meant to say was you're gonna get this much money and so do as best you can with the space transportation system and our choice logically was we have to have a vehicle first and so that that was the birth of the Space Shuttle as the first in the three-part space transportation system many designs were considered often they combined the best features of different concepts at that time they were looking at having jet engines on the shuttle for landing and for transporting it across the country the idea of the lifting bodies was to bring ass home conventional runway and previously all of our thick paths which were capital and down in the ocean someone came up with the idea of a vehicle that could land like an airplane the key thing was to understand aerodynamic stability across the hypersonic supersonic subsonic and landing speed type of environments that a single vehicle has to fly safely that was a key thing that was learned from those and you'll see it reflected in the shape of the space shuttle one was the use of a lifting body an aircraft with no conventional wings only its fuselage would keep the aircraft airborne and guided safely back to earth they were known as a flying bathtub for the first half the m2 f1 was towed behind a car souped up potty act whitey Whiteside drove that Pontiac across the light that at about 120 miles per hour dragging us flying bathtub behind it as well as ground breaking their tests could also prove ground shake the x24 be a lifting body with wings was the first such craft to land on an actual runway as all shuttles would eventually do early on the space shuttle was going to have jet engines to return for horizontal landing much like an airliner the x-15 had proven fairly specifically that they can make horizontal landings very accurately unpowered flying a steep glide slope that they could do a horizontal unpowered landing with the shuttle as they tried to narrow its size shape and weight engineers also considered how this new orbiter would be propelled safely out of the reach of Earth's gravity at the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville home of the rockets that had sent every Mercury Gemini and Apollo astronaut into space design teams would devise the partially reusable propulsion system that would finally be about the main engines were always something we paid very close attention to lots of moving parts lots of lots of high-energy and very tight places and very cold liquid open one side of a very small wall and very hot on the other side and that thing finally that off for me it just showed the power of a space shuttle main engine in and then there's three on the back of an orbiter and then there's the two solid rocket motors that was probably the spark that got me so interested in the space shuttle program in general and what it took to actually get one engine to light much less three and two boosters to take the shuttle to orbit as for the orbiter spiraling costs forced NASA to abandon equipping it with its own jet engines and escape pod originally it was going to be an air-breathing airplane that would fly to space as a rocket and then come back to earth the orbital maneuvering system pods that sit on the back now we're to be where deployable air breathing engines would come out and it would be able to fly from its intended point of landing to another place if the weather were bad or something like that NASA's new shuttle would essentially glide its way back to earth producing the components of this new space transportation system fell to familiar names in the space industry prime contractor Rockwell North American now Boeing had built the Apollo command/service module Morton Thiokol now ATK would build the solid rocket boosters and martin marietta now Lockheed Martin would construct the et responsibility for producing the space shuttles main engines went to Rocketdyne now Pratt Whitney there's a lot of teamwork that was going on it was bringing people from all across the country from Kennedy from Johnson from Marshall so many people involved that had to have work together know at the beginning there was a lot of anxiety that we weren't going to work together but when people got to know each other and could trust each other that's when the work became it was an amazing vehicle and a lot of ways way ahead of its time to have a reusable spacecraft they could carry such tremendous amounts of cargo to space was unprecedented September 1976 more than four-and-a-half years after President Nixon signed off on its development America's new spacecraft Constitution gets its first close up before the cameras the orbiter itself is well received by the public but impassioned fans of a particular long cancelled television series called Star Trek wanted it called something else they staged a successful write-in campaign and the orbiter was renamed for the starship featured on the show thus NASA's new shuttle would be the enterprise boldly going as no spacecraft had ever gone before whatever its name this bird still needed to prove he could fly in an age before computer simulations balsa wood models and Windtunnel testing was the only means to test the airliner sized glider we put together a very aggressive flight test profile that consisted of data points continuously all the way down they were just not there was not a matter of ten seconds went by without another either a pitch doublet or a rudder kick or an angle of attack sweep the things that really turn on a test pilot to fly them as accurately as possible August 12th 1977 on a crystal-clear California morning high above the Mojave Desert to NASA test pilots ready for enterprises first flight the plan was for Fred Hayes jr. and Gordon Fullerton to lift the orbiter off a modified 747 then land on a dry lakebed 15,000 feet below the thing that we were most concerned about was if we were going to be able to get to a launch speed if Fitz Fulton was going to be able to put the 747 into a slight dive so that we would have enough lift on the enterprise to when he did push the separation button blow the bolts to lift away from the airplane without hidden fits his tail and of course both of us were interested in the pilots on the 747 Fitz Fulton and Tom mcmerkin sit and wait for the command to release and steer their massive aircraft out from under enterprise there were still questions about whether they gonna actually happen as we from those simulations and the analysis and everything there's a very loud thump when the shuttle separates there was always a question was coming on slide back hit the tail at 747 but we couldn't see that but we could after a few seconds we could tell it didn't hit us and so the chase called clear once we reached the 240 knots and Fitz called on speed I think he really pushed some of the sensors he was looking at in order to let us get to there but and we appreciated that but once once we heard fit say on speed I pushed the separation button and we we just broke free we had about one and a half G's of lift honestly that was probably the most exciting moment in the approach and landing test to feel and be there when the shuttle separated from the platform ever file accounts this first freefall test is a success five weeks later Enterprise is brought to twenty two thousand for her second freefall test pilots Joe Engel and dick truly have only two minutes to capture flight and maneuvering data before landing the aircraft again without any engine it was a real team effort the challenge was for dick truly and I to fly that profile and fly those data points those maneuvers as precisely as possible to give them the best data possible it was it was a test pilot ream a total of 16 taxi captive and drop tests confirm the sounds of the crafts design and green-lighted production of the first space worthy for Columbia NASA's first orbiter is fittingly named after the first American vessel to circumnavigate the however Columbia quickly becomes a daunting challenge for NASA it's complex makeup had engineers struggling constantly to reduce Columbia's weight and simplify construction especially frustrating was keeping the orbiters ceramic tiles attached to its fuselage more than $25,000 fit together to protect Columbia from the searing 3,000 degree heat of reentry we were having a lot of problems with the thermal protection system of the tiles the way we were trying to glue a moment with this wouldn't stay off and we had to come up with a way of making sure that they'd stay on and we had some really great people that work that and that's why it took such a long time I had hoped it was not going to take that long since so John and I were named as a crew so we had a lot more time to Train than what I had we'd both initially planned the requirement was to be able to handle temperatures like 2500 degrees have to occur on the surface of the the TPS and that's five times what your oven is at the home that you bake cookies under at max the other problem is weight because after all this is an airplane so you can't have a metallic system on it that weighs tons it has to be extremely lightweight and in fact the shuttle tiles are about 90% air and that gives the combination of being able to be temperature resistant and yet at the same time light each orbiter has a unique number of protective tiles Challenger was built with the most 30 1088 while Atlantis has the fewest a mere 24,000 177 over in Palmdale they had put on their first effort of putting the tiles on to protect the aluminum from the heating then we're going to get on reentry and some of those tiles would they put them on in the daytime next morning the tiles were on the hangar floor and so that was real scary that they we could lose some tiles whether they're on orbit and really have a problem with the heat coming back on reentry Columbia had a lot of tiles missing yet needed quite a bit of work before we could deliver it to the Cape and we scrounged throughout the city of Lancaster for rkv which was the the material we use to glue the tiles on with more glue did keep the tiles in place however water was literally ripping them apart it turns out an instant we hit rained the tiles who almost exploded the tiles fabrication process was modified and the problem overcome other shuttle design features proved less problematic and more groundbreaking a computerized digital flight control system now common in commercial and military aircraft was developed for the orbiter in flying the space shuttle you were so aware that you aren't necessarily talking to the shuttle you're talking to a computer who in turn was going to talk to the to the shuttle barriers of race and gender were falling everywhere and America's core of shuttle astronauts would become more reflective of the nation it served there's been a lot that's that the shuttle era has done to bring space flight into into the domain of the average person we know it's not just crew-cut white test pilots anymore it's it's the essentially the United Nations that flies on the space shuttles it's people of every description that look very much like the rest of us the astronaut selection process reflected a changing nation and the changing NASA at the time all the astronauts were military test pilots and there were no females so it was kind of like one of those dreams that you hope will happen someday but you didn't really think would the NASA astronaut class of 1978 the largest in the agency's history came from all walks of American life physicists meteorologists fighter pilots scientists for the first time women and african-americans when I came into the astronaut program in 78 there were three african-americans that came in at the same time and it was the first time that NASA had hired african-americans we had Fred Gregory who was a test pilot and then to Ron McNair who was a mission specialist and I came in as a mission specialist so all three of us were excited about flying in space and we all all three of us recognized that we were really going to open up the envelope for other African Americans to fly in space while the new class of NASA astronauts trained for subsequent shuttle flights Columbia was undergoing preparations for the program's maiden voyage STS 1 veteran astronaut John Young one of the 12 men to set foot on the moon is in command this pilot is first-time flyer Bob Crippen to be sitting home board and up there with my buddy John Young and get to experience the whole thing from a scent to be an on-orbit flying reentry it was with more of the high points in my career together they would travel over a million miles and circle the earth 36 times the launch finally occurred we've been waiting and postponing and postponing and when it finally lifted off and we knew it was going and achieved orbit we were wrong and anxious anticipation for what was going to happen next launched like a rocket two days earlier Columbia lands as a glider on the dry lake bed of Edwards Air Force Base in California watching out out the window watching the sea and the clouds rush by it actually gave her a sense of speed more so than then when we were up in orbit being a child I think they were all very relieved because they've been some concern because we had lost some tiles initially going on the orbit and they didn't know whether we'd lost any on the bottom or not slow down over the San Joaquin Valley we do a big turnaround to land on the lake bed that first ride I remember when John went into a bank of a big left bank I looked down to lake bed and there's thousands of people out there I think a child look at almost folks would come out to see you later Joe Engle was chased you're his voice coming in on final talking to they were right on glide slope coming in for a landing and then have that landing and then have John Young do his young dance he was just so elated it was such a magnificent flying machine to him at that time the first time I really saw a real shuttle with Columbia when it was out on a lake bed after the landing man I'm walking around it I couldn't believe they said that big a mass up in the air people really thought this was all impossible so what we do what we have done and shown and demonstrated through the shuttle program is we've shown that we can take the impossible and make it possible thousands of spectators lined up along the landing strip to greet the shuttle and it's two-man crew anyone who is associated with the program or they're just to see the shell returned I think felt a lot of pride in our country and our space program and so that those emotions were you know finally release and you said wow you know the flight was done safely they're back home the shell really does work it's a great program it's got a great future ahead of hey this thing works and we got it back all in one piece which is what we wanted to do while Columbia's return was spectacular it would renew NASA engineers worries about the shuttles thermal protection system during the post landing inspection 148 of the orbiters tiles were found shattered and 16 more were missing due to the effects of an overpressure wave while that and other issues were addressed the 50-ton Columbia would be placed atop the specially configured 747 and ferried back to Florida and processing for its next mission it's a massive enterprise it's over eight stories tall sitting on the ground and it's you never get over that sight it's really awesome after the shuttle lands there's a processing procedure for the show post flighting int checking the tires checking the struts major get the right correct measure and then when the shuttle is ready to mate with worthy 747 we would tow underneath and then they would lower the space shuttle down on the supports on top of the aircraft take off on take offs from the extra long runways of Edwards Air Force Base the Shuttle Carrier aircraft crew of four would soon grow accustomed to the smell of burning rubber that's the intense heat generated by their plane spinning tires as they carried two massive aircraft at more than 100 miles an hour the average range of a 747 is about 5,000 miles but due to its weight configuration and special flight requirements the SCA can travel only 1,000 miles at a time a full term in a jet can take several Ziff country to avoid bad cruising at more than 250 miles per hour the jumbo jet burns 40,000 pounds of fuel per hour that's a hundred and thirty pounds per mile or the length of a football field per gallon no wonder it has to make several stops before reaching Florida's east coast we would get a spacecraft back go over it again be sure that we could reuse it repair it where we had to do had never been never been done before and so I think it's one of the marvelous things about the space shuttle was we found a way to turn this spacecraft around and use it again before the end of 1982 Columbia would fly for more mission liftoff of America's space shuttle including STS five the first with a crew of more than two astronauts challenger ii orbit in the shuttle fleet made her maiden flight on april 4th 1983 STS six deployed a communication satellite and feature the first spacewalk of the shuttle era just two months later shuttle Challenger is back in orbit this time with the first American woman in space physicist dr. Sally Ride was a member of commander Bob Crippen's STS 70 that deployed Canadian and Indonesian satellites during the six-day mission challenger was readied for flight in less than two minutes another massive first shuttling the first African American space an Air Force combat pilot guy Bluford for me it was an exciting moment because it was something that I had been training for for 15 to 16 months and so I was looking forward to the experience of flying in space in 1984 286 the newest orbiter discovery would fly a record six missions and liftoff liftoff of mission 51 d and a seven-member crew of discovery carrying into space satellites international astronauts even a US senator and a congressman one year after Discovery's debut Atlantis flew her first mission a new orbiter joins a shuttle fleet and it has cleared the tower STS 51 J there was also one of seven classified missions the space shuttle would fly for the Department of Defense by the end of 1985 the space shuttle program had completed 23 issues including 9 that year alone each successful flight had the under tenant consequence of convincing some that space woman once considered among humankind's most inherently dangerous endeavors had become routine that note would soon be tragically dispelled well I am so excited to be here amid much fanfare christa mcauliffe an elementary school instructor from Concord New Hampshire had been chosen from among 11,000 applicants to be NASA's first teacher in space I would like to humanize the space age by giving a perspective from the nine astronaut because I think the students will look at that and say this is an ordinary person this ordinary person is contributing to history and if they can make that connection then they're going to get excited about history they're gonna get excited about the future they're going to get excited about space the American public's interest in its space program was renewed by her participation and was eager to see her alive commanding the flight was dick Scobee his pilot was Michael Smith serving as challengers mission specialists our Judy Resnik Ellison Onizuka and Ron McNair journey McAuliffe as a payload specialist was Greg Jarvis from the start STS 51 L was plagued by delays mostly due to unseasonally cold temperatures in Florida rather than give pause for thought the delays only tried the nation's patience everyone had seemed was itchy to go January 28th the ground temperature of launch pad 39b was a frigid 36 degrees ice could be seen on the launch vehicle despite concerns voiced by some shuttle managers reluctantly decided to press ahead for a late morning liftoff we have main engine start three two one liftoff of the 25th space shuttle mission and it has cleared the tower challenger go at throttle up at 11:39 booster twice the speed of sound the challengers fuselage breaks apart from the inside out America's space program suffers its first fatality in flight all seven challenger crew members okay everybody stay off the telephones make sure you maintain all your data start pulling it together we come together today to mourn the loss of seven brave Americans to share the grief that we all feel and perhaps in that sharing to find the strength to bear our sorrow and the courage to look for the seeds of hope the investigation headed by former Secretary of State William Rogers would fault a solid rocket booster re-rendered affected by the bitter but the Commission's findings also addressed the human factor the role played by shuttle program managers in sending challenger aloft that day the shuttle program came to a halt it took more than two and a half years of arduous engineering analysis and painful soul-searching before a retooled and reborn shuttle would return to fluid challenge it was tough because it not only represented a breakdown in communications but it just it represented everything that's wrong you know wrong about an agency like like we are we're segments of the agency weren't talking to each other and didn't know everything that we should know we thought we knew where all the risks were and had them pretty well contained the solid rocket boosters had called the accident obviously there was something that had slipped through so we went back throughout you know their complete vehicle all the systems and did a complete review and trying to find any other things that we may have missed that may be lurking there when things are really starting to look smooth and you're starting to get maybe overconfident in a way then it's time for you to step back think about what you're doing go back and look do some additional testing and see if there's something that you really hadn't anticipated that is going on with your systems your a lot of that time we got a lot of criticism that maybe the agency lost its edge there were folks inside the agency that started started losing their confidence thinking maybe we can't do this anymore two and a half years later and we flew and then landed that flight and showed that no we really can't overcome really really large problems will tough technical problems today just like we could 10 years ago 20 years ago 150 years ago that was that was an important milestone every clears the on September 29th 1988 975 days after the loss of Challenger and her crew the orbiter discovery returns six veteran astronauts to space to deploy a tracking and data relay Center important to a number of NASA missions STS 26 proved to come back milestone over space chakra and initiated a tradition that survives with the program today during the flight we had roses show up in the Mission Control Center six roses five red one white and there was a card attached to it and it simply said congratulations return to flight we wish you well and it was signed Marc Terry and Mackenzie Shelton didn't know who they were but after the flight we threw the floral company we tracked them down so we could send him some pictures and and something to thank them for sending the roses to Mission Control so the next slide roses show up again and again it's five roses for the members of the crew and one rose for those who have lost their lives in this endeavour and so this family they have become part of our family and they haven't missed a flight since every flight since that time and in to date and I suspect they're going to go right with us to the end the shuttle program STS 26 ended on October 30 1988 at Edwards Air Force Base California with discoveries safe landing on runway one set the triumphant crew was greeted warmly by Vice President George Bush on behalf of a proud and grateful nation there's something special about a return to flight that that makes you you have some trepidation because it's still fresh in your mind that you're frail and and you can make mistakes and you're human in the spring of 1990 the one and a half billion dollar Hubble Space Telescope was loaded into Space Shuttle Discovery's payload Bay and on April 24th was sent aloft to be deployed to earth orbit on sts-31 early discovery go for Hubble release as envisioned Hubble would return never-before-seen images detailing our universe as it was millions upon millions of years before soon it would become clear that Hubble pictures were not several days later if not a couple of weeks we found out after we were back on earth that it had a problem with its vision and most of us were just devastated you know that year we had this marvelous instrument that we had put on orbit and it was gonna be useless it turned out that it wasn't useless at all because even as with its flaw it was still a much better telescope than anything if we had you know on earth a shuttle mission dedicated to the telescope's repair was planned in essence Hubble's nearsightedness would be corrected with a new pair of glasses liftoff of the space shuttle Endeavour on an ambitious mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope we finally flew sts-61 which was the first Hubble servicing nation absolutely incredible mission you cannot take the 84 inch mirror out of the telescope it's part of structure too big it's there so by putting in one box called co-star and we're able to correct air brake light for five other instruments of all the space shuttle missions we've flown it was without a doubt the most ambitious flight but the one that I think demonstrated NASA's can-do attitude its technological skill its technical capability and the spirit of its people two teams of astronauts made a record five back-to-back spacewalks to refurbish Hubble and realize her potential to all and a staff while Hubble servicing missions were very important the true gift of a maneuverable shuttle assume realized in a very different rescue mission booster ignition and liftoff of the maiden voyage of Endeavour on a satellite rescue mission months earlier in May of 1992 the seven astronauts of sts-49 overcame initial setbacks to pluck the hundred and eighty million dollar Intel SATs six communication satellite from an unusable orbit it was going to be a very simple rendezvous you know get close bring the satellite down close and grapple it with the remote manipulator system everything that could go wrong went wrong they got up there to capture it the bar we tap the satellite and the and the with the bar and the satellite started moving out of control it can be very difficult catching something like a tumbling satellite in space the slightest touch or miss touch by the astronaut with the equipment and you can send that satellite tumbling here like you're the one who I'm in a jar like you say alright okay the other time right is just right so it was very touch-and-go on that mission actually commander Dan brandenstein and pilot Kevin Chilton are preparing for the upcoming terminal initiate burn after several days of failed attempts with endeavours remote arm commander Dan brandenstein literally tries a new approach yeah real easy guys and endeavors helm brandenstein delicately maneuvers the orbiter up to the four and a half tonne Intelsat six the satellite is is rolling out of control in three different axes at once and you could actually fly the shuttle and fly this maneuver around and keep it aligned with it right here three people grabbed 18,000 pounds aware that any miscue could endanger not only the satellite but also the ride home spacewalkers peer through it Tom Akers and Rick he'd reach out and secure the satellite by hand a night job guys until sat 6 is released from the cargo bay with a new mini rocket motor for a gentle push to its proper orbit where it remains today fully functional and as the shuttle program ature so it seemed it relationships between the worlds spacefaring nations on STS 47 the 50th space shuttle mission saw the orbiter endeavour back in space on September 12 1992 the mission was a cooperative Space Lab venture between Japan and the United States that brought the first Japanese astronaut into orbit as a member of the seven person shuttle foods the Space Shuttle has launched people from different nations around this world that used to feel they could never ever work together and it has ushered us from the Cold War to this really cooperative space program that we have with our international partners including the former Soviet regardless of what language you speak you speak in love space and that's pretty cool people we have a lot in common with engineers and scientists that's kind of fun working program like this on february 3rd 1995 Eileen Collins the first woman to pilot a shuttle was at the helm as discovery gave the u.s. its first up-close look at the MIR Space Station Collins flew the shuttle through a series of intricate maneuvers approaching within 37 feet of the Russian spacecraft and later performing the fly around by hand and liftoff with a space shuttle Atlantis on a mission that will herald a new day of international cooperation in space four months later on June 27th 1995 shuttle Atlantis would lift off from the Kennedy Space Center to begin STS 71 the u.s. space programs one hundredth human space mission it would take two more days before Atlantis caught up with and performed the first shuttle docking with the MIR space station orbiting 220 miles above the earth the most unique and historic celebration took place as the MIR Space Station welcomed its first American guests cosmonauts and astronauts together broke figurative bread tortillas and fruit to be exact in a renewed spirit of cooperation together shuttle and MIR formed the largest flying spacecraft the world had yet to see it tipped the scales at 250 metric tons more than a half a million pounds between 1994 98 the shuttle-mir program would involve 11 shuttle missions including in 1996 STS 76 which he began a continuous u.s. presence aboard the Russian space station with a visit by Atlantis barely fluent in Russian astronaut Shannon lucid a biochemist embarked upon a mission that would dramatically enhance our understanding of life in space when she finally landed at Edwards Air Force Base on shuttle Atlantis she held the female space endurance record for spending a hundred and eighty eight days in orbit a hero's welcome was in store I'm here to say welcome home to Shannon lucid by the time shuttle Mir ended with STS 91 seven American astronauts had completed extended stays aboard the Russian space station Tatiana met Eva I became very good friends with and I remember us sitting in Red Square having dinner together with a full moon and remembering when I was a child all those those parades as May Day parades with the tanks going by and here we were sitting there having a nice dinner under the with a lot of friendship so it just goes to show how space can unite people and that's one of I think one of the biggest benefits eight cosmonauts had flown to Mir on the u.s. shuttle and NASA astronaut norm thagard had become the first American to fly there or any aboard a Soyuz space in 2001 15 years after its commissioning Muir would be abandoned to break up and burn in Earth's atmosphere by then the process of building upon mears legacy of international cooperation in space had already begun whereas sts-61 had helped establish the hubble space telescope as an icon of American ingenuity sts-95 would update the heroes credentials of one john clam on october 29th 1998 almost 37 years after becoming the first American to orbit the earth as an original mercury 7 astronaut Glenn now a 77 year old former US senator made his return to space in contrast to his first flight a three orbit four and a half hour for a inside the snug friendship 7 capsule liftoff of discovery with a crew of six astronauts heroes one American legend sts-95 would take eight days and circle the earth 134 times my main reason for being on that shuttle flight was to do research on Aging I was 77 we went up and you know NASA has charted some 52 different things changes that occur in the human body and you've been to space for a period of time and the several of those are very similar to what happens to the natural process of Aging right here on earth body's immune system changes you get less resistant to disease and infection body's ability to absorb protein back into the muscles changes for the young people up there and for elderly here on earth the objective was to take those things that are the same and see if we couldn't find any differences between my experience up there and they're younger and the younger people I would fly with and with the idea of finding in the human body what turns these different systems on and off if we could do that we might be able to make it possible for people to stay in space longer but without harmful effects and maybe cut out some of the frailties of old age right here on earth I really was happy to be because that flight an interesting twist of fate astronaut Glenn not only inspired both the young and old around the globe but also a fresh political science and economics graduate lori garver the 18th deputy administrator of nasa having the ability at nasa to fly him again in space after his first flight was something we I think gave the nation and it really helped explain what we were doing on the space shuttle John Glenn was very very focused on doing that experience those experiments for both I think the older generation but he was also an inspiration to people growing up discovery carried a variety of payloads and research experiments arguably the one most valuable was Glenn himself not only did he provide first-time data on what spaceflight might do to the body of a septa Gennari Glenn also renewed the interest of the nation and the world in America's space shuttle program while the program had and continued to successfully deploy winning service science probes and satellites as well as conduct on-orbit research the Space Shuttle undertook a new long-range task perfectly suited to her specialized capabilities you've got a spacecraft that can carry at least seven people into orbit and with those seven people you can do a huge amount of work one mission you can do multiple evh you've got multiple crew members you've got a huge payload and it's all kinds of capabilities to be able to construct less than two weeks after the Glenn's returned to Earth a Russian Proton rocket departs the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan carrying the Zarya module the first component of the new International Space Station liftoff of the proton rocket and the Zarya control module International Space Station is underway two weeks after that space shuttle Endeavour follows up with delivery of America's unity module the second piece of this largest space station puzzle ever to be constructed oh yeah mob until July 2000 will the Russian Zvezda module yet finally allowing for treating Russian cosmonauts and their American expedition one commander bill shepherd to journey aboard a Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station and begin humankind's continuous extraterrestrial presence across the world people are very very interested in and delighted by the International Space Station and the science that has taken place there since only an orbiters payload Bay could hold the station's largest components the multi-year multi-million servicing of the ISS with cargo and crew would become primarily a job for the shuttle amid these dynamic station building missions one seemingly simple and relatively uncomplicated flight would prove problematic and threaten the very future of America's human spaceflight program since 1988 the Space Shuttle had completed 15 years of successful missions each was unique each had its own specific goals and tasks and each had its own dedicated crew of astronauts who trained exhaustively to meet and carry them out yet each of those 87 flights did have two things in common the safe launch liftoff of the space shuttle Discovery the safe land nose gear touchdown for the starch sts-107 seemed to be a mission out of sorts by the time Columbia was finally ready to fly on January 16th 2003 its planned 16-day mission had been delayed no fewer than 18 times all those delays have ultimately positioned the sts-107 as a sort of black sheep on the space shuttle programs launch schedule Columbia's crew commander Rick husband pilot Willie McCool and mission specialists Michael Anderson kapner chavala Dave Brown Laurel Clark and Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon would not go the National Space Station their flight would require nothing more risky than orbiting the earth booster ignition and liftoff of space shuttle Columbia with a multitude and International Space Research experiments 82 seconds after launch what was later described as a suitcase size transcript frozen foam insulation breaks off Columbia's external tank and strikes the leading edge of the orbiters left wing a routine same-day video review of the launch would reveal nothing unusual however higher resolution tracking camera film processed overnight and reviewed on flight day - by the missions assent team showed otherwise you saw this little thing float toward the leading edge of the wing and like you know it was like a snowball hitting something and then just being pulverized but but when you saw it hit ooh we just we just winced because we knew you know the vehicles going 500 miles an hour or better it was inconceivable in hindsight that you could have that kind of impact at the speed that the vehicle was going and assumed that there was no damage and that's what we we allowed ourselves to feel comfortable that we were right and we were dead wrong due to limitations in the visual clarity the exact point of impact and extent of any damage could not be determined if the foam strike had compromised Columbia's integrity little if anything can be done to repair the orbiter in space one week after launch Mission Control emails the crew informing of the debris strike save for a relatively minor problem with a leaky refrigeration unit sts-107 had been without further incident as scheduled the order is given on the morning of February first for the Columbia crew to begin the landing procedure and come home to Florida traveling in excess of 12,000 miles per hour the orbiters belly begins to glow red as it descends into Earth's atmosphere that's why I have just lost four separate temperature transducers on the left side of the vehicle hydraulic return temperatures as reentry started and as the ground track went went across the states there's a the ground track that course changes color you can tell where the shuttle is over what part of the country it is well that display stopped update you in other words that display to froze in a certain position well sometimes you have loss of data you have some problem with the system on the ground of where you'll have those kind of outages temporarily well this lasted a bit longer then the call went up to the crew you know call went up and no response well I know I just I just began to feel uneasy Columbia Houston UHF comm check at speeds above Mach 20 the stress becomes too much for the orbiter we do not have any valid data at this time the suitcase sized chunk of folk had indeed touched a bowling ball sized hole in the leading edge of Columbia's left wing within seconds internal temperatures spiked signaling the cascade of structural disintegration only 16 minutes from home space shuttle Columbia breaks apart in the skies over East Texas all seven crew members GC plant-wide is a block the doors happy at that moment I knew I knew we lost him the grief is heavy our nation shares in your sorrow and in your pride and today we remember not only one moment of tragedy but seven lives of great purpose and achievement within days hundreds of professionals from federal and state agencies across the country arrived in these Texas they are joined by local volunteers to help NASA recover and catalog debris from Columbia in the hopes of literally piecing together an answer to the accidents caused this is one of the many obstacles investigators are up against it was really heartwarming and very emotional for me too to see all of these people from around the country come in the Piney Woods of East Texas and spend days and weeks there marching out through these through the woods looking for bits and pieces of their orbiter and so forth if anybody ever wonders about the the strength of the backbone of this country then they ought to have the privilege like I do to meet these people who have come here to do this it just it shows you the fabric of what this country is made of determined to return to flight stronger and safer the grounded shuttle program had taken a fresh look at itself during my watch during my watch we lost the Columbia crew and clearly as a flight director of a context crew I think about those every day every day I come to work I need to be very vigilant I need to pay attention and I need the people that work for us in this business to pay attention to what you're doing because this is hard stuff that we do it's very dangerous we have not figured out a way to do a beam me up Scottie right now it takes a lot of hydrocarbons moving at very high speeds to fuel pumps at very high temperatures high pressures to get into space and it takes a tremendous amount of effort to get out of space back in the atmosphere and get to get home I was sent out to David Brown's parents home I'll never forget this moment when Judge Brown looked at me and said Leland my son is gone there is nothing can do to bring him back but the biggest tragedy would be if you don't continue to fly and carry on his legacy each of the remaining three orbiters was pulled apart and refurbished new capabilities were devised for the crew and mission controllers to assess and repair damage while on orbit processes and procedures were also reexamined and reinvigorated cruise safety would never again be taken for granted nearly two and a half years would pass before the nation would see another orbiter poised for launch from the Kennedy Space Center the time that we fly the flight it's something that it feels like we have flown many times so if things don't go well it becomes very very natural for us to know at certain points during the mission if this doesn't go well or if this significant system breaks when we have this type of emergency what's the most important thing we need to do now because we've been rehearsing it and it makes it look really easy you don't really get the full effect of how much real preparation how much real studying went into making it look that easy of all the changes accompanying the shuttles return to flight none was more significant than the one announced in early 2004 at NASA headquarters by President Bush our first goal is to complete the International Space Station by 2010 we will finish what we have started we will meet our obligations to our 15 international partners on this project the shuttles chief purpose over the next several years will be to help finish Assembly of the International Space Station in 2010 the Space Shuttle after nearly 30 years of Duty will be retired from service even though each shuttle was designed to fly 100 missions the Columbia accident investigation board called the shuttle an aging spacecraft with the odds of losing another orbiter and crew increasing with each subsequent flight NASA's human spaceflight program was faced with several basic challenges including coming up with a successor to the shuttle fleet however with an impending cancellation of the shuttle program looming shuttle managers recommitted themselves to the paramount task of safely completing the International Space Station it would become the program's mantra to be repeated over and over again not only to the media but also for every word in the shuttle program no launch schedule was too tight and no mission too important to be rushed we are to treat every flight in a sense as a return to flight this is truly a test program we go back we make sure everything is right we double-check and then we go commit into Flight Readiness review that we're actually ready to go fly on July 26 2005 discovery gets the shuttle program flying again this is shuttle launch control at t-minus 3 hours as our pilot now into the suit up row alerting elodie years ago million people who believe so deeply what we do good luck Godspeed and have a little fun up there t-minus 10 seconds go for main engine start seven six five three engines up and burning three two one and liftoff of space shuttle Discovery beginning America's new journey and the vehicle has cleared the tower among the many changes instituted the new r-bar pitch maneuver or backflip will be used by each mission to the International Space Station at arrival the end over end flip allows the station crew to visually document the condition of the shuttles valium notes discovery and the sts-114 crew safely began a final phase of the shuttle programs historic journey with a smooth pre-dawn landing on August 9th 2005 at the Edwards Air Force Base California DD ray sweetie handy Vegas charlie Wendy and Eileen welcomed home friends with this practically rebuilt space transportation system each remaining shuttle mission would be safer than the one before and its final flight the safest it's almost like we've had kind of three different space shuttle programs first 10 years we're off learning how to fly the thing deploying satellites and flying laboratories in the bag review next 10 years we're doing more of that and we're going out on more and more spacewalks and we fly up to the MIR space station and in the last 10 years we use it to build about a million pound space station in orbit which wouldn't have been possible without Shaw it's a heck of a machine when you look at the Hubble Space Telescope that would not have been possible without shuttle and you look at the International Space Station which certainly would not have been possible without shuttle every launch is an emotional experience watching what this nation is done but nASA has done with the NASA contractor team it's awesome it's wonderful we didn't spend a dime in space not one single penny has been spent in space every single penny that went into the space shuttle program over its 30-plus years was spent right here on earth 1 creating jobs growing our economy creating technological development of which we never dreamed advancing science and technology even advancing the field of Aeronautics it just impresses me what people can do what people can do it's a it's a big machine it's a nice machine it's a fantastic engineering marvel in my opinion the whole space shuttle but what's the real marvel is behind it then make it go having a space show enabled us to be able to complete our science and do some really great things to advance the area of metallurgy without the space shuttle an experiment like this one could not have been conducted the shuttle is very important for us to learn and be able to conduct long period experiments out of the 50 states 48 of them have vendors that provide parts or equipment to the the space shuttle program so it's a vast cross-section of America that bakes the American space program what it is change is inevitable as much as people don't like change that's the only thing that's constant in our lives and we have to change we have to transition from shuttle to a new future which we're going to define which can be even better a future that allows us to explore beyond our home planet to seek our destiny to learn what we couldn't possibly learn if we were stuck in low-earth orbit and since its returned to flight the shuttle program has been almost singularly focused on completing construction of the space station I think back of all the challenges and all the things that had to work right you know a lot of these interfaces never came together before all the shuttle flights the 20-plus shuttle flights that went into assembly all the Soyuz flights to progress flights to see this station come together in assembly is a true testimony to the international partnership this is probably the most amazing research facility ever constructed in space and it's constructed internationally and it operates every day 24 hours a day doing world-class research internationally and there is no more amazing facility than what we have in orbit through and possibly beyond 2020 the ISS will serve as the world's first full-time research laboratory in microgravity among zero-g experiments already conducted aboard the station several have led to promising breakthroughs in research and treatment of cancer many other on-orbit science findings have the potential to significantly improve the quality of life back on earth in May 2009 Atlantis and its sts-125 crew took to space not to visit the ISS but to return to the Hubble Space Telescope for its final servicing mission on five spacewalks Atlantis astronauts repaired and upgraded a Hubble telescope to significantly improve its capacity to explore the depths of the universe until at least 2014 I think of all the finger prints that are all over this thing it's a phenomenal piece of machinery it's a phenomenal airplane and its really as an engineering mark the Space Shuttle will go down in history as one of the great flying machines that Americas has produced a space shuttle you know at this time was a vehicle for bringing people together from all around the planet and having us work in harmony for the betterment of humankind we may not have understood when we first built it what all we'd be able to accomplish with it and after many years we've realized just how useful it has been it's been a learning experience on how to operate and live in space what can you say about the Space Shuttle it has changed everything well the shuttle from my perspective is one of the great things that this nation has done it was a lot of pride like I said it's it's inspiring to come to work every single day to work on this program I'd go tomorrow if I had the opportunity for more than 30 years the fleet of thousands of Americans dedicated to its safety and success have toiled in exhilarating triumph heartbreaking tragedy and most often quiet obscurity their contributions have extended beyond the bounds of space among others shuttle-derived technologies have been used in developing an artificial heart and limbs three-dimensional biotechnology a light for treating tumors and children and improving crime prevention and wildfire detection from crawler driver to payload specialist from scuba dive to pilot from scientist to engineer they and many likely throughout the nation share a commitment to sending humankind safely into space that dedication as much as any other acclaim will be the legacy of America's space shuttle I think we'll be remembered in thousands of years you know as perhaps the most incredible technological feat of humans of our time as is the order of life an ending for the Space Shuttle becomes a beginning for a space bound successor soon America will again send astronauts into orbit and beyond to do what NASA does best explore you"

For the curious minded:
-Not every Apollo mission happened exactly like this (for example the exact times for stage separation were different).
-The day of the launch, the Astronauts (and a few support people) were the only ones with 3 miles of the launch site.
-There were 13 successful launches of the Saturn V rocket.

#nasa #saturnv #b3d",How the Apollo Spacecraft works: Part 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dpkmUjJ8xU,-1,765485,6974,220,585,8dpkmUjJ8xU,"The Apollo Spacecraft was the incredible machine that allowed astronauts to walk on the moon. It was split up into 3 parts the Command Module, the Service Module and the Lunar Module. Later on, we'll talk about what each module does, but first, let's talk about the launch vehicle that gets us into orbit. The Saturn Five rocket. Each mission was launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida. Mission Control was all the way in Houston, Texas. The Saturn Five rocket was 363 feet tall. Just to get a good size comparison, here's the size of a person, and here is the size of a Boeing 747. The Saturn Five was split up into 3 stages; they referred to each stage by a technical name. The first stage was called the S-1C and was powered by five F1 rocket engines. The second stage was called the S2, and was powered by five, slightly smaller, J2 rocket engines. The third stage was called the S-4B and was powered by only one J2 rocket engine. The actual spacecraft, was stored up at the top of the rocket stages. Here is the Lunar Module, which would actually land on the Moon. During the launch, it was protected by four panels, known as the spacecraft Lunar Module adapter. The Service Module contain the engines necessary to enter and leave lunar orbit as well as fuel cells and other electrical components. The Command Module is where the 3 astronauts spent most of their time. At the very top,  you'll find the Launch Escape System. In the event of an emergency, it would carry the Command Module safely away from the rocket. The structure you see next to the Saturn Five is called the Launch Umbilical Tower. You'll notice there are 9 service arms that provide access to the Saturn Five. On the day of the launch, the 3 astronauts ride an elevator to the top service arm. The White Room is where they enter the Command Module. Four of the service arms are moved out of the way before the launch. The First Stage ignites 8 seconds before the Saturn Five leaves the ground. As the Saturn Five starts to rise, the remaining 5 service arms quickly rotate to get out of the way. It takes about 12 seconds for the rocket to completely clear the tower. As the Saturn Five picks up speed, the astronauts will feel as much as 4 G's, or 4 times the amount of gravity pressing them into their seats. The First Stage shuts off at 2 minutes 42 seconds at a height of about 42 miles. Explosive bolts detonate releasing the first stage, letting it to fall back down to the Atlantic Ocean; shortly after, the second stage fires up. We're high enough in the atmosphere now, that the Launch Escape System is no longer needed. The second stage shuts off at 9 minutes and 12 seconds at a height of 109 miles. The third stage fires up for a short amount of time to get the astronauts into a Parking Orbit of 118 miles. We'll talk more about the Parking Orbit in the next video. It shuts off at 11 minutes and 39 seconds, but does not detach yet. One of the hardest parts of the mission is over, but the adventure doesn't stop here. Please join me in part two, as we continue our journey towards the Moon."

   to ""The Jersey Shore-acle."" I transcend dimensions,
   I speak to spirits,  I live off Exit Nine
    off the turnpike. So, today, I have been
  summoned to the home    of an adorable little boy  and his adult friend
  who he barely knows.   My name is Stuart,
  and I'm 12 years old. I'd say
 I'm a pretty happy kid.    That is,   until it showed up.    Its name is Adam,    and he's making Halloween
    really not scary.   Eh.  So I'm hoping
  the Jersey Shore-acle can connect me
  with a dead relative. Or a murderer.  Whichever's more terrifying.  Hello, it's so nice
  to meet you. Thank you for having me.  I sensed you needed it,    good, you sat down, okay, we're gonna start this,
  are you ready? Yeah. All right,
 now before we start,  I do have a couple
  of questions, okay?  I need you to tell me--  That mediums are scammers who
  prey on your grief for money?    What is this?    It's in my contract no one
    can have bigger hair than me. Adam, she's going
 to contact the dead for me. It's an age-old tradition.   It sure is,    a tradition of faking it and ripping people off.  Séances first became
   popular in America    during the 19th century, when three young ladies
  named the Fox sisters   started charging admission  to watch them   communicate with the dead. If there be any ghosts
  in this room, may they knock.   (knock knock knock)    And if those ghosts think
  people should give us money,   also knock.   (knocking)  (gasps)   As they grew up,
   the Fox sisters became   bona-fide celebrities,   touring and holding
   packed sessions   multiple times a day. Sorry, darling,
 we couldn't possibly fit you in, we're talking to Shakespeare
  and Attila the Hun at noon.   But later in life,
  Maggie Fox spilled the beans  and revealed
 how they tricked their public, making knocking sounds   using an apple on a string   and writing secret messages    with their feet.  I feel the spirit... wait for it... (Adam)
  Despite Maggie's confession,
    the spiritualism movement continued to this day,   and modern mediums
    still make bank.   Famous mediums even
 have best-selling books    and hit TV shows. Yes, TV shows
 that are totally real!    That's right,
    the higher the hair,
    the closer to heaven,    okay, enough chit-chat,
    let's start this reading. Oh, yeah, I'm feeling
 something very powerful. Oh, yeah,
 it's a presence. Did you lose someone
 with a J name,    like a John,
    a Jack, a Julia-- Yes, my grandpa's
 name was Jason.  Bam! That's it. Okay-- oh, oh...  oh, I'm feeling a pain.  Oh, yeah,
  in my chestal area. Is there any type of thing that
 happened in that region area? Yes, he-- he died
 of lung cancer. Bada-bingo, what you
 think about that, Mr. Everything, huh?   Okay, so...
   your grandfather's
   telling me, oh,  something about
  a book, why?    Why?  Uh...    I think he owned a book. And I saw it once.  That's it.
  That's it.  He wants me to tell you
  he cherishes those moments,    and he loves you. Boom, shut up, I'm done. That was amazing! How do you explain that? Simple, she was
  doing a cold reading.  Uh... who this?    You're not a spirit,
    I did not summon you.    Okay, can we cut?  (bell ringing) This is Mark Edward. He's a magician who went
 undercover as a psychic medium to research
 how they scam people. I used to do everything
 she does for a living,   and I can tell you
 exactly how it's done.    Cold reading is a series
   of questions and statements that mine you for information,
  without you even knowing it. First, the medium lists  common names
  to guess at a match. And they start
  with just the initial   so that you fill in
   the blank.    Oh. Yeah.  I know tons of people
  with J names. And lots of them are dead.   Mediums then offer details
  which sound specific    but are actually quite generic.  Chest pains could be
   lung cancer, heart disease,   or really anything.    No, no, I sensed that
    he died because of  something in the chest. Or the head.   Uh-huh? Definitely
   somewhere in the body. Finally, she offered a question
    phrased like a statement to make you do the work
 and make a connection.  Honey, sugar, the book.  It was real, right? Actually, no. Grandpa hated books. Now that I'm thinking of it,
 I was thinking of his TV Guide.   By using questions
   that could apply to anyone and judging your body language
 to see how you respond, mediums manipulate you into thinking they know things
 nobody else could know.    And since they often work
   in group settings,   if they don't get it right,    they just move on
  to someone else in the room.  I mean, how about you, haircut?
 You know something about a book? No-- somebody here must know
 something about a book. Ugh! Why did I ever buy this?   Well, cold reading
    often seems supernatural  because it's a truly
 amazing skill.    But that's all it is.   A really good magic trick. And while there's nothing wrong
 with a little illusion,  it is straight-up unethical  to take advantage
  of other people's grief   for your own gain.   I've even seen people lose
  their entire savings because a medium convinced them    to hand it over. You scammer!
 How do you even
 sleep at night? Okay, calm down.    Everyone just
   take a minute, close your eyes, okay,
 just imagine smoke or whatever.  Poof, I'm gone.    It's time for me   to go, too.  Just kidding. It's an editing trick."

to watchmojo.com in this installment we're counting down the five most interesting and surprising things that we could learn about NASA the USA's National Aeronautics and Space Administration I'd like to present the new generation of NASA astronaut the average American number five they don't pay their petty fines what do you own space no NASA does NASA rocket people perhaps you've heard of them NASA may be out of this world but it isn't above the law and it has a way weirder than average history of rule breaking in 1979 when the aborted Skylab mission re-entered the Earth's atmosphere scattering debris in Western Australia NASA was issued a ticket for littering by the Shire of esperance the fine was only paid up in 2009 after a US radio DJ source donations from his listeners the agency has a parking ticket to its name too after Gregory W Nimitz and his company orbital development laid claim to asteroid 433 eros the precise location onto which NASA landed it's near shoemaker spacecraft in 2001 I have unpaid parking tickets the twenty dollar fine was again unpaid perhaps the most incredible of NASA's brushes with the law came in 1997 however when it was sued by three men from Yemen for trespassing on Mars the men claimed the whole planet has been passed down to them by their ancestors they later started selling plots of it for around $2 per square meter when NASA landed its Pathfinder Rover to explore the Red Planet it had effectively invaded it according to the immense case the claim was never taken especially seriously number four NASA has less funding than most think for now according to polls the majority of Americans believe that huge amounts of the u.s. budget are given to NASA with some reports claiming that the average person thinks 20% of the country's spending goes its way well our object collision budgets a million dollars that allows us to track about 3% of the sky and in your part sir but it's a big-ass sky according to official figures however the US government spent most on space travel in the mid-60s with a four point four one percent of budget high point in 1966 that number has been below 1% since the 70s and recently has been around half a percent regardless evidence suggests that NASA could prove a very sound investment in the long term asteroid and Moon mining is set to be a sensationally lucrative venture as business pioneers look to the skies for valuable minerals which are abundant in space but rare on earth there are plans to build platinum mines on the moon in particular some experts say that space mining could be a reality by 2025 remember the asteroid 433 eros its quote-unquote owners estimate the Platinum found on it to be worth about half a quintillion dollars what was once one small step for man could soon become one giant paycheck for mankind number three they are prolific inventors spacebot love it NASA's super scientific team is responsible for more than just rocket ships countless everyday inventions our result of its work home insulation improved as NASA needed to keep astronauts safe during dramatic temperature changes on the Apollo missions water filter systems were developed to prevent sickness and bacteria spread in space freeze-dried food was developed in partnership with Nestle to bolster food stocks for long-haul missions and through various experiments aiming to keep unmanned flights airborne for long as possible NASA made huge advances in solar power technology and if all that doesn't impress we've saved the best for last Lonnie G Johnson aka the inventor of the Super Soaker was once a NASA engineer one thing NASA didn't invent the space pen writes upside down they use this in space an urban legend has it that they spent millions on creating them while the Soviets simply used a pencil NASA actually used pencils too until the pressurized space ready pen was invented by Paul Fisher of Fisher Space Pen Co that's some good pen writes upside down number 2 astronaut training involves brains brawn and maybe Michael Bay there is no doubt that astronaut training is an incredibly difficult experience an astronaut training sucks complete ass literally the NASA Canada program is divided into three main sections basic advanced and intensive training and takes up to two years to complete in that time would be astronauts receive various

massive amounts of work required training at NASA is a lot of heavy textbooks and even heavier exercise routines but there are some lighter moments this is a hard claim to verify but reportedly new

scientific breakthrough and while we have yet to achieve warp drive and NASA is often quick to downplay any progress made it's not for the want of trying news TV parking brake on news of initial tests on a revolutionary warp drive engine broke in April 2015 after a team at Johnson Space Center generated a small amount of thrust using the M drive a British invention which bounces microwaves around a chamber to produce energy there are theories that the method could inspire fuel free travel faster than the speed of light thereby defying Einstein's theory of relativity but the technology is still

 people who still believe that the moon landing
 didn't actually happen and I kind of feel like we
 should get to the bottom of this and see if we can
 recreate the moon landing then maybe there's a
 possibility that that could have actually have been
 done on a sound stage back in 1969. (beeps and distorted messages) - There's lots of compelling evidence that the moon landing did happen. (beeps) And there's actually a
 lot of compelling evidence that maybe the moon landing was staged. (exciting music) - So I've actually done a
 lot of research on this. - Going into your research
 what were some of your doubts that it happened? - I was confused about how they filmed it, If they were just stepping
 out who put the camera there? But they have that
 completely like documented. There was this guy, Stan
 Lebar, who invented a camera that was in the side of the
 lunar module when Neil Armstrong was stepping out he like pulled
 a lever that flipped it open and that's how they got his steps. - Sure they filmed it,
 but to broadcast it live from the moon, that
 seems pretty difficult, especially using slow scan
 television which is like one image for each frame of video
 that they had to then send to Australia when then had to be changed into broadcast format. (intense music) - If there's no wind on the moon right? How come the flag is blowing in the wind? - Inertia, which is a force
 of once an object is in motion it remains in motion, so from
 the force of them putting it into the ground that's where
 the movement comes from and there wasn't like gravity
 or force in the atmosphere to like stop it. - A lot of people think
 that there was a version that was filmed just in case
 they weren't able to make it to the moon or land on the moon. - It makes sense that they
 would have a back up plan because we had to show that we
 actually landed on the moon. We had to beat the Russians. - Yeah. - Do you guys wanna get down
 to the bottom of this or what? (table agrees) - Let's do it. - The day has come we're going
 to recreate the moon landing on this awesome sound stage. We got a pulley rope system hooked up. We have the harness which is
 gonna be used to pull me up like I'm on the moon's landscape
 and it's gonna be awesome. (upbeat music) How do we keep the flag like in the motion that it looks like in the video? - Wire, with a little bit of fan. - We got our flag right here which will simulate anti-gravity. It's time to create the
 landscape of the moon. (bouncy music) - I think just piling
 dirt is not going to work just because we're not
 going to get the detail and the shadows just from dirt, so what I'd like to do is kind
 of, is still get some dirt and sand but put it
 strategically in places and then use pieces of like rock foam. - Anything that we do end up
 having to do in post production we're going to try to do as
 accurately to what tools they had available at the time. So we're not going to use any CGI, we're only going to use very
 simple compositing tricks that are similar to what
 they would have been able to do at the time using front projection, which is what a lot of
 experts think was used to fake the footage. We're gonna try to extend
 this surface in post to make it feel like there's
 much bigger moon surface here. - Okay, so we got the astronaut
 NASA suits right in here. This is about to be the
 ultimate unboxing video. Are you ready? - I'm so excited. Whoa! - Here's my oxygen pack so
 I can breathe in fake space. - So I'm getting suited up right now. They're making sure I'm super safe and that I don't break any legs. (grunts) I feel like the belle of the ball. Oh my god. - I think this is gonna work. - I don't know if this is gonna work. - I think the point will get across. - Okay, I'm just gonna kinda bounce around and just do it. (laughs) like you're in jello. Slow. - Yeah, it just takes a second, okay. (exciting music) - So since we don't actually
 have two astronauts, we're gonna take Ricky here and we've already filmed
 him once doing the kind of floating motion and now
 we're going to film him again on the other side of the
 flag as the second astronaut and then we'll composite them
 together with a split screen. - Cool. - Cool, let's do it. It's going a little bit too fast. Yeah, now you look like you're in space. (upbeat music) What I'm doing right now is compositing using digital versions
 of the same techniques that would have been available
 to filmmakers at the time. (drum roll) (intense music plays) you can see the stars and
 stripes on the (mumbles). (transmission) (dramatic music)"

Every other Wednesday we present a new video, so join us to see the truth laid bare...

Has planet earth ever had a close encounter with aliens?

While UFOs and their occupants have been part of our culture for more than a century, and people from many walks of life claim to have seen them, we have no indisputable evidence that they’re fact rather than fiction, or do we?  Naked Science speaks to witnesses of two of the most controversial UFO sightings, the Rendlesham Forest incident in the UK and the Phoenix Lights sighting in the US, as well as the most famous UFO incident of all time, Roswell.

If unidentified flying objects did come from space, how could they have travelled to earth?  And how could they survive in our atmosphere?  We talk to leading physicists and astrophysicists about the viability of interstellar travel and whether worm holes and warp drives could make it possible.  Or perhaps extra-terrestrials will send tiny self-replicating nanobots to explore our Earth?

Close encounters originated with reported sightings of alien craft, but in the last few decades alien contact has taken a new and more terrifying twist, alien abduction.  We talk to a so called ‘experiencer’ who claims to have been taken from her bed and experimented on.  She believes her claims but could there be another, scientific, explanation for what she remembers?  We talk to a neuroscientist who thinks he has the answer.

Finally, Naked Science asks possibly the most shocking question of all, could aliens already be among us?",Naked Science - Close Encounters,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2JhlBi525w,0,2286594,7231,1522,3037,k2JhlBi525w,earth our home planet the only place in the universe known to support life yet could life forms from outer space already have paid us a visit could they even be abducting members of the human race it may seem like science fiction but has planet earth already had a close encounter stories of close encounters with alien life are part of our culture every year in the us there are thousands of reported sightings of ufos unidentified flying objects and some people even claimed to have been abducted by aliens i'm a perfectly normal individual that's had rather extraordinary odd experiences my entire lifetime natural phenomena or even military activities can explain most of the ufo incidents but some still keep people guessing there's no way that it was balloons or an aircraft or helicopters or flares people actually saw a mile to two mile wide craft flying saucers have invaded our planet skeptics argue that such sightings and close encounters are merely figments of our imagination perhaps inspired by science fiction movies and popular culture you have a dream about an alien in the middle of the night what is your alien gonna look like your alien's gonna look like my alien the alien we we both saw on television although even respected scientists admit that real aliens could have the capability to travel vast distances across the cosmos to visit earth there is no law of physics preventing a civilization perhaps a million years more advanced than ours from reaching the planet earth some believe that there is overwhelming evidence that aliens have visited us possibly on many occasions throughout history leaving artifacts and messages ranging from crop circles to the pyramids i saw some strange objects and strange lights i saw some things i couldn't explain they were definitely under intelligent control for those of you that are skeptical i would ask you look at all the incidents there are some very serious things out there some incident really needs some investigation in 1995 dr lynn kaitai saw lights she could not explain near her home in the mountains just north of phoenix arizona she had her camera with her i really concentrated on that top orb that was starting to disappear it didn't budge it just slowly dimmed as if once it disappeared it was still there and i noticed an eerie silence as if time had stopped it was just extraordinary and very strange two years later on march 13th 1997 kaitai was also among the thousands of witnesses who shared a remarkable experience thousands of people statewide were looking up purposely to the sky on a clear beautiful night to catch a glimpse of the hailbop comet when this mile to two mile wide triangle craft traverse the entire state i mean it really went through the most populated corridor of arizona totally totally silent this was a massive parade throughout the state some people find it hard to dismiss the phoenix lights case because there were so many eyewitnesses after a brief investigation the military revealed that the lights were created by flares released from a squadron of aircraft flying in a v formation despite this explanation some people maintain that the lights were otherworldly pyrotechnic expert paul mann has worked with flares for over 23 years he believes that staging this event would be incredibly challenging i think you would find it very difficult to mistake a flare for what people would regard as a ufo although he won't be launching the flares from a fighter jet paul believes that he can explain the difference between flares and the phoenix lights here are flares which will go to about 300 feet high give you a constant burn but you'll see there's a slight flicker in it anybody be able to spot that as a flare rather than a craft so we've got a shimmering red light there lots of smoke you can see the smoke trail the pinpoint of light will give it away as a flare and it falls to the ground it doesn't hover for hours so for anybody who saw the phoenix lights just if it was a pyrotechnic that could last for so long that was quite an achievement and to get it to hold in the sky was something else altogether i know what i saw and thousands of other people know what they saw and it definitely was not flares the characteristics are quite different from these orbs there's no smoke trails these are balls these are orbs that are in rock solid formations the data speak for itself some people believe that flares are an improbable explanation for the lights over phoenix dr michael shermer publisher of skeptic magazine thinks the incident highlights the difficulty of judging the truth about ufos people are poor eyewitnesses all of us judging the size motion and speed of objects in the sky particularly at night or at dusk it's very difficult to do schermer has been writing about the unexplained for over 10 years he questions not only the quality of the evidence but also the reliability of human testimonies when somebody says oh it was 200 meters wide in the sky how do you know was it next to something that you knew the size of already and then you can judge it's twice as big as that no people just make wild ass guesses these wild guesses include mistaking military aircraft weather balloons flares and even the planet venus as alien craft yet such sightings lead many people to believe in the existence of ufos despite logical explanations from scientists and the us government ironically official denials of ufo landings may actually encourage a popular belief in their existence because of a fascination with conspiracy theories and a fear of government cover-ups particularly in the infamous case of roswell roswell this is the mecca of ufology initially the story given that it was a weather balloon was a lie it was a lie because it was a national security secret it was a national security secret until 1995 when the government said that roswell wasn't actually a high altitude weather balloon but a high altitude surveillance balloon to monitor soviet nuclear tests this revelation only serves to convince the ufo community that the government are still covering up whatever did happen at roswell so the ufology people said oh hi you see we've been saying that they lie yeah right but they're saying what it actually is but that's a lie no that makes perfect sense for a cold war atmosphere in 1947. the mystery surrounding roswell has been fueled by misinformation and the shifting official explanation that keeps the story alive yet sometimes even the military themselves spot the unusual in 1980 personnel at an air force base on the east coast of england saw a strange light in a nearby forest deputy base commander colonel charles halt was on duty when he received a strange message from one of his staff when the on-duty police lieutenant came in and insisted on seeing myself in the base commander and talking to us privately he was white as a sheep the lieutenant reported that a strange unidentified flying object had been seen descending into nearby rendelsham forest colonel halt and a disaster preparedness officer visited the supposed landing site they recorded their mission as evidenced all the birds got quiet all the animals in the forest were just silent we approached a site where they said this alleged craft had landed there were three indentations in the ground about an inch and a half to two inches deep about eight to ten inches across they were about six seven maybe eight foot apart in a nice triangular shape being cautious colonel halt and his disaster preparedness officer took radiation readings with their geiger counter the levels were four times higher than normal then something moved in the trees a bright red light with a black center that was moving through the trees it appeared to be shedding something like molten metal almost like steel coming out of a crucible as we stood there and all watching it it silently exploded and broke into multiple white objects that just disappeared many journalists and researchers claim that what colonel halt and others actually saw while in rendelsham forest was in fact the lighthouse at nearby orford ness but colonel halt remains convinced that what he saw wasn't of this world i know what we saw but i don't know what it was my own personal suspicions are that there may have been a craft that was damaged injured or it may have been a reconnaissance vehicle of some type taking a look at all the activity in the area in january 1981 colonel halt contacted the british ministry of defense but never received an official response he is convinced that his close encounter was genuine and that governments cover up this and other ufo cases dr michael shermer is not so sure the problem with government cover-ups like that is people can't keep their mouth shut if aliens were really here and the government was covering up surely some lower echelon person would say i've got the story of a lifetime even if governments were trying to cover up ufo incidents people haven't stopped questioning the official explanations either aliens exist or they don't either thought is frightening for any ufo to get here it would have to travel across space from another part of the universe light years away where might they come from and just how would they get here has earth ever had a close encounter with an alien civilization there have been many supposed sightings of ufos but no definitive evidence of a visit but whether or not aliens have dropped into our own backyard many scientists do believe that they could exist i would be shocked if we were alone it would be an incredible waste of space considering how many galaxies there are there should be lots of planets like ours with life on it the universe is about 14 billion years old and expanding at a phenomenal rate it holds billions and billions of stars far more stars than there are grains of sand on all the beaches on earth and some of these stars have planets orbiting them there are plenty of places from which e.t could originate physicist lawrence krauss believes that the most likely place for e.t to call home would be on a planet similar to our own life seems to form ubiquitously relatively easily in conditions like this so we we would expect one simple way to find life would be to look for planets like earth the problem is that any such planet is going to be a long long way from earth outer space distances are so vast they are measured in light years rather than miles one light year is a distance of nearly six trillion miles that's the distance traveled in one year by a beam of light moving slightly in excess of 186 000 miles per second light from our own sun reaches earth in about eight minutes and takes another ten and a half years to travel to the nearest known planet outside of our solar system any alien planning to visit us from this planet faces a round trip of over 120 trillion miles the only way to shorten the duration of such a journey may be to go faster than the fastest thing we know in the universe light itself in 1905 einstein laid out special relativity and in that theory you cannot go faster than the speed of light there's a cop on the block in some sense that says you can't break the light barrier einstein's theory of special relativity suggests that there is a cosmic speed limit preventing anything and any alien going faster than the speed of light however in 1916 einstein created an even more powerful theory the general theory of relativity it opens up the possibility that instead of beating the laws of physics the answer might be to get around them theoretical physicist michio kaku believes that this holds the key to breaking the light speed barrier space-time is a fabric a fabric that can be stretched and compressed and perhaps even ripped that might give you the possibility to break the light barrier einstein's theory proposes that matter causes space time to curve imagine a heavy ball on a rubber sheet the ball's presence causes the sheet to distort into a hollow if a smaller ball is then dropped onto the sheet it will spiral toward the heavier ball einstein theorized that space like the rubber sheet is warped as objects travel through it and if space can be warped then there may be a novel way to travel from one side of the galaxy to the other if you have a sheet of paper a straight line is the shortest distance between two points however there's a loophole if you want to fold the sheet of paper then you realize the shortest distance between two points is actually a wormhole some scientists suggest that wormholes are space-time tubes which act as shortcuts connecting distant regions of space theoretically an alien using wormholes could travel between two parts of our galaxy faster than a beam of light could travel through normal space and time it's a shortcut first described more than 150 years ago by a mathematician in oxford england that man was the author known as lewis carroll alice's looking glass connects the countryside of oxford to a fantastic world called wonderland and if you were to put your hand through the looking glass your hand would leave oxford and go to the other side of forever that is a wormhole what we physicists call a multiply connected space wormholes may be the ideal transportation network but manipulating the laws of physics could bring catastrophic consequences you don't know how stable they are it may be quite radioactive there may be quantum corrections and radiation as you enter the wormhole or perhaps it will close up even before you can enter it may be possible to artificially create a wormhole but it would take enormous energy and advances in technology way beyond our imagination to rip through the fabric of space and time but maybe there's an alien civilization so advanced that they can build these super galactic highways with ease intelligent aliens may also have found another trick to navigate around the universe perhaps they can actually move space itself as far as we know space can do whatever the heck it wants it can expand and respond to the presence of matter and energy if we could somehow harness that then in principle you might be able to develop something you might call a warp drive the alien craft would collapse the space in front of it and simultaneously expand the space behind it in that way the ship would transfer from one part of the galaxy to another without actually moving an inch it may sound like the stuff of science fiction but for some advanced aliens it could be science fact i can show you with this balloon i have a little replica i've drawn of the uss enterprise from star trek and just so you know the local surroundings have the sun here i have the moon saturn and what i want to show you is that is that the the enterprise could travel away from this star system and towards this star without ever moving with respect to its local surroundings how can i do that well if i squeeze the balloon at this end then i expand this region of the balloon the distance between the starship and these stars has increased but the starship hasn't moved at all with respect to its local surroundings and so what i've done is i've had space do the work nobody knows how a warp drive might be powered and krause believes that its use would be fraught with danger it may not be dangerous for the participants in the spacecraft but it'd be pretty dangerous for everyone else because when you contract space in front of you you literally crush everything between you and your star when you expand space behind you you you put incredible tension in everything around you you'd have to have an interstellar highway where you cleared out everything in between because otherwise you destroy basically everything around you our own technology is nowhere near sidestepping the laws of physics but an alien civilization that has evolved a million years ahead of us might already have found a way earth-bound physicists who are looking for life take this idea very seriously they have devised a system to categorize alien civilizations according to how advanced they may be when we physicists look in outer space we don't look for little green men we look for type 1 type 2 and type 3 civilizations a type 1 alien civilization would be so advanced it could harness all forms of energy on its planet including oceans volcanoes and even the weather would soon exhaust the power of a planet and use the energy of their local star at this stage they would be categorized as a type 2 civilization eventually they become galactic they begin to colonize entire star systems they begin to have fantastic energies allowing them to manipulate stars and black holes that is type three perhaps a hundred thousand to a million years more advanced than our technology but where would our own civilization be on this scale we don't even rate on this scale we get our energy from dead plants oil and coal that's how primitive we are our official rating is type zero we cannot travel across the vastness of interstellar space however a type three civilization would have developed the technology needed to control space and time in order to travel freely throughout the universe you cannot rule out the possibility that an extraterrestrial civilization perhaps a million years more advanced than ours have the capability of reaching the planet earth but any alien civilization developing ways of traveling across the galaxy to planet earth still faces potential disaster if they reach us at all then the oxygen in our atmosphere the very thing that keeps us alive may prove to be deadly poison for our alien visitors if an alien civilization has successfully learned how to control time and space and cross the interstellar void to visit earth they will face a serious danger our atmosphere it protects us from solar radiation but it's a dangerous barrier for any approaching spacecraft as an object approaches earth from space it heats up due to friction with molecules in our atmosphere the heat burns up most objects such as asteroids before they reach the ground nasa spacecraft use this friction to slow down as they re-enter the atmosphere heat resistant tiles protect them from the intense heat without them the ship would burn up but some physicists believe that a technologically advanced civilization would solve the problem long before they reach our atmosphere i would suspect that any intelligent creature with an advanced form of space travel would simply slow down even before it reaches the planet earth having navigated our atmosphere and landed safely on our planet the aliens faced their next big hurdle it's unlikely they could just step out of their craft earth's atmosphere would probably not match exactly the atmosphere on the home planet of a visiting alien in fact unless the aliens were adapted to oxygen they would find the gas extremely poisonous as aliens come to earth you wouldn't expect them to just walk out of their spacecraft and breathe the air and start eating apples and oranges here in the mojave desert in nevada nasa's space science division studies how earth's basic organisms live in extreme environments from this they hope to ascertain how different species might survive potentially hazardous conditions leading the research is dr chris mckay we take for granted that life needs oxygen and we all need it plants and animals need oxygen but we have developed very special machinery and enzymes for detoxifying oxygen oxygen is intrinsically poisonous but would evolution have happened in the same way on the home planet of an alien visitor would they have evolved to cope with oxygen in an extreme case the fundamental chemistry might be completely different with different gases dr mckay studies samples that contain over 10 million bacteria they reveal that some species here exist using totally different principles to the vast majority of life on earth if we look at the bacteria we get a glimpse of how strange chemistry really can be how these organisms can be really so so alien the strength of our sun poses another problem for visiting aliens the energy from its rays supports life on earth but it can be dangerous too much sun can blind humans burn us or even cause cancer for a creature from another planet our sun's rays could be deadly you can imagine life forms from another world coming here and finding the uv light here to be stunningly bright and require extensive sun shields and sunglasses and other ways to protect themselves and then there is earth's invisible hazard for aliens gravity a visitor from another planet might find earth's gravity a challenge humans have grown up with it in bodies designed for one g if we subject our own bodies to extreme gravity the consequences can be disastrous fighter pilots making extreme turns can experience forces as high as 9 g's that means that a 160 pound pilot feels like he weighs over 1500 pounds anything above 9 g's the pressure becomes too great and the pilot will black out aliens from a planet with less gravity would probably experience a similar effect say the martians came to earth well on mars the gravity is the third on earth the gravity would be higher for them so even if they were fit by martian standards they might find this high gravity of drag but it's not hard to postulate and have the technology to allow them to operate in higher gravity a far less predictable danger facing a visiting alien is germs just as in h.g wells's war of the worlds simple bacteria might be deadly to visiting aliens the bacteria on one planet could have serious consequences for organisms on another planet when the martians come they invade earth they kill off the armies of earth with no problem but then the bacteria on earth infect the martians and kill them in the end earth winds the war of the world but not because of the prowess of human technology but because of the biochemical diversity of the bacteria history has shown that there is good reason for visitors from another world to be cautious and for us to be cautious about them when the spanish invaded the americas they brought a far deadlier weapon than their guns and swords they brought smallpox the flu and other illnesses when those barriers were reduced and life spread between the new world and the old world there was a lot of death and destruction as a result of that we might contaminate visiting aliens or they might contaminate us this fear of infection from new species of bacteria also troubled nasa during the moon exploration of the 1960s they placed the first astronauts returning from the moon in quarantine in case they carry deadly space germs mckay hopes that an alien civilization exploring the universe would also be careful not to contaminate planets with their bugs one would imagine that an alien civilization with the technology to move between worlds would have the sense to realize the same problem and have strict biological barriers and controls they wouldn't just land and go out for a picnic and spread out their stuff on another world it's clear that the occupants of an alien spacecraft traveling to earth would face a catalog of dangers first they would have to survive the destructive forces within a wormhole then avoid burning up in the earth's atmosphere and finally protect themselves from poisonous oxygen or deadly germs perhaps alien visitors would decide not to take the risk themselves what if they send explorers who never age and who never die from deadly diseases the most efficient way is with robots these are self-replicating nanobots nanobots are miniature robots minute and lightweight enough to be potentially invaluable in space travel one of the major factors in traveling fast through space is weight the smaller you are the faster you can go in fact subatomic particles can travel at near the speed of light so tiny nanobots may be the best way of exploring the universe scientists believe that it might be possible to create microscopic nanobots able to clone themselves these would land on moons and planets and self-replicate allowing an alien civilization to explore vast tracts of the galaxy without ever leaving their home planet eventually you would have a sphere of perhaps trillions of robots expanding near the speed of light landing on moons each robot creating other robots that's the most scientifically reasonable way to explore the galaxy that's how nature does it that's how viruses work humans are already exploring the cosmos using robots nasa's voyager probes are heading deep into space sending back data as they go and robotic rovers have explored the surface of other planets in our solar system but because of their size it appears that nanobots could be the most logical way to explore the universe but so far there is no evidence that alien nanobots have ever visited earth and even if they have will we be able to detect them the vast majority of people who claim to have had close encounters in fact describe not miniature robots but living alien creatures often none too friendly and prone to abducting probing and experimenting upon their victims an advanced alien civilization might be able to manipulate physics and cross time in space to visit earth but some scientists question why on earth would they want to they suggest that beings capable of traveling through space and time would be millions of years more advanced than humans and would find life on earth of little interest and even if they do want to make contact they might not be friendly based upon the human race's own history of confrontation michael shermer publisher of skeptic magazine has his own theory if you go by what happens here on earth we would never want to come into contact with e.t we would be eaten or enslaved or killed because that's what happens here so that's not good even so some people claim to have already had a close encounter with extraterrestrials some even claim to have been abducted by them the alien abduction experience is a fascinating one these stories have all the earmarks of a very human kind of experience it's a type of night terror it's a bad dream because there is no evidence outlandish accounts of alien visitation are greeted with disbelief so most claimants are keen to conceal their identity one woman from new york who we have named molly claims to have experienced repeated visitations throughout her life probably the most strangest and disturbing memory that i have is of a dream with a white paw coming into my neck and placing a tiny little stick in it and when i woke up that morning i was very shocked to find a strange painful lump on my neck and when i felt it because i thought it was a pimple i discovered something hard in there the shape of a piece of rice according to molly the tiny implant worked its way deep into her body and before she could get medical advice it disappeared without a trace another encounter that she vividly remembers actually involved being taken on board an alien spacecraft i recall being in i'm going to call it a clam shell but it was more like a scallop and it had a top and a bottom and i can recall being inside of it and the top closed over you i experience medical procedures with very strange types of devices one of the beings was very tall and very thin and very insect-like like most people who claim to have met aliens molly has no evidence at all to back up her story and skeptics consider that experiences like hers are more to do with popular culture than extraterrestrials most people just give the default explanation that comes to mind which is whatever they've been seeing on television and reading in popular magazines and books over hundreds of years the phenomenon of visitations has manifested itself in a variety of guises in the middle ages people reported stories of angels and demons while a hundred years ago reports spoke of spirits and ghosts many scientists including shermer believe that a combination of sci-fi stories movies and real-life exploration of space encourages people to manifest their fears in the form of alien visitations the aliens are our angels they are our demons that that's who we personify as these weird anomalies we call them aliens because that's what we're into we're in the space age in the age of science fiction however that does not completely explain what causes people to believe they have experienced a visitation dr michael persinger from laurentian university in canada believes he has discovered a link between the alien visitation sensation and electromagnetic fields he suggests that fluctuations in electromagnetic activity could stimulate a reaction in the brains of certain individuals and account for most alien visitation experiences the experience of a presence occurring usually late at night and either producing a mystical experience or a sexual experience or even a terrifying experience shows up in all cultures and we now realize that this sensed presence is built into the human brain itself persinger believes that it is possible to induce something like an alien visitation experience in almost anyone he does this by creating a complex electromagnetic field in his laboratory and applying it to people's brains to demonstrate persinger and his assistant place a volunteer inside a soundproof chamber electrodes producing the magnetic field are attached to the subject's head then he is blindfolded and the lights are dimmed persinger monitors his stats and waits for his subject to experience a feeling similar to that of an alien presence with the experiences if you wish to report them aloud go right ahead within minutes the electromagnetic fields trigger a shocking reaction in the subject's brain how he describes it it's going to be a function of his culture his experiences and his experiences a lot feels like i'm dying at this point persinger stops the experiment in this study the subject is visualizing the presence in a terrifying way i have never had any feeling that ever it just made me feel a little trapped and it hurt i don't know closest i've ever been to hell it just it was an awful place to be the volunteer was extremely sensitive to the electromagnetic fields which stimulated his brain however this technique demonstrates the extraordinary power of our brain to turn our fears into monsters and demons and even aliens from distant worlds dozens of people have had experiences that they attributed to alien abductions and experiences we put them to the chamber they have a very similar experience the terrifying experiences induced in the chamber are caused by channeled electromagnetic fields persinger believes that abduction experiences in the real world are caused by electromagnetic fields created by natural phenomena such as sun flares seismic activity and changes in atmospheric conditions and it's thought that our common physiology and global culture is responsible for the similarity in the accounts inevitably we're all going to have similar experiences because our brains are wired that way we'll see the same kinds of illusions we'll have the same kinds of hallucinations and so on the role of electromagnetism in alien experiences is far from proven some researchers suggest that sleep paralysis or conditions like post-traumatic stress are to blame but until we've made contact with et we may never know if aliens are all in the mind or not and if e.t did reveal itself there could be another barrier to overcome language it may be that aliens don't choose to talk with us at all they may decide to talk to one of the other species that inhabits the earth and that could be whichever species they consider possesses the most intelligent language it may be possible for aliens to cross the interstellar void to land on earth and to adjust for survival in our atmosphere but communicating with us in any meaningful way may prove to be the hardest step of all we are arrogant to believe that they're going to want to actually talk to us and and visit us i mean why think of ants in an ant hill if someone is building a five-lane super highway right next to the anthill would the ants know how to communicate with the workers the main danger is that these workers will simply pave over the anthill and not even realize what they've done in san francisco a few scientists are already studying ways of communicating should e.t ever come to call leading the hunt is seti the search for extraterrestrial intelligence for the last 40 years seti scientists have been monitoring the skies listening for messages from alien species seti is just about every field you can imagine applied to the search for life in the universe seti scientist lawrence doyle believes that the key to communicating with aliens is first to understand their level of intelligence and for that he needs to establish how organisms communicate there hasn't been a search for extraterrestrial intelligence yet there's only been a search for extraterrestrial technology we plan to make it a search for intelligence by understanding the laws that create communication so that if we get signals we can tell it's a communication as opposed to random astrophysical processes by understanding the laws that dictate communication doyle can identify and separate real patterns of communication from random noise to do this he uses a mathematical equation known as information theory which was originally developed to quantify the amount of information sent down telephone lines doyle uses it to analyze the complexity of a language he calculates the interdependency of different words or sounds within the language the greater the number of words or sounds that can be strung together that are dependent on the first word or sound in the sequence the more complex the language on this scale english is a level 9 communication system doyle now plans to use the same technique on alien communication and the higher the complexity the more superior the intelligence any alien or extraterrestrial message has to obey the rules of information theory there's no other way to transmit information and if we can measure how complex their communication is it may be an indicator of how complex an extraterrestrial society is but information theory can only help doyle understand the complexity of an alien signal not the content so even if he spots e.t he won't know what e.t is saying it's the same problem we have on earth when humans try and communicate to other species if you smile at a wolf it does not mean i'm happy it means you want to pick a fight if you smile at chimpanzee it means you're scared so even a smile doesn't work how do you communicate with an alien is a tricky point we can't even agree on the same symbols of greeting among species on earth doyle has been using information theory to discern patterns and rules in animal communication and study their complexity the results have been surprising with his current data doyle has found that squirrel monkeys have a level three communication system while dolphins have a level four so who does doyle think might be the best candidates to communicate with aliens so far he's not convinced that either dolphins or humans have the necessary linguistic skills but he has found a species on earth with a communication level much much higher humpback whales we're majoring in because they look like they will have the absolutely most complex communication system maybe on the planet doyle's study of humpbacks is in its early stages and so far he has only studied their social calls but it may be that when extraterrestrials talk to the earth species with the most intelligent language they won't talk with us they'll talk to humpback whales instead but despite listening to the universe for four decades seti has yet to discover a single confirmed extraterrestrial signal to actually find real aliens we may need to look in a different place a place closer to home perhaps we should take a closer look at ourselves when you look in the mirror perhaps you are looking at a martian it's always amusing to me when i hear people talking about ufos and aliens but for me it's the bacteria there could be bacteria here that are really alien life on earth could have come from mars and we could all be aliens here mckay and other scientists believe there's a chance that billions of years ago alien bacteria were blasted from the surface of another planet and carried away in a meteorite the meteorite might have eventually crash-landed on earth spilling out the bacteria allowing it to grow and flourish it's a process called panspermia if panspermia is true you and i are aliens in the sense that our life did not develop on the planet that we're living now professor jay milosh of the university of arizona has studied meteorites that have landed on earth to see if they could have transported life from other worlds this meteorite is a piece of martian basalt where it came from was a large meteorite impact on the surface of mars it's almost an ideal delivery mechanism it's ideal because the rock protects the bacteria from radiation and extreme temperatures in space it would also protect it from the impact of crash landing on earth to test whether bacteria could travel safely through the cosmos malach and his colleague wayne nicholson conduct an extreme survival experiment they inject a large block of rock with bacteria and take the sample to the ames vertical gun laboratory near san francisco the blocks placed inside a large vacuum chamber ready and milosh then fires a projectile into it at over 13 000 miles per hour it absolutely destroyed the rock target blasted into tiny fragments amazingly despite the rock being virtually vaporized the bacteria survive intact if they could survive it's not a big stretch to think that organisms on the surface of another planet could also survive meteorite impact and launch into interplanetary space the experiment shows that bacteria could not only survive the vacuum of space but also the impact of landing on earth one theory is that bacteria from another world evolved over millions of years to form life as we know it so perhaps all life on our planet is alien in origin we human beings life plants animals everything we see descended from that common martian ancestor that's a possibility we may go to mars and suddenly see well that's where great great great grandma lived because of the vast size of our galaxy aliens even highly advanced ones may never have visited earth in spaceships all ufo sightings may well be no more than a simple misinterpretation of what we are seeing and alien visitations a product of our overactive imaginations but aliens might have been here all along we and all the species on our world could be the direct descendants of extraterrestrial life forms in the strangest twist of all perhaps we are the aliens you
moonlanding,"When you look up at a full moon, just remember that somewhere on the lunar face, the remains of Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 17 along with 8 unmanned Russian Luna missions and 5 pre-Apollo unmanned American Surveyor missions are all still there….. silently looking back….. unless of course, you’re a NASA non-believer.

so… why can’t we see these from the earth, why can’t we train our best telescopes on to the moon’s surface and see them there exactly where we left them the best part of 50 years ago.
Well, there a bit of a problem…. and that is that the moon is 384,000 kilometres or 238,000 miles away and the landers and all the other things left behind are just few meters across. 
To give you an Idea how difficult a problems that it is….. it’s like  looking for an object the size of a coin from 1000 miles away or the equivalent from New York to  Florida…. so you going to need a pretty serious telescope.

One telescope that springs to mind is the Hubble space telescope, after all if it can see galaxy’s billons of light years away then it should be able to see the Apollo landers easily…. shouldn’t it ??
Well, as with many things to do with space it’s not that simple.  Yes, the Hubble space telescope was indeed designed to look at very faint objects at astronomical distances but those objects are clusters of galaxy’s trillions of millions across, it was not designed the take high resolution images of small objects at fairly close ranges in astronomical terms like to the moon.
The problem is down to the resolution of the images that the telescope can produce and that is limited by the laws of physics. The resolution determines the size the smallest Picture Element is or pixel in the image. The higher the resolution more of the fine detail in an image can be seen. 
In a telescope, the bigger the mirror, the more the magnification, so the closer the object will appear but at the very large magnifications the image is also affected by the wavelength of the light itself. The shorter the wavelength like ultraviolet light, the finer the detail that can be captured and the resolution increases but in visible light as we go from blue through green to red,  the wavelength increases and the resolution is decreased. 
The Hubble has a mirror which is 2.4 meters in diameter, that was the largest that could fit in to the Space Shuttle when it was placed in to orbit. This gives it a single pixel resolution in ultra violet light of about 43 meters across on the moon’s surface, anything smaller than 43 meters across will just be hidden in a single dot which cannot be resolved any further, in fact we need really 2 pixels or more to make out anything at all......

So why can't we see these from Earth, why can't we train our best telescopes on to the moon's surface and see them exactly where we left them the best part of 50 years ago. Well there's a bit of a problem and that is that the moon is 384,000 kilometers or 238,000 miles away and the Landers and all the things that behind are just a few meters across. To give you an idea of just how difficult this problem is it's like looking for an object size of a coin from a thousand miles away or the equivalent from New York to Florida, so you need a pretty serious telescope. One telescope which springs to mind is the Hubble Space Telescope, after all if it can see galaxies billions of light-years away then it should be able to see the Apollo landings easily.... shouldn't it. Well as with many things to do with space is not that simple. Yes, the hubble space telescope was indeed designed to look at very faint objects at astronomical distances but those objects are clusters of galaxies trillions of miles across, it was just not designed to take high-resolution images of small objects are fairly close ranges in astronomical terms like to the moon. The problem is down through a resolution of the images at the telescope produce and that is ultimately limited by the law of physics. The resolution determines the smallest picture element or pixel in the image the higher resolution the more the fine detail image can be seen. In a telescope the bigger the mirror the more of a magnification so the closer the object will appear but very large magnifications be images also affected by the wavelength of light itself shorter the wavelength of light like ultraviolet light a fine of a detail that can be captured and the resolution increases but invisible light as we go from blue to green to red, the wavelength increases and a resolution is actually decreased. The Hubble has a mirror which is 2.4 meters in diameter which was the largest that will fit into space shuttle by when it was placed in orbit. This gives it a single pixel resolution in ultraviolet light of about 43 meters across on the moon surface, anything smaller than 43 meters will just be hidden in a single dot which cannot resolve any further. In fact we need really two pixels or more to make out anything at all. In visible light it's even worse and the size of the area covered by a single pixel increases 90 meters. The only way we're going to see any object few meters across on the lunar surface is either to increase the size of a mirror or get closer to the object we're looking at. Back on earth the current largest optical telescope in the world is the GTC on the Canary Islands with a mirror diameter of 10.4 meters. This increases the resolution so that the smallest area covered by one pixel will be 20 meters across invisible light still too big to see the Apollo lander which is just over 4 meters across. In fact to see the Apollo landers from Earth you need a telescope with a mirror size 10 times that of GTC or about 100 meters across and that does not yet exist. Even with a 100 meter telescope would only give you a two meter resolution coverage so the lander would be two pixels in visible light and four pixels in ultraviolet light, still not enough to discern any real detail. This is the reason why we are unable to see any of the vehicles on the moon from the earth and although in theory it is possible to use a group of telescope in an array to get a higher resolution, no one has yet done it because telescope time is in very high demand and very limited and looking for objects that we know already exists is just not a high enough priority just to disprove that none believers. What we need to do is put a camera in orbit around the moon just like the spy satellites or the ones which gives the satellite mapping services like Google Earth for example. In 2009 that's exactly what happened when the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter or LRO was launched to photograph and survey the moon from a distance between 12 and 100 miles above its surface. Even with a much smaller camera lens, at its closest passes, it has a resolution of just 0.5 meters or 18 inches per pixel. So now all of the Apollo sites with the lunar landers, the rover's as well as the russian site can now be seen for the first time since they landed. This also shows the trails left in the lunar dust by the astronauts both on foot and in the lunar Rovers, the science experiments that were left there over 44 years ago are still visible and even the shadows of the American flags can be seen as they vary in size due to the changing position of the Sun during lunar. Day we can't see the flags themselves because they are hanging vertically and the camera is looking for top down position and the flags for just a fraction of an inch thick. So now we have the photographic evidence of the Apollo landers, unless of course you don't believe anything official that comes out of NASA and that they were placed there by robotic Landers or aliens years later or the moon is a hologram and the earth is flat.

 orbit back in April 1990, it has sent back a ton of incredible photos. Each has its own story,
 but one of Hubble’s greatest images is this one, from 1995. This is a snapshot of nearly the entire history
 of the universe - and the first of its kind. The Hubble Deep Field is an unusual image
 that came from an unusual process. Typically astronomers apply to use Hubble
 to look at a particular known object. “You want to study a star? Okay you know what star you’re going to
 study. You point the telescope at that star.” That’s Robert Williams. He became the director of the telescope in
 1993. It was his decision to create the Deep Field
 image by pointing the telescope at nothing in particular. “What we're doing basically was just the
 opposite — we're trying to find a sort of indiscriminate area of sky where no observation
 had been made before.” They wanted to test how well Hubble could
 survey very distant galaxies. But they didn’t know what they’d see. And It wasn’t a great time to be trying
 new things. “After spending 2 billion dollars for 12
 years, to have this kind of unexpected, very large mistake take place..” The Hubble team was still repairing the reputation
 of the telescope after a flaw in the main mirror produced blurry images for nearly three years. “We were the brunt of jokes and the newspapers,
 political cartoons you know Johnny Carson show. NASA was being made fun of
 for having made such a monumental screw up of such an expensive project.” NASA sent astronauts on a 5-day mission to
 install a module that would fix the problem. And it worked. So Williams’ team spent 1995 planning the
 deep field observation. For one thing, they had to decide where to
 point the telescope. The goal was to see far beyond our galaxy,
 so the spot needed to be away from the galactic plane of the Milky Way and away from any known
 large galaxy clusters. They didn’t want anything bright to block
 the view. And to get continuous observations,
 it needed to be a location that wouldn’t be obscured when Hubble went around Earth,
 as it does every hour and a half or so. They settled on a region just above the big
 dipper -- a dark, unremarkable, peephole into the universe. The field of view was extremely narrow. Astronomers measure the apparent size of objects
 in the sky in angular degrees, and a degree can be divided into 60 arcminutes. From Earth, the moon is about half a degree
 across, around 30 arcminutes. But the area that Hubble photographed was
 just 2.6 arcminutes across. “A little larger than a pinhead at arm's
 length. So it’s a teeny patch of sky.” The observations began on December, 18, 1995,
 collecting 4 different wavelengths of light. And over the next 10 days the telescope took
 342 images of that teeny patch of sky. “We were relieved that we are getting good
 data but we had to keep adding it up and so it wasn't until ten days that we realized oh, we really got something.” There are a few nearby stars in the image
 but pretty much all the other objects here, including these tiny blue dots -- they’re galaxies. The light from these different galaxies has
 been traveling for vastly different amounts of time so the furthest galaxies are shown
 pretty early in their evolution, more than 12 billion years ago. That’s just a billion and a half years after
 the big bang. It’s as if you could point a telescope across
 the earth and actually photograph ancient Egypt, with a neanderthal in the background
 and then further back there’s a dinosaur. The research team sampled another tiny spot
 two years later, this time in the southern sky. “We wanted to know okay then we got one
 spot of this you never know maybe it was some weird spot and so we thought it was important
 to repeat the observation.” The datasets boosted estimates of the total
 number of galaxies. They allowed researchers to track the history
 of star formation through the universe. And they helped confirm the bottom-up theory
 of galaxy formation, by revealing galaxies that are small and irregular early in their
 evolution. But one of the most important legacies of
 the Hubble Deep Field is how it changed the culture of astronomy. “Until this time astronomy had a history
 of people taking the data and keeping it to themselves until they had fully analyzed it
 after all this was intellectual property.” Instead of hoarding the discoveries embedded
 in the dataset, Williams and his team formatted and released it immediately to the wider scientific
 community. It’s been cited in hundreds of papers. “Nowadays it is so much more common for
 people to take interesting observations and make the data available to the public even
 though they might have a right to keep it for a certain period of time to themselves.” Thanks to servicing missions that installed
 more advanced cameras, Hubble has since made even deeper deep field images, and those data
 too, were released to the public. “I think it it moves forward the march of
 human understanding human knowledge tremendously and the Hubble deep field did that.”"

at these two teams we're talking about here even though the transition was in effect come around 2000 2001 and what have you it was still a different game compared to what is being played today we know what they would do to Steph Curry in today's generation they would look at Steph Curry they would look at Kevin Durant back in 2000 and please don't get me wrong max they would be all-star caliber players but do you know the kind of physical abuse they would have had to absorb they would have looked at Kevin Durant and that skinny frame because remember there was still an Iceman George Gervin so we know he still would have got his but they would have looked at him they would have looked at a Steph Curry you know they would have done their to beat him up then I ran him through picks there to make sure they felt elbows all the time all of those different things so I think in that era because of the marksmanship of Steph Curry and Kevin Durant max I can't submit early dismiss that I know there's no way in hell those Lakers would have beaten these Golden State Warriors in today's game no way in hell absolutely not but back then I would say oh it's up for grabs and if it were the 90s I would definitely go with the Lakers team instead of this Golden State Warriors team because they simply wouldn't be physically tough enough to deal with the style of play that took place in the 80s and 90s and to a lesser degree 2000 so I don't think anybody's wrong here it just they get visions need to answer the question more directly max as to whatever are we talking about is it now or is it then max your side are you on well um I see this the opposite of Stephen a though largely the same ready for this DNA says neither I say both there is truth in what both are speaking right but and I disagree with you Stephen I know what you mean by this the error would affect the style of play and therefore affect the score of the game but I don't know if it actually affects the winner I don't know any players yeah I understand it the play yeah I believe in any error that they played if you simply pluck these teams out and put them down on a court the Warriors who beat those Lakers because the reason the game has played the way it is today is not just rules changes it's that through analytics and through perience people realized and through common sense I mean by the way Rick Pitino was the first guy to do this with the Knicks with the bomb squad if you shoot a lot of threes you're counting by three instead of one or two you know it's it's it's better don't take long tubes they really didn't know that and play that way back then so this warrior style I believe would translate successfully even if with more bumps and bruises in any era but I don't think that's how you can really do it if you pluck that Lakers team out of 2000 2001 and drop them today in the preseason any GM would look and say we need a few more shooters or Kobe Bryant had he been coming up today would be a far better three-point shooter because he'd have to take a lot more of them so it's not exactly so therefore when I look at what Shaq says I understand what he means the gist of it what Shaq is saying is look yeah they got more all-stars than we had but we had the number one and number two player in their primes in the game at the same time that's not Stefan KD Kobe and Shaq are higher in their era into you want to throw Tim Duncan in there say two of the three best fine but I could throw a whole bunch of guys in the mix with Stefan KD well and so Shaq is saying the way we dominated in our time in that one season the Warriors have not yet done and I understand his point well listen I understand this point but at the same time he was a liability at the free-throw line obviously so not only are you talking about a two-point score were you talking about a one-point score some of the time because you just hack-a-shaq found them send it to the free-throw line and Bank on him missing one of the two free-throws so if you wanted to make an argument on behalf of the Golden State Warriors at because of that particular reality I get that I guess what I'm thinking of I'm thinking of errors in here's what I'm talking about I'm talking about a style of play from the standpoint max you were allowed to hurt guys you were allowed to run them through picks and screens and whatever and we see how fragile Steph Curry is at times he's gotten stronger he's gotten better but still relatively fragile I'm amazed at the absence of injuries Kevin Durant has incurred in his career I expected him to be more injury prone than he's ever been so I give him a lot of for that as well but let's take for example max let's just say this forget you look at every right let's say Jordan you know why I say what the Jordan Jordan would have defended one of them Pippen would have defended somebody and Dennis Rodman woulda defended draymond Green you see what I'm saying yeah so when we look at it from a personnel perspective there's no question that I would have picked those guys over the goals I agree errors do matter but let me say no matter let me say this in terms of matchups how would you exploit Golden State a big body in the low post maybe in the history of the game who would you choose over Shaq there that's a problem for Golden State as is Shaq in the pink because no matter how much the game has changed you still need to get to the paint it's not post ups anymore it's dribble penetration but you still need to get to the paint or else you really are just a jump shooting team let me also give Mark Jackson credit Stephen a the reason I believe you're wrong about Steph he may have been gotten his lumps and stuff but he be an MVP caliber more or less player in any era yeah it's because Mark Jackson and Steph Curry with Steph Curry had the imagination to say I don't care you're not supposed to shoot from way back there I can do that and Mark Jackson said yes you can I'm your coach and I'm telling you you can do that I believe that you can do that and that changed the game it's not just that he shoots threes City shoots you know 100 footers three give them extra space from the part he could do that in any era is gonna stop them from doing that but listen I'm certainly not trying to take credit away from Mark Jackson because he had a lot of doing we talked about Jerry West when we talked about Bob Meyers when we talked about owner Joe Lake up you know these are guys I love let's not forget the fact that Mark Jackson was there it helped build that foundation and deserves a lot of credit and even Steve Kerr recognized that even though he made some modifications particularly on the offensive side of the floor with Iguodala but nevertheless when it comes down to is this anybody saw that comment from Steph Curry coming straight out of Davidson D'Antoni with the New York Knicks do you think he wasn't gonna let step pull up from the parking lot of course he was of course he was he just did just had to go to state warriors had a pic before the Knicks which is what makes me sick to my stomach but his day I wouldn't say anyone would it would take a certain kind of coach it takes a special whatever to have you guys that would have look once upon a time you were not supposed to swing for the fences Babe Ruth said to hell with that that's why he was Babe Ruth Steph Curry said I don't care what they've done till now I'm gonna shoot from the parking lot I can make that shot and it would take a special coach to say that's fine you see and you see the brother making shots from the pocket and what it ain't hard to change your mind we re different game different era

Raumfahrzueg Mix 03: https://soundcloud.com/synchro505/raumfahrzueg-mix-03",How did NASA get those great film shots of Apollo and the Shuttle?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlPfHV36G-g,-1,907318,19019,555,2215,BlPfHV36G-g,"These are some of the iconic pieces of
 launch footage from the space race and the shuttle program, shots taken that would
 be impossible for any human to see close up and personal and many of them were
 done long before we had miniature high-definition cameras and high-speed
 data links beaming the footage live from space so how did NASA film these
 incredible shots of Apollo the space shuttle and beyond. Now as good as these
 look from an aesthetic point of view they weren't done just to wow the public,
 they had a very important engineering role and that was their primary purpose
 to show the engineers and scientists just what was going on at critical
 stages of the launch and in some cases like the shuttle Challenger and Columbia
 disasters they were key in finding out exactly what happened. The story of how
 these techniques were developed goes back to the very first long-range
 ballistic missile the V2, the world's first CCTV system was developed by
 Walter bruch in order to observe the rocket launches from a safe distance in
 a bunker. At the time there was no way to record the video footage, so cameraman
 had to stand within the walled test area to film the launches, an extremely
 dangerous place to be so close to prototype rockets. Major General dr.
 Walter Dornberger, the V2 project leader recalled how on one V2 test the rocket
 launched but then stalled and hovered about four metres above the launch table,
 something that normally preceded it falling back in exploding. About a
 hundred meters from the rocket and next of a test area earth wall a cameraman
 was filming it with a hand-cranked camera. After about five seconds the
 rocket started to rise as its fuel was depleted and it became lighter, it
 gradually rose up remaining vertical and slowly travelling sideways towards the
 cameraman who continued filming till it passed almost directly overhead at which
 point he then stopped filming and ducked down, the rocket exploded a split second
 later and crashed about 40 meters beyond the 
 test area wall a remarkable feat of bravery on behalf of a cameraman who
 survived unscathed. When the U.S. took the surviving stock of around a hundred
 V2's to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico after the war they needed
 a way to observe and record their test fights in greater detail and safety than
 was done before. In 1946 Clyde Tombaugh, the astronomer who first discovered
 Pluto 16 years earlier was invited to come to White Sands to help improving
 optical instruments tracking of the Rockets. Tombaugh's team built their
 tracking system on a world war 2 M/45 quad mount anti-aircraft platform
 affectionately known as ""little bright eyes"" this was because of a binoculars
 the operator used to manually guide the field of view along the flight path
 which were fitted between the five and six inch reflector telescopes attached
 to two 35mm cameras which had replaced the 50 calibre guns.
 But it wasn't only ground cameras that were of importance. In 1946 Clyde Holliday
 an engineer working on the V2 program modified a 35 mm movie camera to
 withstand the shock of the launch and the impact when it came back to earth. On
 October 24th 1946 the camera which used Eastman Kodak Super XX film running at 4
 frames per second was mounted into an aluminium case with ten millimeter thick
 walls and into the body of a V2 rocket and then launched to a height of a
 107 kilometers. This was the first time that anyone had seen the
 earth from the edge of space. From here they could clearly say 1,200 kilometers
 in all directions in area the equivalent of 4.1 million square kilometers and
 they could clearly see the curvature of the earth. The M-45 platform was used on
 three further tracking mounts at the White Sands range and some of the T4
 systems are still in use today. But as America went from testing small
 ballistic missiles of a mighty Saturn V, a huge array of different cameras became
 necessary to check the complex systems during launch. At the
 John F Kennedy Space Center in Florida a concrete launchpad at complex 39a was
 riddled with fixed high-speed cameras able to record on for 16mm film
 at 500 frames per second. By the time of Apollo 11 there were 201 cameras recording the launch 119  for engineering and 82 for documentary purposes. This footage is from camera E8
 which was housed within the concrete pad itself out of line of sight of the
 engines and pointed at a heat-resistant mirror made of quartz glass to avoid
 being destroyed at liftoff. Above the pad similar high frame rate cameras on
 gantry's film the Rockets clean separation from the umbilical
 connections as for Saturn V cleared the tower. The ascent was broadcast to a live
 TV audience worldwide from a camera on a mount descended from Tombaugh's bright
 eyes. From the mid-1960s purpose-built tracking mounts were made by companies
 like Photo Sonic's,  their cine-sextant optical tracking mount held twin
 telescopes on powerful motorized pedestals allowing heavier optics to
 track the launch at greater ranges. This footage from Apollo 4 shows the first
 stage separation and height of 65 kilometers, 211,000 feet and was captured by a camera on the ground but even with
 powerful telescopes like this they couldn't see the detail of what was
 happening in the rocket itself. To see this cameras were fitted into the Saturn
 rocket stages to film a stage separations. In fact the now iconic
 separation footage seen here was from cameras mounted in the base of the
 second stage and is often shown as part of Apollo 11 footage but he's actually
 from Apollo 4.  These cameras weren't used on Apollo 11 due to lack of space available. Apollo 4 was the first unmanned test of a full
 Saturn V rocket and many things still remained unknown about how it would
 react during the launch. The engineers wanted to see that the
 stages separated cleanly and that the interstage structures, that's the
 smaller ring like object here, didn't hit the engines during separation as the
 clearances were very tight. The J2 engines seen in the top of the frame are
 firing although the hot exhaust plume is invisible in the vacuum of space but its
 effects can be seen on the interstage section as it falls away. On Apollo 6
 there were six film cameras and two TV cameras. The film cameras ran out a
 100 frames per second and were fitted into pods that were ejected from
 the stage shortly after separation as you can see here. These would fall back
 to earth and once they were in the lower atmosphere they would inflate para-balloons to Slow landing into the sea and allow them to float. There was also a
 radio beacon which was activated and allowed them to be found in the Atlantic
 Ocean normally around about 600 miles downrange but not all the pods were
 recovered. On Apollo 6 only two of the six were found and in 1964 on mission SA-7 they ended up being ejected into hurricane Gladys as it made its way
 across Atlantic. However several weeks later two of them were washed up
 undamaged on the islands of San Salvador and Eleuthera. Whilst some of the cameras
 filmed the subject directly others were the first to use fiber optics to
 remotely place the lenses away from the actual cameras to film places that will
 be otherwise inaccessible, like this the inside of the fuel tanks to see how the
 fuel reacted in low gravity and how much it sloshed around during the launch,
 something that could seriously affect the Rockets guidance if it was not
 controlled. A decade later the tracking mounts again
 had to catch up with a broadcast of the first flight of the American space
 shuttle Columbia. When the shuttle launched on the 12th of April 1981 the
 stakes were high, to broadcast the launch to a TV audience who were now more than
 ever watching in full color. A government contract was awarded to the private
 company Contraves to deliver a new mobile optical
 platform which they called the Kineto Tracking mount or KTM. Like the photo
 sonic platform these retained the recognizable format of the M-45 mount
 however they could either be manned or set up for remote operation within the
 launch exclusion zone. Although the new robotic mounts were greeted with
 suspicion by the camera operators at the Kennedy Space Center, 10 mobile KTMs were positioned around the launch center. short-range optics on these mounts film
 from T-10 seconds to T+57 seconds with longer range optics
 capturing until T+165 seconds. This piece of footage here of the shuttle
 discovery at T+40 seconds is shot from a medium distance camera about 3.8
 kilometers from the launch pad using a 150 inch lens with a 4,000mm focal length as the shuttle is accelerating through 20,000 feet. As
 discovery goes through a 145,000 feet at a hundred and 23 seconds into the flight, the Boosters separate which is captured
 here by another 150 inch 4000mm focal length lens on a KTM. The weight of
 the lens alone on these was about a 115kg and the
 tracking to keep the discovery in the frame was done by a human and not an
 automated system. After three minutes the job of filming the ascent was
 transferred to the largest telescope on the site the permanently mounted 24-inch
 aperture Recording Optical Tracking Instrument or ROTI. With a focal
 length of up to 12,700mm ROTI  had enough
 magnification to follow the launch for up to five minutes after liftoff. ROTI
 used both radar assisted tracking and a joystick for manual adjustment, which
 had such a fine sensitivity but it could register the heartbeat of the user if
 held to firmly. During the early shuttle launches over a 130 
 cameras were used to record all aspects of the launch combining 16mm, 35mm and 70mm  film formats as well as
 high-definition video. Film was used even after the advent of video because of its
 high resolution an actual wider dynamic range that's its ability to keep very
 bright and normally lit objects in the same scene without them being washed out.
 The video was used for quick access to footage whilst the film was being
 processed. The high speed film cameras were placed in explosion-proof boxes
 close to the launch pad to record different aspects of a flight. Here is
 camera E-19. It's running at 400 frames per second with a 10 mm wide
 angle lens and recording the engine startup and flame pattern. The cameras
 were fitted with automatic exposure control to allow them to film the
 exhaust plume that from the solid rocket boosters, which  looks as bright as the Sun. You can see how wide the dynamic range this gives and how well it works when
 combined with film as in this shot you have the super-bright SRB exhaust with
 the blue sky behind it and both are perfectly exposed. This shot is actually
 recording the operation of the explosive hold down bolts, four of which held down
 each of the SRBs to the mobile launch pad until the point of liftoff. Another
 great shot is that of a tail service mount disconnect from camera E-18 there
 was one of these on each side of a shuttle, one for the liquid hydrogen and
 one for the liquid oxygen. Again the 16mm camera used a 10 millimeter
 lens and was running at 400 frames per second as were most of the engineering
 cameras on the mobile launch pad. What's not easily apparent from this shot is
 the size of a connector. Each one was 1.2 meters wide by 1.8 meters high that's
 bigger than most house doors. They were pulled in with a force of 9,000
 kilograms before the protective blast doors dropped down. One of the biggest
 challenges was that once the door was shut it was pitch black inside so they
 had to be lit by tungsten but the vibration was so strong but it
 would blow the filaments in the lamps so on the latest missions LED lighting is
 now used instead. Cameras were also vital to the investigation of the Challenger
 and Columbia disasters. As the space shuttle Challenger rose into the sky on
 the icy morning of January 28th 1986 the high frame rate cameras on the launch
 tower filmed a puff of gray smoke escaping from the side of the right
 solid rocket booster but by the time the pictures were examined it was far too
 late. 17% of all Americans were watching
 including millions of schoolchildren as challenger broke up 73 seconds after
 launch broadcast live the footage of STS 51- L remains among the most
 unforgettable tragic for the space program. During the investigation of the
 disaster footage from NASA's tracking cameras was essential to identifying the
 sequence events during challengers last flight with the ROTI's high
 magnification the burst of superheated gas from the SRB can be seen and during
 the explosion the individual elements of the orbiter can be identified including
 the crew cabin which was designed to survive much greater pressures than the
 fuselage and was only destroyed on impact with the ocean surface below. Such
 tragic accidents led to wider use of cameras for each launch with a number of
 KTMs increasing to 14 following but Columbia Shuttle disaster in 2003 with
 the return to flight in 2005 STS-114 had over 400 cameras monitoring the launch
 on this launch rocket cam would be used for the second time this is a camera
 system that is fitted to the outside of the SRBs and the main fuel tank. At about
 127 seconds into the flight a large piece of debris about 92 centimeters by
 27 centimeters was caught by a rocket cam falling from the main fuel tank but
 luckily not hitting anything. 20 seconds later another smaller pace
 hit the right wing but after checking with the orbiter boom sensor system, it
 was found not to have caused any damage. Rocketcam is now used on most launches
 and is responsible for the amazing external footage of things like booster
 separations and the landing of the SpaceX reusable rockets. The return to
 flight also used high-definition cameras aboard the B-57 canberra aircraft at an
 altitude of 60,000 feet over 18 kilometers for WB 57 ascent video
 experiment was able to film a shuttle even in overcast weather tracking the
 launch over a 643 kilometre path into space. So what's your favourite piece of
 launch footage let me know in the comments below and maybe you're one of
 the amateur rocketry servers or one of the workers of the Kennedy Space Center
 it will be great to hear your views in the comments.

Speech,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLzBMGXfK4c,0,13919843,84825,3363,13602,XLzBMGXfK4c,"welcome to Michael he's one of his basketball role models the hall-of-famer known as Skywalker class of 1996 David Thompson ladies and gentlemen Michael Jordan thank you thank you I told all my friends I come up here and say thank you and walk off I can't there's no way I got so many people I can think in all the videos you never just saw me so scottie pippen every chance if I want I've had a lot of questions over the last four weeks and everybody's saying well why did you pick david thompson i know why david knows why and maybe you guys don't know why but as I grew up in North Carolina I was 11 years old 1974 I think when you guys won the championship and I was an anti Carolina guy hated UNC here I ended up at UNC but I was I was in love with David Thompson not just for the game of basketball but in terms of what he represented you know we all as Vivian say I said we go through our trials and tribulations and he did and I was inspired by him and when I called him and asked him to stand up for me I know I shocked the out of him I know I do but he was very very kind and said yeah I do it and now that wasn't disrespect or into my Carolina guys they all know them I'm true blue Carolina guy to the heart you know Coach Smith Larry Brown Sam Perkins James Worthy you know all of those guys well it all starts with my my parents you guys see all the highlights what is it what is it about me that you guys don't know as I set up in on watching all the other recipients stand up and they give their the history and so many things I didn't know about Jerry Sloan I know he lived on the farm but I didn't know he was in a you know small classroom with from first grade to the eighth grade even David Robinson obviously I've known David for some time and you know I found some some things out about him and even with John I found some bad things or good things about him and it even did if I know I'm dead for years and her and my father and my mom spent a lot of time on the nightkin trips and you know I found out a lot of good things about her but what about me that you guys don't know I got two brothers James and Larry they're five four or five five in heights they gave me all I could ever ask for as a brother in terms of competition you know you think that you know he's my brother Larry is a is ideal the situation with small things come in small packages this dude fought me every single day and to the extent that my mother used to come out and make us come in because we were fighting way too much and my older brother was always gone he served in the Army for 31 years and the competition didn't stop there my sister who's one year younger than me Rob never wanted to be home by herself she took classes extra classes to graduate from high school with me to go to University of North Carolina with me and to graduate fired than me and you guys didn't ask me where my competition or my competitive nature came from it came from them it came from my older sister she was not here today and my father he was not here today obviously he's with us in all of us I mean my competitive nature is gone a long way from the first time I picked up any sport baseball football ran track basketball anything to miss class I played it when you think about you know so they started to fire at me you know that fire started with my parents and then you know as I moved on in my career people added wood to that fire coach Smith and what else can I say about him you know he's a legendary and then there's Leroy Smith now you guys think that's a myth Leroy Smith was a guy when I got cut he made the team on the varsity team and he's here tonight he's still the same six seven guy he's not any bigger he's probably his game is about the same but he started the whole process for me because when he made the team and I didn't I wanted to prove not just to Leroy Smith not just to myself but to the coach who actually picked Leroy over me I want to make sure you understood you made a mistake dude and then there's Buzz Peterson my roommate now when I first met buzz all I heard about was this kid from Asheville North Carolina who's the Player of the Year I'm thinking well he never played against me yet so how did he become player of the year is that uh is that some type of media you know exposure and I came from Wilmington you know we had two channels channel ABC and channel 7 channel NBC that was it I never saw NBA sports at all when I grew up you didn't have CBS affiliate in North Carolina and Warmington so Buzz Peterson became a dot on my board and when I got the chance to meet Buzz Peterson on the basketball court playing the person buzz was a great person is it wasn't a fault of his it was just my competitive nature I didn't think he could beat me or he was better than me as a basketball player and he became my roommate and from that point on he became a focal point not knowingly he didn't know it but he did and coach Smith the day that he was on the Sports Illustrated and he named four starters and he didn't name me that burned me up because I thought I'd be long on that Sports Illustrated now he had his own vision about giving a freshman that exposure and I told you understand that but from a basketball sense I deserved to be on that Sports Illustrated and he understand and it didn't stop there you know my competitive nature went right into the pros I get to the Bulls which I was very proud that at the time Jerry Reynolds didn't on the team it was another organization and Rob thorn drafted me Kevin Locke he was my first coach Kevin used to take practices and put me in starting five and we you know he'd make it a competitive thing where the losing team have to run so now we are on the winning team and halfway in the game halfway in the situation he would switch me to the losing team so I take that as a competitive thing but you trying to test me and by nine times out of ten the second team would come back and win no matter what he did so I appreciate Kevin lock you for giving me that challenge you know providing that type of fire with him and he threw another log on that fire for me Jerry Reinsdorf I mean what else can I say the next year I come back I broke my foot I was out for 65 games and when I came back I want to play you know in the doctors that came up with this whole theory that you can only play seven minutes a game but I'm practicing two hours a day you know I'm saying well I don't think I don't know that I don't agree with that math you know and back then it was about whoever had the worst record get the most balls and the ping-pong balls and you know you can decide what pick you're gonna have but I didn't care about that I just wanted to win I wanted to make the playoffs you know I wanted to keep that energy going in Chicago so I had to go in his office and sit down with him I said Jerry you know I feel like I should play more than 14 minutes in practice in two hours he says MJ I think I have to protect me long-term of investment that we've invested in you that's the day I flew I really think I should be able to play he said let me ask you this you say if you had a headache and you know at that time it was about ten percent chance that I can reinjure my my ankle or my foot he says if you have a headache and you got a ten tablets and one of them is code it would sign I would you take the tylenol and I looked at him I said how bad is the headache depending on how bad the headache Gerry looked at me and so you okay I guess that's a good answer you can go back and play you let me allow to go back and fly and you know Gerry provided a lot of different obstacles for me but at the same time the guy gave me an opportunity to perform at the highest level in terms of basketball and the Bulls whole Bulls organization you know they did a great justice for me and for all my teammates believe me I had a lot of teammates over the 14 years that I played for the Bulls and you know I respected each and every one I'm I just wanted to win you know about how you look at it and then the loan came Doug Collins who was caught in the whole mix of this Jerry Krause and and Jerry Reinsdorf and you know at the same time he you know when I was trying to play in the summertime he said well you know you're part of the the organization or the organization said you can't play in the summertime I said Doug yet and read the fine print in my contract in my contract say I had to love the game clause that means I can play anytime I want anyplace I want and Doug looked at me and said yeah you're right you're right and that's how we became you know a little closer in terms of Doug Collins in myself and you know Jerry Krause is right there and Jerry's not here obviously I don't you know I don't know who invited him I didn't but uh I hope he understands I hope he understands it goes a long way and he was a very competitive person I was a very competitive person he said organization wins championships I said I didn't see organization playing with the flu in Utah I didn't see them playing with you know with the bad ankle granite granite I think organizations put together teens but at the end of the day the team's gotta go out and play you know so in essence I think the players win the championship and the organization has something to do with it don't get me wrong but don't try to put their organization above the players because at the end of the day the players still got to go out there and perform you guys got a pass but I still gotta go out and play obviously you see my kids you know Jeffrey Marcus jasmine I love you guys you guys represent a lot of me a lot of different personalities your mom you represent them as well you know I think that you guys have a heavy burden I wouldn't want to be you guys if I had to you know because of all the expectations that you have to deal with I mean look around you the charge $1,000 tickets for this thing for this whole event it used to be 200 bucks but I paid it you know I had no choice I had a lot of family a lot of friends I had to bring in so thank you all the frame for the for grazing ticket price I guess but you guys I love you guys you guys just don't know you got a whole host of people supporting you family friends people that you don't know relatives coming out of the Woodworks you know no matter how you look at it but I think we taught you right and your mom and I and I hopefully you can make the right decision when the time comes my mom what that's kind of see my mom my mom never stays still you think I'm busy she's always on the go and without her she's a rock she's unbelievable she's right now she takes over two job she's unbelievable woman I mean if I got anybody's nagging me each and every day it is her and she she constantly keeps me focus on the good things about life you know how people perceive you how you respect them you know what's good for the kids what's good for you you know how you perceive publicly second thought take a pause and think about you know things that you do and it all came from my parents you know came from my mom and she's still at this stage I'm 46 years old she's still parenting me today and that's a good thing about that lady I love her to death I love her to death and I'm gonna thank a couple people that you guys probably wouldn't even think that I would think Isiah Thomas Magic Johnson George Gervin now they say it was a so-called freeze out in my rookie season I wouldn't have never guessed but you guys gave me the motivation and say you know what everything I haven't proved enough to these guys I gotta prove to them that I deserve what I've gotten on this level and no matter what people may have said if it was a rumor I never took it as truth but you guys never froze me out because I was just happy to be there no matter how you look at it you know and from that point forward you know I wanted to prove to you magic Larry George everybody that I deserve to be on this love as much as anybody else and I hopefully over the period of my career I've done that without a doubt you know even in the Detroit years we've done that Pat Riley I mean you and I we go way back I still remember in our wife you remember in a wife with you and I I was coming in you would I guess leaving and you decided to stay a couple extra days but you were in my suite and they came and they told you you had to get out of my suite and you slit a note underneath my door although you had to move you did move this little note saying I enjoyed the competition congratulations but we will meet again and I take the heart in that because I think in all honesty you're just competitive as I am you know even from a coaching standpoint and you've challenged me every time I play the Knicks the heat and I don't think you with the Lakers but any time I played against you you had your Jordan Stoppers on your team yeah John Starks who I loved I even had my friend Charles Oakley saying we can't go to lunch we can't go to dinner because Pat doesn't believe in fraternizing between the two of us and this guy hit me harder than anybody else in the league and he was my best friend Patrick Ewing we had the same agent we came at the same time but we couldn't go to lunch why is this you think I'm a play against Patrick any different and I play against anybody else no no and then you had your little guy who was on your staff who became the Knicks coach after you Jeff Van Gundy he said I conned the players I befriended them and then I attack him on the basketball court where did that come from I just so happened to be a friendly guy I get along with everybody but at the same time the light comes on I'm competitive to anybody you know you know so you guys I must say thank you very much for giving me that motivation that I desperately needed Phil Jackson Phil Jackson is uh to me is that he's a professional Dean Smith you know he challenged me mentally not just physically you know he understood the game along with Tech's winner they taught me a lot about the basketball game text being the specialist you know I could never please text and I love text Texas not here but you know I know he's here in spirit he is I can remember a game coming off the basketball court and we were down I don't know five to ten points and I go off about twenty-five points we come back and win the game and we're walking off the floor and Tex look at me and said you know there's no I in team I said Tex a doc it's not a nineteen but it's I and win I think you got my message I'll do anything to win you know if that means we play team format we win that means I have to do whatever I have to do you're gonna win no matter how you look at it and then you had all your media and they says Oh scoring champion can't win it can't win in an NBA title oh well you know you just you know as good as Magic Johnson not as good as Larry Bird you're good but you're not as good as those guys you know I had to listen to all this and that puts so much wood on that fire that it kept me each and every day trying to get better as a basketball player now I'm not saying they they were wrong I may look at him from a different perspective you know but at the same time as a basketball player I'm trying to become the best that I can you know and for someone like me who achieved a lot in over the time of my career you look for any kind of messages that people may say or do to get you motivated to play the game of basketball at the highest level because that that is when I feel like I excel at my best and my last example of that and the last one that you guys probably have seen I hate to do it to him but he's such a nice guy and when I first met Bryon Russell John and John in college remember this I was in Chicago in 1994 we I was working out for baseball they were came down for a workout and shooting around I came over to say hello and at this time I had no thought to coming back and playing the game of basketball and Brian Russell came over to me and say you know what man why'd you quit why'd you quit you know I could guard you if I ever see you in a pair of shorts if I ever seen a very short you reminisce Johnny and so when I did decide to come back in 1995 and then we played Utah 96 I'm at the center circle and we and and Brian Russell sitting next to me and I look over to Brian sees nobody saw conversation you made in 1994 about when you I wish I think I can guard you I can shut you down I would love to play against you were you about to get your chance and believe me ever since that day he got his chance I don't know I'll succeed in these words but I think he had his chance and believe me I relished on that point and from this day forward if I ever see him in shorts I'm coming at it I know you guys got to go I know I've been up here a lot longer than I told my friends I was gonna be up here I cried I was supposed to get up and say thank you and walk off and I didn't even do that so I appreciate it thank you very much I appreciate it as I close the game of basketball has been everything to me my refuge my place I've always gone when I needed to find comfort and peace it's been a source of intense pain and source of most intense feelings of joy and satisfied satisfaction and one the norm you can imagine it's been a relationship that has evolved over time and it's given me the greatest respect and love for the game it's provided me with the platform to share my passion with millions in a way I neither expected nor could have imagined in my career I hope that it's given the Mane's of people that I've touched the optimism and the desire to achieve their goals through hard work perseverance and positive attitude although I'm recognized with this tremendous honor of being in the Basketball Hall of Fame I don't look at this moment as a defining end to my relationship with the game of basketball it's simply a continuation of something that I started a long time ago one day you might look up and see me playing the game at 50 oh don't laugh never say never because limits like fears are often just an illusion thank you very much you"

world now look into space to the moon and to the planets beyond on the 25th of May 1961 President John F Kennedy of the United States of America committed the resources of his nation and launched project Apollo the greatest technological undertaking in the history of mankind I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth this was the race to space working to beat the Russians the enthusiasm was absolutely tremendous people were absolutely glued to their televisions it was a transformative events in human history one-fifth of humanity watched Neil Armstrong's footsteps in 1969 but only two years later in 1972 public and political interest in Apollo had dwindled NASA was forced to cancel their last three missions making Apollo 17 man's final mission to the moon astronauts Eugene Cernan Harrison Schmitt and Ronald Evans were the three brave men chosen to fly NASA's final mission they have been written up in history books and acknowledged by the space and scientific communities but have never received the public recognition they truly deserved yet Apollo 17s voyage to the moon was the crowning glory of man's lunar exploration paolo 17 broke so many records the crew spent three days on the lunar surface their moon walks lasted eight hours they covered a greater distance than any other mission the scientific legacy about where 17 has been enormous Caterpie 17 not happened when indeed I shudder to think really what textbooks would have to say even now about the early history of the solar system 17 did mark the end of an era since then we haven't traveled into space as far a Poli 17 is the hidden jewel of the u.s. lunar space program the world knows how the Apollo program began but very few truly understand how it ended this is the remarkable story of the determination and courage of a generation a tribute to three brave astronauts and the thousands of men and women behind them during the final days of NASA's Apollo program in 1961 when President Kennedy launched the Apollo program the Space Age was only in its fourth year the commitment of sending a man across the hostile ocean of space to the moon was bold but necessary America urgently needed a powerful demonstration of its technological superiority to convince the world that it could still contain the threat of Soviet aggression I think the Americans were very confident that they had a much superior system they were looking towards the Soviet Union as a pretty backward Society and then all of a sudden on the 12th of April 1961 Yuri Gagarin became the first human being to orbit the planet that put the Americans certainly at a cultural level into a bit of a panic it's fair to say that if the Americans had put the first human being into space then we wouldn't have had the political drive for success that culminated in project Apollo in the 1960s the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA began assembling a task force of 400,000 top scientists and technicians that over the next seven years would develop the vast spectrum of technologies needed to put a man on the moon I got involved in the Apollo principally because of my I think obsession with spaceflight I started with reading down there and Eagle like a lot of people did and then there was an advert in the Daily Telegraph which said they were looking for people to work on the Apollo program in the States and I thought this was just the bee's knees so I applied and got the job I thought I'd died and gone to heaven everybody who worked on Apollo was so enthusiastic of course it was the race to space and it was just magic involvement in the Apollo program was really a fantastic thing it seemed that almost anything was possible I worked for lucky the electronics company and I supported the guidance and control division laboratory it was exciting at times it was scary at times but working on it gave a sense of achievement Kennedy's dream was finally realized in July 1969 when Apollo 11 touched down on the lunar surface marking man's most significant accomplishments in the history of exploration photographs of flags and footprints were beamed around the world America's prestige had been re won and they established themselves as the world's superpower politically the race to beat the Russians to the moon had been won but NASA's scientific mission was just beginning over the next two years their confidence and proficiency in lunar exploration went from strength to strength but in 1970 despite this monumental achievement the ten proposed missions were cut short making Apollo 17 NASA's final lunar mission the public was losing interest because they just saw people going to the moon time time again apparently doing the same things not realizing what science was being done so with a lack of public interest the government started to lose interest scientifically so tremendous loss and had 18 19 and 20 been allowed to continue then has no doubt our knowledge of the moon and the history of the early solar system would be much bigger now than what it is have those missions continued so scientifically there was every reason to continue them if Apollo 17 was to be the last visit to the moon NASA needed to make it count NASA's growing confidence in supporting longer operations meant that Apollo 17 would become the most productive lunar mission of the entire program Apollo 17 was a mission of superlatives in so many ways and it broke so many records the crew spent three days on the lunar surface as their moon walks lasted eight hours they covered a greater distance than any other mission and yet by December 1972 most of the American public and much of the global public had lost interest completely so I always think of Apollo 17 as being the hidden jewel of the u.s. lunar space program Apollo 17s mission commander was former US Navy pilot and veteran astronauts Eugene Cernan he is one of only three men who have voyage to the moon twice Cernan first flew on the Gemini program and later became the lunar module pilot on Apollo 10 the dress rehearsal for the lunar landing where he flew within 15 kilometers of the surface Cernan had to wait three years and six missions until he would fly again and finally set foot on the moon Gene Cernan was very good he was very very competent and all these people were so keen to do a good job on the moon it was it was really amazing they really wanted to to put our hardware out there and get it working and and getting the science command module pilot Ronald Evans was selected late into the Apollo program while flying combat missions in Vietnam Apollo 17 would be his first and only spaceflight Joe Engel was the proposed lunar module pilot but after Apollo 18 was cancelled and it became clear that this would be the final lunar mission the scientific community pressed NASA to select a scientist astronaut to go to the moon Engle was dropped from the program and Harrison Schmitt also known as Jang Schmidt took his place to become the first and only geologist to step foot on the moon Jack Schmitt was picked as one of the first six original scientists astronauts in 1965 people said he had a fanatical focus upon Apollo that there were some of his colleagues who doubted that he had any other life apart from Apollo but he got himself noticed for the right reasons totally committed changed geology training for the astronauts raised the profile of geology within the entire program I'm Harrison Schmitt on Apollo 15 he was the backup lunar module pilot the experiments that I was working on had to be exercised by each crew member before we loaded them into the lunar module and sent them off to the moon so Hirsch and Schmitt came over to have a look at the experiment and picked up the magnifying glass and he looked at it and he said do you know what the geologist does when he finds a rock to look at and we said no and he said he does this he said have you ever tried doing that in a spacesuit but he was a great guy to work with very easy and very professional as most of them were on the 6th of December 1972 the countdown to launch had begun on the pad at the Kennedy Space Center stood the enormous Saturn 5 rocket it is still the largest vehicle ever to put human beings in space it weighed about six point two eight million pounds of thrust of the first stage was 7.5 million pounds just a really remarkable accomplishment the one thing that I don't think anybody in this business ever feels is fear otherwise you would not be out there walking to the rocket you better have gotten used to that idea a long time ago the thing that's different about launch day is that the launch pad is empty there's nobody else there but you once that van drops you off at the spacecraft and you get in that elevator you get in the elevator or any other time you're out there looking at things that are people you know like ants they're everywhere but not that night and then we went across the catwalk to the command module hatch it was a steel mesh floor so walking over you could look down and see the whole thing almost everybody gets a little bit of a feeling in their stomach when they do that No Roger flies loose so this will be through piston please watch my booster as one Cebu pass complete we're on in town power and window at 12:33 on the morning of December 7 1972 they got the go for launch 20 seconds and counting seconds guidance is internal 25 Paulo seven teams the only night launch of the Saturn 5 rocket it turned night into day and even from 500 miles away it was incredibly bright and light sky I think it was a fitting end to project Apollo that that night Lord really summarized what the whole program is around one of the things that you don't get in your training is the physical feeling of the launch I got a pensioner all over having a baby and really gone on to that and I'm caught one round it's a very heavy low-frequency vibration the first thing that I remember thinking was why did we do all the simulations because I couldn't read anything on the gauges that vibration we had two orbits of the earth before we were going to restart that third stage rocket that had inserted us into orbit in order to accelerate to 25,000 miles an hour and go to the moon at a distance of 45,000 kilometers the crew took what is believed to be the most widely distributed photographic image of all time famously known as the Blue Marble this incredible image was the first picture of the fully illuminated face of planet Earth we are seeing the earth as it truly is a grand oasis in the vastness of space we take off hanate for granted but seeing it like that sort of isolated from everything it does have a different perspective and I think in some ways it almost stimulated the environmental movement we saw our planet as a whole and we saw it as vulnerable the picture of the earthers of blue marble brought home to people how fragile our earth is and how stupid all the arguments are between nations we're just all on this big spaceship together and we better get along no human being has since been at a distance we're taking a whole earth photograph like this has been possible exactly which of the Apollo crew took this amazing images unclear but like so many other aspects of the Apollo program this breathtaking photograph changed our perception of our beautiful planet forever Seventeen's landing site was a small valley located in the taurus littoral region taurus littrow sits close to the edge of an impact basin this vast Basin was formed about 3.9 billion years ago as a result of a comet or asteroid collision the saint's geological significance was of great interest to nasa taurus littrow was chosen as a landing site for the last apollo mission because it was a mixture of highland and lowland terrain and of course they had a geologist as the principal investigator if you like on the mission itself and i guess he was in his element driving around they at the moon's surface after four days and traveling 380,000 kilometers the crew of Apollo 17 began orbiting the moon we as human beings committed ourselves to a gravitational field with another planet and that was the first time Apollo was the first time that human beings did that there's no absolute guarantee that you were going to return but it broke that bond with the earth that ultimately I'm sure will lead humans on a path to the settlement away from our earth command module pilot Ronald Evans stayed in lunar orbit conducting experiments bug Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt descended to the surface to complete their research okay one five one one five one zero enter 42 degrees 47 now 47 degrees through 49 degrees okay off like a fellers done above Atlantic retro no I don't know where Copland selling Giri I go to the Langham I'll need the pro I'll give it to you are we coming in Oh baby and darn and and cry and incredible the lunar module pilot doesn't get to look outside very much my job was to make sure that the commander had information off the computer that would tell him where he was going and gave him information as we got closer to the surface on his good 1,500 feet 54 degrees into 800 feet they've gotten a little high they I don't need a number anymore okay you're 31 feet per second one down to 500 that's a little high it okay one down and five it feels good but in this big vampirism that little forward G getting a little bit then 460 feet or not about to very little does very little guys 40 feet going on three stand by 25 feet down and two feels good 20 feet going out a 2 and B stand by and feet that contact that push and stop engine are both equal right on both control an old big shot off hey if the detector has landed and until American intelligent adorned with drunk phagon doctor that remember on December 11th at 7:54 p.m. the lunar module Challenger touched down on the moon's surface thank you we took on a year into your library like I never put a flag up and pull that in you have to get it down at my level tall guys are all alike okay I thought like it's waving in the breeze different era how about right there it does way when you do that she does it all picture you guys up down that let me tell you Bob that flag is a beautiful picture my first concern stepping on the moon was to stay with the timeline and as I came down the ladder I was really was thinking of how we get maximum use of the time that was available I had made a calculation at the time I have no idea what was right or not but that the time on the moon was worth about a million dollars a man minute and that got my attention and those are those year dollars not this year dollars raised at the panoramic inner beauty come on Bob hey Bob effective at array look very flat food that's why you're an astronomer oh well so the first half hour so I was in very familiar territory because I was primarily looking at the lunar module I was working around it we were unloading things so that we would need including the roving vehicle and things like that when I first had a chance to move away from the spacecraft my first duty was to go to the points of an equilateral triangle around the lunar module and take a set of pictures that would give as much of a pristine view of the landing site as we could and that was the first time I had a chance to really see the lunar module in the context of this place where we had landed taurus-littrow was a deep mountain valley deeper than the Grand Canyon as a matter of fact the mountains on either side rose to 6 and 7,000 feet above the valley floor and were brilliantly illuminated by a Sun is brightest one that you can imagine either in high snow fields or in the desert but they were silhouetted against a black sky an absolute black sky and that's what you cannot get from the pictures that are printed which doesn't give you the contrast that the eye sees when you're there torez littrow was the most dangerous landing site of the entire Apollo program although the risk taken to land in the taurus littrow valley were great the payoff was the opportunity to sample a larger and more diverse selection of geological material than ever before oh it had pretty inside whoo yeah anything like this I haven't I bet you've been holding out on me the samples returned would contain rock both older and younger than that of any other Apollo mission tourists naturally was selected because it was a diverse site geologically within a dressy driving distance of the landing site there are these Highland blocks as the North Mercy from the South Massif these Highland blocks were formed as mountains more brittle imagery based on photographs taken by Apollo 15 had demonstrated the existence of boulders which had rolled down the mountains from high up on the slopes where they'd carved tracks and so accessing these boulders that had rolled down the massif s-- became a high priority in addition to these boulders a small fault runs across the valley quaterly Lincoln scarp which he was considered would beep of geological interest and there was a landslide of clearly light-colored Highland material to fallen off the South Massif mountain and covered the valley floor so all in all it was a very geologically diverse valley where a lot could be explored in the time available to the astronauts with their lunar roving vehicle got a bag compact the flower for brightening the rocks in addition to their geological studies Cernan and Schmitt were to perform several experiments the Apollo lunar surface experiment package are all set contained for experiments never before deployed on the moon there was a brand-new experiment to look at the lunar atmosphere and now the lunar atmosphere is a very good vacuum but there are gases around and it was a mass spectrometer that could actually detect different kinds of gases there was a thing called a gravimeter which was a very very sensitive gravity measuring device trying to measure the moon's gravitational pull and looking for a very very slow moonquakes to see if they existed there was the lunar ejector a meteoroid experiment which was looking for small meteorites coming down and impacting it dust sized ones and then finally another seismic experiment with explosive charges which were put out on the lunar surface they drove around in the rover and then they were fired later on from the earth commands were sent when the crew had left and they sent seismic shocks quite deeply down into the surface so that we could see what the strata was like underneath the surface of the Moon the totality of scientific instruments and measurements deployed on the moon by Apollo 17 considering was all done in three days and had to be combined with all this driving around and sampling it's really remarkable the lunar rover was an outstanding vehicle for field exploration he had weighed about 450 earth pounds without anything on it you got a little bit heavier as we got on it and put our equipment there it could go about 6 or 7 miles per hour over that surface now that doesn't sound like very much but I'll tell you remember one-sixth gravity you hit a bump and you're gonna be off the surface a bit then it it does seem like it's going a lot faster than that we actually had it up to 18 kilometers in the heart which would be about 12 or 13 miles an hour going downhill once and I think even Gene Cernan regretted going quite that fast it was pretty hard the rovard was a very very productive vehicle and a tribute to the people who design and built it the crew were on their first extra vehicular activity or Eevee a when Cernan brushed against the rover a hammer in the shin pocket of his spacesuit Conte the buggies rear fender and torrid enhance Gene Cernan turned around and just scraped against the fender of the lunar roving vehicle and it snapped a little bit of it off now we might think that this was no big deal but we need to remember on the surface of the moon this lunar dust used to get absolutely everywhere with the lunar roving vehicle traveling at about ten or eleven miles an hour at top speed it was throwing lunar dust everywhere not only were the astronauts get covered with the material but the material was very dark now remember in an airless environment if you're exposed to direct sunlight you're gonna heat up massively it's one of the reasons that the outer layer of the Apollo astronauts suits were white and so what seems to us on earth to be a relatively minor issue was going to seriously compromise the potential science that could have been obtained from the rest of the mission with the dust threatening the astronauts safety something had to be done in spite of his thick gloves Gene Cernan managed to unroll and tear off strips of duct tape in an attempt to repair the damaged fender that's better hey God I would take a picture of it is that like some sort of mending the war of hope keep your fingers crossed and I'll be more careful around offenders okay happy that is quick fix solution held out for the next four hours they continued to drive the rover without any problem stomping to drill holes collect core samples and deploy seismic charges but while on a rough patch of lunar terrain the fender broke again and a new problem arose a thick coating of dark lunar dust began covering the rover's batteries which were now absorbing the heat from the Sun and at risk of overheating but we got pretty dirty we cleaned our pressure suits between every VA but you could see the scratches on the wrists and on the helmet good engineering is going to have to keep the dust out of things it is very abrasive but you could still see the scratches yours truly doesn't prove I was on the moon but I seem to have had an awful good time while I was there and not at all a bashful about standing around in my underwear back at Houston NASA engineers understood the seriousness of the situation if they couldn't come up with a solution while Cernan and Schmitt slept the next day's exploration would be severely inhibited limiting the astronauts to within walking distance of the lunar module Apollo 16 commander John Young was on the case John Young spent the night working in a spacesuit back at Houston working out a procedure to fix it and they they worked out that they would use a an old map that they'd already been using they didn't need again they taped it into a curve and then found two little clamps which they could use to clamp it to the dust guard when the astronauts woke the next morning Mission Control and instructions for a replacement fender the new Fender held for the rest of the mission which was to be another 15 hours of EVs Apollo 17s true science potential was saved by duct tape don't go anywhere without it although the lunar rover allowed the astronauts to cover great distances they still had to travel on foot when setting up experiments and collecting samples they quickly became confident moving in the lower gravity of the moon which is 1/6 or dog Hill but that like this and a local crowd I can skip I was rolling on the move one day they did however end up with their leaves in the dust on the other than one occasion okay yep hey mommy the dots my camera Julia overhead retention camera I'll get this thing out now that I got it Oh boys you guys what the car get down and do your work now dad God with your over health twinkle toes anytime you fell a little bit homesick you could look up and see the earth only 240,000 miles away I must say though that the communications were outstanding I never felt like slated over not at all during their second DVA the crew visited a crater named shorty crater shorty had excited scientists back on earth as it's surrounded by a halo of soil that is significantly darker than the general terrain after the seven kilometer drive to shorty crater harrison schmitt looked to the soil stirred up by his feet he found what is considered to be one of the most significant of all all those discoveries oh well don't move it to life it if I hold it till I see it I've stirred it up with my feet you know there's a stereotype about about Sciences being dull and unemotional I think the story of the orange soil on Apollo 17 just blows that myth to pieces because when you look at the pictures of the Moon they could be color pictures but the moon looks pretty gray and then all of a sudden on Apollo 17 in this monochrome landscape you've got bright orange soil appearing now when this was reported you can hear it in the voices back in Mission Control you know there is orange soil there's excitement and I'll never forget that there's one of the geologists supporting the mission and he is almost shaking with excitement the significance of this was that the orange soil it was thought could be evidence of volcanic activity now this landing site had been chosen specifically to try and look for evidence of volcanic activity so it's I think the words that Jack Schmitt used well I think we found what we were looking for when analyzed to a microscope the colored soil turns out to be made of tiny tens of micron sized orange glass beads that's been erupted in a fire fountain eruption in the in the taurus littrow valley the orange glasses are in fact the youngest samples found in the taurus littrow valley but they're still 3.6 thousand million years old because the moon seems to be so dry it had been assumed that the primary volatile responsible for driving these fire fountains was carbon dioxide gas but evidence has been found that some of the volatiles responsible for driving this volcanism may have been water after all and so these glasses are still 40 years on actively at the center of Luna Luna science today and as I step out onto the plane to a toilet roll Oh what did I say Oh buddy there's not a cloud this guy Stephanie earth the astronauts third and finally VA provided an opportunity to study the large boulders that had ruled down the north wall of the taurus littrow valley this large boulder had rolled down the North Massif about a kilometer and a half I'm there for scale it hit a change in slope and broke broke into five pieces there and stopped and it has told us a great deal about the nature of these huge impacts that have occurred on the moon and before that occurred on the earth that's one of the brutal acts bobbinet Korea a light colored fragment they've learned the full height of it about a metre and a half thick and then it got the grey a blue play rock on the other side I think there I am hopes in the middle of boulder field just minding my own business in lunar orbit run evans conducted extensive experiments from the command module america charting the lunar surface using a panoramic camera and laser altimeter used in conjunction with other scientific instrumentation evans collected more information for accurately mapping the surface of the moon the invaluable images and data collected by apollo are still widely used by research scientists and astronomers today Ron Evans so seemed to have a lot of fun while he was alone up there one of the problems with the source of our water who was that a little bit of hydrogen would leak into the water and here Ranas worked that hydrogen into a bubble so that he could take it back and demonstrate they had missed getting that hydrogen the reason it was important to us is that you know we what goes in must come out and much to the discomfort of your crewmates before leaving for the moon Cernan made a very special promise to his daughter he told her that he would write her initials in the lunar dust making her the only little girl on earth to have her name on the moon just before Apollo 17 left the moon Cernan took a moment to kneel and with a single finger wrote his daughter Traci's initials T DC in the lunar dust knowing those three letters would remain there undisturbed for millions of years Apollo 17 was a record-breaking mission during their three days on the moon Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt completed 22 hours of lunar exploration and research more than any other Apollo mission that had gone before they had driven a total of 34 kilometers through the taurus littrow valley and positioned the most comprehensive set of instruments ever deployed on the lunar surface they had collected and documented over a hundred and ten kilograms of moon rock and soil and taken over 2,400 photographs but now it was time to go home in their final moments on the moon Harrison Schmitt made a rather unusual request there's an interesting scene from the the last moments of the final Eevee a on the surface of the Moon in Apollo 17 and it was Jack Schmitt and is his hammer throwing now I'm not sure if this is a geologists tradition or it was just a Jack Schmitt tradition but when you look at the footage you can see that gene cernan's getting ready to throw it and Jack really wants to throw it and Gene Cernan almost there's a recognition of the great work that he's done says okay Jack you go ahead and do it and you see him throwing it away I think that it may well have been an old geologists tradition I know that a definite geologists tradition is is tradition of rolling pebbles or rolling boulders Jack Schmitt indulged that and he also got Gene Cernan to do that as well and they did do their rock rolling on the surface of the Moon during Apollo 17 the pressure of producing the speech to draw to an end the first set of manned explorations on the moon fell on mission commander Eugene Cernan he had prayed that when the time came he would find words of power and purpose as he surveyed the lunar landscape for the very last time he spoke from the heart and closed a chapter of human courage back on earth at Mission Control edy fen del who had been responsible for remotely operating the lunar cameras during Apollo 17 was poised to capture the one shot that had eluded NASA over the previous five missions a clean view of the lunar module takeoff this would be the last chance to get his elusive shot with a six second signal delay fend L had to correctly time the movement of the camera with the flight path of the lunar module in advance the results were truly spectacular bye take a feel good there y'all back up here it's been a good trip and I've gone to the beautiful vehicle following the rendezvous and dunking with Ron Evans in the command module the crew proceeded to transfer the precious lunar samples and film Apollo 17 spent an additional three days in lunar orbit conducting yet more orbital science and they would be the last men to witness the famous earth rise and believe the moon into little believe this became a God willing as we shall return big time Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17 on the return journey Ron Evans had the chance to complete an Eevee a of his own leaving the safety of the command module he ventured on a spacewalk to retrieve vital film from the on-board external cameras three days later will be entered the Earth's atmosphere our actual entry piqued geez at seven times gravity just for an instant because we wanted to be sure of course we were captured in the atmosphere the command module actually was flown by the computer at thirty five thousand miles an hour almost anything is going to have lift about some kind if you oriented right and in the command module did at this point we had gone through the deployment of broke shoots at 25,000 feet and then this deployment of the main shoots at about 10,000 feet and we were moving down towards the water leave at about 16 feet per second apollo 17 may have been viewed by many cynics as a lackluster mission but nothing could be further from the truth when the crew finally splashed down in the warm blue waters of the Pacific Ocean it didn't just signify the closing of the Apollo program but the true end of an era Apollo has transformed the way we look at the moon Apollo has transformed our understanding of the moon's importance there is a treasure trove of discoveries still to be made from the lunar samples from the instruments that are still active on the surface of the Moon yes it was an incredibly expensive program but when you've got something which 40 years later is still enabling new scientists to develop new ideas and new theories then that tells you something about the program's value there was an extraordinary period in human history we gained a first-order understanding of another planet for the first time and what was accomplished by the generation of Apollo does symbolize a great new understanding of what we now know about the early history of the earth it symbolizes a new source of resources for the planet particularly in energy and it symbolizes a new path to the settlement of our solar system before we went to the moon all we knew about it was what we could get from telescopes getting to the moon being able to bring samples back to be able to make measurements of its atmospheric magnetic field what its structure was taught us a lot not only about the moon but how the earth and the moon were created originally Apollo 17 was the the culmination of the whole Apollo program and it put a lot of very satisfactory line under the whole thing and scientists are still studying the the data brought back by the whole program certainly a poly 17 was the most productive scientifically in terms of samples returned and scientific instruments deployed I think 17 did mark the end of an era since then we haven't traveled into space as far that's impetus to get out there - almost travel to the Stars has waned it told the man that more or less anything was possible it brought everybody together I think for the first time people all over the world were interested in one thing and what was going on at one time the Apollo missions have ended but we need something to take its place and something to inspire people and something to get us as the human race out there and beyond many believe that a return to the moon holds the key to man's future in space we will be going back to the moon but they must move if we're going to Mars is to go back to the moon because if we can't keep people supported on the moon and keep them in good condition it's no good going to Mars because we won't be able to do it when a heck of a lot further away we can do it we could go to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s we could go to the moon now if we had the political willpower and if we decided to put the financing in none of the astronauts involved would have expected us to be here four decades later and still not having seen a return to the moon but ultimately the Apollo how times will be the challenge of getting a human being to Mars it's not just about exploration it's about securing the future for Humanity that's what human beings have done throughout history we have been a species that wants to explore to push forward our frontiers the earth is our cradle but we can't stay in the cradle forever whatever the future holds one thing is for sure Apollo's overwhelming contribution to science has given us a new perspective on the moon our own unique planet and the universe beyond I was sad that the program came to an end obviously we'd like it to have gone on much longer but even though Apollo ended and we were sad we continued with some really exciting work it was a fantastic experience I definitely feel proud that I was part of the Apollo program even though a very minor cog in a big machine if I had my time again I most certainly would move heaven and earth to work on something like that again it was really fun Apollo 17 was a fitting conclusion to a triumphant space program which will inspire future generations for many years to come with NASA achieved in the decade following Kennedy's pledge is a testament to man's ingenuity we chose to go to the mall not because they are easy but because they are hard many years ago great British explorer George Mallory who was to die on Mount Everest was asked why did he want to climb it he said because it is there while space as they and we're going to climb it and the moon and the planets of a and New Hope's for knowledge and peace of a and therefore as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on which man has ever embarked you"

Since the early 1970s conspiracy theorists have created ever more elaborate stories about how NASA faked the moon landings, much to the annoyance of the literal hundreds of thousands of people who worked in some capacity to make these missions a reality, and even more so to the men who were brave enough to sit in front of a massive controlled explosion, take a little jaunt through the soul crushing void of space in an extremely complex ship built by the lowest bidder, then get into another spacecraft whose ascent engine had never been test fired before they lit the candle, and all with the goal of exiting said ship with only a special suit between them and oblivion.

 have created ever more elaborate stories about how NASA faked the moon landings, much to
 the annoyance of the literal hundreds of thousands of people who worked in some capacity to make
 these missions a reality, and even more so to the men who were brave enough to sit in
 front of a massive controlled explosion, take a little jaunt through the soul crushing void
 of space in an extremely complex ship built by the lowest bidder, then get into another
 spacecraft whose ascent engine had never been test fired before they lit the candle, and
 all with the goal of exiting said ship with only a special suit between them and oblivion. And don't even get the astronauts started
 on the paltry government salary they earned in doing all that and the hilarious lengths
 they had to go to to provide some semblance of a life insurance policy for their families
 should the worst happen during the missions. So who first got the idea that the moon landings
 were faked? While it's highly likely there were at least
 a few individuals here and there who doubted man could accomplish such a thing a little
 over a half century after the end of period in which humans were still hitching up covered
 wagons, the first to really get the moon landing hoax story going popularly was a writer named
 Bill Kaysing. How did he do it? Kaysing self-published a book in 1976 called
 We Never Went to the Moon: America's Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle. Released a few years after the Apollo 17 mission
 in 1972, Kaysing’s book popularly introduced some of the most well known talking points
 of moon landing deniers, such as that the astronauts should have been killed when they
 passed through the Van Allen radiation belts, noting the lack of stars in photographs, the
 missing blast crater below the lunar modules, etc. Beyond these, he also had some more, let's
 say, ""unusual"" and occasionally offensive assertions which even the most ardent moon
 landing denier would probably rather distance themselves from. Not exactly a best-seller, Kaysing's book
 nonetheless laid the ground work for some of what would come after, with the idea further
 gaining steam in part thanks to the 1978 film Capricorn 1, which shows NASA faking a Mars
 landing and then going to any lengths to keep it a secret. As for the film, director Peter Hyams states
 he first got the idea for such a movie when musing over the Apollo 11 mission and thinking,
 ""There was one event of really enormous importance that had almost no witnesses. And the only verification we have . . . came
 from a TV camera."" Not an accurate statement in the slightest
 on the latter point, it nonetheless got the wheels turning and he ultimately developed
 a script based on this notion. As to how Kaysing before him came to the conclusion
 that NASA faked the moon landings, the story, at least as Kaysing tells it, is that in the
 late 1950s he managed to view the results of a highly secretive internal study conducted
 by NASA on the feasibility of man successfully landing on the moon that concluded, in his
 own words: “That the chance of success was something like .0017 percent. In other words, it was hopeless.” Kaysing doesn't explain how NASA came up with
 such a precise figure given all the unknown variables at the time, nor why he put the
 qualifier ""something like"" followed by such an extremely exact number. He also did not name the report itself. And, in fact, as far as we can tell, NASA
 never conducted such an all encompassing study on the feasibility of a successful moon landing
 in the 1950s. Whether they did or not, we did find in our
 research looking for that report that NASA conducted a feasibility study on the proposed
 designs for several manned rockets immediately prior to Apollo program to decide which contractor
 to use. This, of course, has nothing to do with Kaysing,
 but we figured we’d mention it as we like to deal in facts and reading Kaysing's various
 works has us feeling like we need to be cleansed a little by saying things that are actually
 true about NASA in this period. In any event, Kaysing would later assert that
 he determined from this report that there’s no way NASA could have improved these 0.0017%
 odds in the time between the results of this supposed study and the moon landings about
 a decade later. Now, if Kaysing was just some random guy shouting
 in the wind, it's unlikely anyone would have listened to him. Every conspiracy theory origin story needs
 at least some shred of credibility from the person starting it to get the fire going. For Kaysing’s assertions about the moon
 landings, this comes in the form of the fact that for a brief period he worked for Rocketdyne,
 a company that made rockets for the Apollo program. Not an engineer or having any similar technical
 expertise whatsoever, Kaysing's background was primarily in writing, earning an English
 degree from the University of Redlands, after which he naturally got a job making furniture. As for the writing gig he landed with Rocketdyne,
 his job was initially as a technical writer starting in 1956 and he eventually worked
 his way up to head of technical publications. He finally quit in 1963, deciding he'd had
 enough of working for the man. After quitting, to quote him, “the rat race”,
 in 1963 Kaysing traveled the country in a trailer with his family, earning his living
 writing books on a variety of topics from motorcycles to farming. This brings us to 1969 when he, like most
 everyone else in the world with access to a TV watched the moon landing. While watching, Kaysing recalled the supposed
 NASA study he’d seen all those years ago, as well as that engineers he'd worked with
 at the time in the late 1950s claimed that while the technology existed to get the astronauts
 to the moon, getting them back was not yet possible. He later stated he further thought,
 “As late as 1967 three astronauts died in a horrendous fire on the launch pad. But as of '69, we could suddenly perform manned
 flight upon manned flight? With complete success? It's just against all statistical odds.” Despite often describing himself as “the
 fastest pen in the west”, it would take Kaysing several years to write the book that
 introduced one of the most enduring conspiracy theories to the world. As for why NASA would bother with the charade,
 he claimed NASA worked in tandem with the Defence Intelligence Agency to fake the moon
 landings to one up those pesky Russians. While certainly good for the country if they
 could get away with it, the benefit to NASA itself was, of course, funding. Said Kaysing, ""They - both NASA and Rocketdyne
 - wanted the money to keep pouring in."" As to how he knew this, he goes on ""I've worked
 in aerospace long enough to know that's their goal."" So how did NASA do it? He claimed that the footage of the moon landing
 was actually filmed on a soundstage. When later asked where this soundstage was
 located, Kaysing confidently stated that it was located in Area 51. As he doesn't seem to have ever given clear
 evidence as to how he knew this, we can only assume because it’s not a proper space related
 conspiracy theory if Area 51 isn't mentioned. Kaysing also claimed that the F-1 engines
 used were too unreliable so NASA instead put several B-1 rockets inside each of the F-1
 engines. Of course, in truth these wouldn't have been
 powerful enough to get the Saturn V into orbit even if its tanks were mostly empty. (And given the frost and ice clearly visible
 covering certain relevant parts of the Saturn V here, it's apparent the tanks could not
 have been mostly empty). There's also the little problem that the clusters
 of B-1s he described couldn't have fit in the F-1 engine bells and you can see footage
 of the F-1 engines working as advertised, with no clusters of engines anywhere in sight. Nevertheless, despite these problems with
 his story, he did purport that the Saturn V was launched to space as shown (though at
 other times has claimed that in fact as soon as the rocket was out of sight it was simply
 ditched in the ocean and never made it to space). Stick with us here people, he changed his
 story a lot over the years. Whatever the case, in all initial cases, he
 claims the astronauts were not aboard. (And if you're now wondering how the U.S.
 fooled the Soviets and other nations tracking the rockets during these missions, he claims
 a way to fake signals was devised, allowing for tracking stations on Earth to think the
 craft was headed for the moon and, critically, successfully fooling the Soviets who were
 indeed closely tracking the missions to the moon and back.) So what did Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and
 Michael Collins do during the mission if they weren’t zipping around in space? In the first edition of his book, Kaysing
 claims that they flew to Las Vegas where they mostly hung out at strip clubs when they weren't
 in their rooms on the 24th floor of the Sands Hotel. We can't make this stuff up, but apparently
 Kaysing can. Kaysing goes on that at one point one of the
 trio got into a fistfight with someone in broad daylight over a stripper. Sadly Kaysing doesn’t reveal which of the
 men did this, nor how he knew about it, so we’re forced to assume it was Buzz Aldrin
 who is the only member of the three we definitely know actually has gotten in a fist fight. In this case, in 2002, a 72 year old Buzz
 Aldrin punched Bart Sibrel who is a “we never landed on the moon” conspiracy theorist,
 “documentary” maker, and cab driver. Sibrel invited Aldrin to a hotel with Sibrel
 telling him he was making a children’s TV show on space. Once Aldrin arrived at the hotel, Sibrel pulled
 out a Bible and tried to get Aldrin to put his hand on it and swear that he had walked
 on the moon. Needless to say, Aldrin was pretty irritated
 at this point. Things got worse when Sibrel called Aldrin
 a “liar” and a “coward”, at which point Aldrin punched him. As for his defense, Sibrel states, ""When someone
 has gotten away with a crime, in my opinion, they deserve to be ambushed. I'm a journalist trying to get at the truth."" Unwilling to sway on what that truth is, however,
 Sibrel states, ""I do know the moon landings were faked. I'd bet my life on it."" Not all is lost, however, because he states,
 ""I know personally that Trump knows the moon landings are fake and he’s biding his time
 to reveal it at the end of this term, or at the end of his second term if he’s re-elected."" So, rest easy everyone, the truth will come
 out soon enough apparently. In any event, going back to Kaysing’s book,
 he states that shortly before the astronauts were supposed to begin broadcasting from the
 moon, all three men arrived on a soundstage deep within the confines of Area 51 and ate
 cheese sandwiches. He also states that along with cheese sandwiches,
 NASA provided the men with buxom showgirls while at Area 51. Presumably this was the only way to pry the
 astronauts away from the strip clubs. After eating the no doubt delicious sandwiches,
 Aldrin and Armstrong put on some space suits and pretended to walk across a fake moon set
 while reading out some, to quote Kaysing, “well-rehearsed lines” in a performance
 he called “not great” but “good enough”. A description we personally feel is a little
 unfair considering it has apparently fooled seemingly every scientist on Earth then to
 now, including ones working for the nation directly competing with the US to land on
 the moon who would have relished any opportunity to even allege the whole thing was faked in
 a credible way, let alone prove it and embarrass the U.S. utterly in front of the whole world. But, unfortunately, as you might imagine,
 the Soviets at the time were monitoring the whole thing quite closely with their newfangled
 technology and so never got the opportunity to disprove the landings. Amazingly Kaysing also claimed in his book
 that the fake moon landing footage was filmed live and that there was only “a seven second
 delay” between Armstrong and Aldrin’s performance and the broadcast the world was
 watching. Thus, had even a fly buzzed across the set,
 NASA would have only seconds to notice and cut the feed, lest such a mistake or inconsistency
 be noticed in the footage people would be watching for the rest of human history. As for the splash down and recovery, he claims
 the astronauts were eventually put on a military cargo plane (a Lockheed C-5 Galaxy) and simply
 dropped from it in the capsule. As for how he knew this, he did provide a
 source for once, claiming that an airline pilot he talked to had seen the Apollo 15
 module drop from a cargo plane. Who this pilot was, what airline he worked
 for, if he offered any evidence to support his claim, such as a flight log showing him
 piloting a plane in the area during the time of the splash down of Apollo 15, or even when
 he talked to said pilot, however, he fails to mention. As for the moon rocks brought back, these
 were apparently meteorites found in Antarctica as well as some that were cleverly made in
 a NASA geology lab. As to how NASA was able to keep the lid on
 things, despite nearly a half a million people working on the Apollo Program in some capacity,
 not just for NASA but countless independent organizations, he claims NASA simply only
 let those who needed to know the whole thing was a hoax know. So following this reasoning that means all
 these scientists, engineers, etc. working on all the components and various facets of
 the mission were genuinely trying to make the moon landing happen, including knowing
 the requirements to make it happen and testing everything they made until it met those requirements... Meaning what was built and planned should
 have been capable of doing what the mission required... That said, Kaysing admits a handful of people
 here and there would have had to know the whole thing was a sham, and thus NASA simply
 paid off those who could be paid off, promoted those who preferred that reward, threatened
 those who still wouldn't go along, and murdered those who still resisted, which we'll get
 into shortly. The ridiculousness of many of these claims
 and how easily they crumple under the slightest bit of scrutiny is likely why in the 2002
 re-release of his book Kaysing changed his story in various ways, including claiming
 that the engines on the Saturn V actually did work and that Collins, Aldrin and Armstrong
 did go to space after all, instead of going to hang out with strippers in Vegas. He then states that all three men orbited
 the planet while pre-recorded, not live, footage was shown on Earth. Despite, to put it mildly, straining credibility
 on pretty much everything he said from start to finish and him providing absurdly specific
 details, generally without bothering to provide any evidence whatsoever backing up these claims
 and changing those specific details frequently over time, Kaysing’s book and subsequent
 work nonetheless helped spawn the still thriving moon landing hoax conspiracy theory. As for Kaysing, he didn't stop there. He continued to sporadically come up with
 new allegations against NASA, including that the agency murdered the astronauts and teacher
 aboard the Challenger explosion. Why would they do this when the whole Christa
 McAuliffe thing was supposed to be a publicity stunt to get the public more interested in
 space travel, science, and what NASA was doing? According to Kaysing, “Christa McAuliffe,
 the only civilian and only woman aboard, refused to go along with the lie that you couldn't
 see stars in space. So they blew her up, along with six other
 people, to keep that lie under wraps...” Speaking of things that Kaysing said that
 are ridiculously easy to debunk with even a modicum of effort, we feel obligated to
 point out that Christa McAuliffe was not the only woman on board. NASA astronaut Judith Resnik was also killed
 in that tragedy. Not stopping there, Kaysing also claimed the
 deaths of the Apollo 1 astronauts were intentional as one or more of the astronauts aboard was
 about to blow the whistle on the upcoming hoax plan. We feel obligated to point out here that,
 as previously mentioned, he also used this fire as evidence of NASA lacking expertise
 to get a man to the moon... Meaning according to Kaysing this fire was
 somehow both intentional to murder a few astronauts and also accidental owing to NASA's incompetence. Moving swiftly on, NASA officials also apparently
 had others killed, including safety inspector at North American Aviation Thomas Baron who
 wrote a report on NASA safety protocol violations after that tragic Apollo 1 fire. It's at this point, we should probably note
 that in the 1990s Kaysing decided to sue Jim Lovell. You see, in 1996 Lovell publicly stated ""The
 guy is wacky. His position makes me feel angry. We spent a lot of time getting ready to go
 to the moon. We spent a lot of money, we took great risks,
 and it's something everybody in this country should be proud of."" Lovell also wrote to Kaysing asking him to
 ""Tear up your manuscript and pursue a project that has some meaning. Leave a legacy you can be proud of, not some
 trash whose readers will doubt your sanity."" Unwilling to stand for his good name being
 publicly besmirched, Kaysing naturally sued Lovell for defamation, though the case was
 eventually dismissed and nothing ever came of it. Kaysing continued to assert that the moon
 landings were a hoax right up until his death in 2005, in between writing books on cookery,
 motorcycle safety, farming, taxes, survival, how to subsist on very little money, and travel
 guides, as well as making occasional appearances on such shows as Oprah expounding on his conspiracy
 theory work. On the side he also promoted micro-housing
 as a solution for homeless people and ran a cat sanctuary called ""FLOCK"", standing for
 ""For the Love of Cats and Kittens"". So, yes, Kaysing was a man whose passions
 included micro housing, cats, survival, travel, living off almost nothing, and rapidly coming
 up with conspiracy theories. If only he'd been born later or the interwebs
 invented sooner, this man could have been an internet superstar. Whatever the case, Kaysing’s death understandably
 garnered a mixed reaction from the scientific community, with few finding the ability to
 muster much sympathy for a man who accused NASA of murdering people. Gone but not forgotten, Kaysing's ideas have
 actually gained in popularity in recent years, particularly among younger generations according
 to various polls, such as one done by space consultant Mary Dittmar in 2005 showing that
 25% of people 18-25 doubted man had ever walked on the moon. This is all despite the fact that it's never
 been easier to definitively debunk Kaysing's various assertions. Not just via reading the countless explanations
 by scientists definitively addressing point by point every idea ever put forth by moon
 landing conspiracy theorists, there's also the fact that there are literally pictures
 taken in the last decade showing clear evidence of some of the equipment sitting on the moon,
 including for the Apollo 11, 14, 15, 16, and 17 landing sites. Even in some cases showing the tracks left
 by the astronauts and the shadows from the flags planted themselves. Naturally, moon landing deniers simply claim
 these photos too were faked, although why China, India, and Japan should cater to NASA
 on this one when they independently took pictures of their own verifying the moon landings is
 anybody's guess. We'll have much, much more on all this in
 an upcoming article on How Do We Know Man Really Walked on the Moon?"

 Reviewer: Denise RQ OK. stand there, there, there. You've got a circle for me? Hi everybody, my name
 is Ben Mezrich, and I'm an author. I'm here to talk about UFOs. But I'll talk about how I got to UFOs because my parents get very upset
 when I just talk about UFOs. I'm a non-fiction writer. I never really wanted to be
 a non-fiction writer. I hated non-fiction growing up. I loved TV, really bad TV, like ""Saved by the Bell""
 and ""Three's Company."" My parents, fearing the worst,
 made a rule when we were little that we had to read two books a week
 before we were allowed to watch TV so I became a speed reader
 so that I could watch ""Three's Company."" When I graduated from college,
 I realized I wanted to be a writer. I locked myself in an apartment
 in Boston nearby here, and I wrote nine novels in a year; not something I recommend to any of you. I was rejected by everyone in publishing. I got 190 rejection slips
 - had them taped to the walls -; I look like a serial killer
 in my apartment. I was even rejected
 by a janitor at a publishing house because I wrote manuscript and sent it to an editor
 who was no longer working there. They got thrown in the trash. An editor took it out the trash
 and then rejected me. So it seemed unnecessary,
 but that's what happened. I went on and on and on,
 and eventually, I found my way, because I was hanging out in a bar
 in Boston called ""Crossroads"" - Some of you may know ""Crossroads"" - and there was a group of MIT kids there,
 and they had tons of money. And it was all in 100 dollar bills. I didn't know why they had
 all this money in 100s. So I met the main guy; he invited me
 to his apartment in the South End, and in his laundry was 250,000 dollars. I said, ""Are you a drug dealer?""
 And he said, ""No."" He said, ""Come to Vegas with me."" I went to Vegas, and that turned out
 to be the lead of the MIT blackjack team. I joined the team, and I wrote a book,
 and it became the movie ""21."" ""21"" was about to come out,
 I was sitting at home, and I got a weird little email
 from a Harvard senior, and it said, ""My best friend founded Facebook,
 and no one's ever heard of him."" Another weird little moment in my life: I go out for a drink
 and in walks Eduardo Saverin; - you've seen the movie - kinda looks like the guy in the movie,
 not as good-looking. if you watched 21, it was the best looking
 group of MIT kids you've ever seen. ""Social Network"" was the best looking
 Harvard kid you've ever seen. Anyways, Eduardo walks in, sits down,
 and says, ""Mark Zuckerberg fucked me."" As a journalist, I had to say,
 ""Tell me more!"" And that became the movie
 ""The Social Network."" So that's the kind of things
 I normally write. About a year and half ago,
 I heard about another story. It was about a guy named Chuck Zukowski. Chuck was a reserve sheriff's deputy
 in Colorado. Chuck was investigating
 a cattle mutilation. Out here in Massachusetts, we don't know
 a lot about cattle mutilations, but in the West,
 they are an enormous problem: over 10,000 cows and horses
 have been found lying on their left side, missing organs, all of of the cuts
 are surgical and circular, and bodies are
 completely drained of blood. This has been going on since the 60s. It's such a huge phenomenon,
 that in the 70s, three state governors got together, petitioned the Attorney General
 of the United States and demanded an investigation. The FBI investigated,
 involving 100 agents over 10 years, and found nothing. No one's ever been arrested, there's not a single fingerprint,
 not a single footprint, these cows are just found lying there,
 missing all their organs. It's really weird. Our sheriff's deputy, Chuck,
 was investigating this, and he starts to think, ""UFOs."" He was immediately fired
 from the Sheriff's Department. This is what normally happens
 when you say UFOs. Anyways, he decided
 to become a UFO hunter. He got an RV, filled it with his family, and started going up and down
 the Midwest looking for UFOs. His family didn't believe,
 his wife is a total skeptic. I interviewed her, and I said,
 ""How did you put up with this?"" And she said, ""Well, it could be worse!
 He could be off having affairs. He's just in the mountains
 looking for aliens!"" So anyways, he starts
 to make a weird discovery. Turns out that the majority
 of UFO sightings occur along the 37th parallel
 of the United States. It also turns out most cattle mutilation
 are along the 37th parallel. It also turns out that almost all
 of America's underground military bases are along the 37th parallel
 of the United States: The Pentagon, Cheyenne Mountain,
 Fort Knox, all the way over to Area 51. Chuck is investigating UFOs. He starts to have weird run-ins. You would think he's having run-ins
 with the government because the government used to
 investigate UFOs in this country. There was something
 called Project Blue Book. After that, there were
 two other secret projects, but the government
 no longer investigates UFOs. It turns out Chuck was having run-ins
 with a private corporation. This is true, and this is where we are
 going down the rabbit hole a little bit. There's a company run by a billionaire
 named Robert Bigelow. Robert Bigelow made his money
 from Budget Suites of America. He then put most of his fortune
 into something called Bigelow Aerospace. - You might heard of it - They have pieces
 on the International Space Station. They make something
 called the TransHab with NASA which is an inflatable gasket
 that astronauts can live in. They are intending one day
 to build hotels on the Moon. - It was their original project. Anyway, this is a real company. It turns out for the past 20 years,
 they have been investigating UFOs. They're doing this in conjunction with
 certain government organizations. If you get a copy of an FAA manual
 that all of our civilian pilots use, and you look through it,
 deep into the writing, what a pilot's supposed to do
 if they see something in the air, they don't report it to the FAA; they don't report to their airline
 because then they will be fired; they report it to Bigelow. Bigelow gets all this information. He sends out a well-paid for teams
 of investigators who investigate UFOs. Chuck started having run-ins with them. He didn't really know what was going on. The story comes to a head at Roswell,
 as all UFO stories do. If you know anything
 about Roswell, it's very kitschy, you can go there now and eat a hamburger
 in an UFO-shaped restaurant or go to the alien ball,
 dressed as your favorite Wookie. But the reality is the story
 behind Roswell is fascinating. In 1947, America's first nuclear base was
 there: it's called Walker Air Force Base. They started to track something
 coming through a storm in the middle of the night in July. Whatever that thing was, it was hit by lighting
 and crashed on a ranch in Roswell. It's spread metallic debris
 over 300 yards of this ranch. The metallic debris was covered
 in weird hieroglyphics, it was made of the material
 that people couldn't identify. The rancher sees all this crap
 on his lawn, he calls up the sheriff, the sheriff calls the Air Force Space. They send out a team. The team gathers up the debris
 and then puts out a press release. The press release
 from the US Air Force says, ""We now have
 in our possession a flying saucer."" This is true. Two hours later,
 they rescind their press release. They gather up all the material, they go for inch by inch
 and gather it all up, they put it on a plane,
 first they land in Dallas, where they stage a photograph with a radar operator sitting amongst
 the debris of a broken weather balloon. Everyone who was involved
 in that photograph has since come forward
 and said it was fake. The person who took the photograph,
 the person in the photograph, and the person who ordered it. Anyways, the debris was then carted
 to Area 51 where it is to this day. For whatever reason, the Air Force
 will not release the files on this crash. Hillary Clinton, a few month ago,
 was on Jimmy Kimmel, and she said
 if she were elected president, one of the first things she would do was get the Air Force
 to release the UFO files. Sadly, that is not to be. (Laughter) I don't know if she was trying to go
 for the UFO vote with that. I don't think there was enough UFO people
 to get over her over the edge. Every president we've had,
 with the possible exception of Obama, has believed in UFOs and has tried
 to get these files released. Jimmy Carter believed,
 Ronald Reagan believed, Bill Clinton tried twice to get
 these files released and couldn't. Hillary wanted to do it, we don't know
 whether Trump will or not. These files do exist. For whatever reason, the government
 will not show us what was at Roswell. I've seen documents which say it's still,
 to this day, an unidentified debris. That's very strange.
 This was a long, long time ago. So anyways, I dove into this story
 about the 37th parallel, and I have come to believe
 that there is a very good chance that whatever crashed at Roswell
 was not from here. As I said, my parents hate me saying that, because the reality is when you talk
 about UFOs, there's a giggle factor. Everyone assumes you are nuts. A respected sheriff
 can't look at a crash site and say it's an UFO without getting fired. A journalist can't talk about UFOs without hearing X-Files music
 in the background. And no scientist can look into it with the possible exception of the people
 that Robert Bigelow has hired. But we don't know what they are doing
 with the materials they find. So I want to leave you with this: the impediments to believing
 someone has come here from another planet, have actually disappeared. We used to think
 there wasn't life out there, right? Now we are all pretty sure
 there probably is. We find an Earth-like planet
 almost every day. We used to think these planets
 are too far away, right? But we now know that's not true, Proxima Centauri, which is
 one of these planets is reachable by current
 technology in 40 years. That's not that long. So, those two reasons
 aren't around anymore. The Catholic Church recently
 put out a weird little edict where they said, ""If we do
 discover life on other planets, it will not affect Catholic doctrine."" (Laughter) I think they're covering
 their basis, right? But I think that there's a sea change
 going on in the opinions of whether or not there's
 life on other planets and whether or not
 they could come here. And to be honest, looking at the news
 that we are seeing every day, if a UFO landed
 on the White House lawn tomorrow, it wouldn't even be
 the top five strange things in the newspaper today. Anyways, thank you very much.
 I appreciated it. Thank you. (Applause)"

Christopher C Kraft jr. just came back into the control center after having attended a meeting by management people in one of the back rooms and the situation is go for landing well have anything went on prior you do have a go for another try here at the PDI on rep 16 once more they would pass behind the moon and on the next revolution John Young and Charlie Duke would start their swift descent to the Dover ok looks like we gonna be able to make it God is not too many blocks up there lie on your go for landing yeah alright right down looks pretty good living doing around that comes the shadow okay down at 350 feet down it for anyone to pick up takes it down vampire can attack from a letter down to level off center on down a step six percent twenty fat contact stop the original plan had called for young and Duke to get out and explore shortly after landing however the near of board had lasted six hours the tired astronauts would sleep April 21 mission commander John Young stepped onto the decart formation 11:58 a.m. Eastern Standard Time sixteen is called while their activities were monitored by Mission Control young and Duke were also observed by scientists located across the hall in the science support room after unloading the rover from its storage Bay in the lunar module they planted the flag and any old flag there we go young set up an ultraviolet camera to provide the first astronomical observations from the moon he took pictures of the Earth's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere and their interaction with the solar wind he also photographed the interstellar gas present throughout space and the ultraviolet halos that appear around galaxies astronomers have long wanted a telescope on the moon perhaps this experiment would show the moon and ideal base for future astronomical observations you want to pan deep drilled a hole into which a heat flow probe was to be placed part of one of the experiments attached to this station as Duke drilled young set up the Central Station and the remainder of the experiments then what many considered the biggest disappointment of the mission that franca crater we saw back there the lamp charlie what don't a peer I don't know give the line to pull those oh that's the heat flow pull it off territory they knowed it I didn't even know it that means you've got to got some mates all those wires numbered wires in there and have a mess waited for another address crossing and if that doesn't occur world of chances of short announcement Central Station well that's another one that they're working on earth they tried to figure a way to fix the heat flow on the moon the astronauts continued with the other experiments young placed a series of sensors in the soil then fired explosive charges mapping the lunar subsurface much as geologists on earth use explosives to search for oil they continue to sample the area and activate the experiments then they return to the rover and prepared for their first trip away from the landing site in search for geological samples here we go their first Traverse would take them about 1 kilometre west of the landing site they would make two stops to collect samples and conduct experiments god you're beautiful that is the most beautiful sight you there young used a portable instrument to measure the local magnetic field he would later record the most intense magnetic field ever found on the moon far higher than scientists ever suspected as you come around there there's a rock in the near field on this rim that has some height on the top of it we'd like you to pick it up at the grab sample that's it you got it right there ok we coming back there would be one more stop before they got back to the lunar module to close out this EBA with Guk acting as photographer and young as driver they put the rover through a full test you're really bad is he on the ground at all that's in kilometers he's got about two wheels on the ground okay Kurt shark I have noted guys okay it is sharpie hey that's right he's a big rooster tail at all four wheels and in deterred he scared the backend breaks loose just like on so come on back John ate a deckhand on him then out day and he's never seen a driver like this okay when he hits the craters and starts bouncing is when he gets his rooster tail he makes sharp turn then it was back to their lunar base activate experiments and close out Evie a1 be wise exercise their right physical fitness level hey that's right don't take pictures of the joy below residue high-protein diet on earth the scientists took a break tomorrow would be another busy day April 22nd the lunar surface temperature of the Sun should be around 135 degrees today today they were headed a little over four kilometres south to climb their Rover up the side of Stone Mountain and we are really going up a hill I'll take their first station a crater 700 feet above their lunar module I have never seen how I can please exactly I know you're sick of that word but that's my vocabulary so ammidon how do you do we got that rate soil we got a certainly something you could go to one man family and maybe do it they would make a total of six stops on this Traverse collecting samples from large rocks down through the intermediates to the smallest soil particles they would operate experiments measuring the strength of local magnetic fields to measuring the resistance of the soil to compaction we come a long way hey time 53 go straight across that was fun I am a troll okay I'm walking up there the sampling time used up it was time to return to the rover we head back to the lunar module and they did it in two minutes less travel time entertainment pre-plan fantastic Hilary how about an extension you got we feelin good dad all we could do not fear a talk but with the limited oxygen and water in the backpacks it was finally time to close out Evie a two now I think they're realized that it's not more well gee whiz like my friends a thrill but it's real exploration and it is much more serious and much more important for the future of mankind than just a plane exploit to technical or technological exploit this is exploration Ray Bradbury claims that what mankind sees in the exploration of space is his first chance of immortality since he's since he invented religion about April 23rd the decision had been made not to try and fix the broken heat flow experiment because of the time and complexities involved for verse number 3 today young and Duke would head north about five kilometres to North Bay crater the largest lunar crater to be sampled by men I'm standing hey Tony it seems to me this is a more subdued surface over here than going towards South right oh the tax was just spectacular Wow veritable I gotta keep on the crop that's great yeah Jack that's a good point to remember all three crews now attend Oh picture there before they get back I remember and everything has people they did sixty degrees now I'd say I can't fee to the bottom of it how much quote the agent I've gotta get that now that I'm team if anything on the moon can recall that test khalaq photograph keep moving time is precious on the moon did Ed Whitacre can you get around think here you get permanently shattered soil how about rolling that one over no way then one of the most spectacular discoveries of the mission look at the five that it is a big hit it makes further away than we think play we'll just right behind you and we better press on for the big boulder okay we're headed that way you get the tongue huh yeah I carry the rake big black dog fantastic right here if we compete at the bottom we could say we hear this big black rock is right out of the bottom but my gets a bill photographed is probably if okay that sound like a good curious what they're gonna look like when they stand next to pitch we can see I get to figure yeah yeah but look at the Prairie Shattuck Park Charlie on this side over here and it's our crews Foley's father disappeared into the sunset you're right there look over to write it all off free good yeah no yeah we careful we got it I can't even okay let's go out back and we encourage you just to look for some variety yeah but now it was time to head back to their base and close out the EBA alright we think you could just about to head south now don't worry that's it record home again home again jiggety-jig during the previous EBA a section of a rear fender had come off the rover causing the astronauts to receive occasional showers of lunar dirt young parked the rover then moved out to join to enter the lunar module and prepare for liftoff absolutely incredible smile FAO don't be mad we'll get it up there see how nice and leisurely it's been that's why it should be getting ready for a sale James I could put arrived for a ride picked over top nine together in orbit the two spacecraft pirouette it each inspecting the other mass maneuvers have made all time the inspections complete the command module and lunar module maneuvered to docking Hitler John Young Ken Mattingly and Charlie Duke reunited aboard the command module settled down for tomorrow's tasks jettisoned the lunar module and burn out of orbit to come home April 25 Ken Mattingly left the confines of the command module cabin 173 thousand miles from Earth as he orbited the moon he had not only made visual observations he had been operating a complex series of experiments many of these had returned instant data to Houston two had taken thousands of high-resolution pictures of the lunar terrain now Mattingly retrieved the film canisters and made his way back to the cabin with them as Charlie Duke stood in the hatch to help him work it had been quite a mission in John Young's words make me cleaners but it at that day that most people had lifetime April 27 the last day the crew looked out their windows through the 5,000 degree fireball of reentry at their native planet that is beautiful now they're blooming you barely argue Apollo control Houston an observer on the Ticonderoga estimates a distance from the ship about to one mile Oh now you saw an example of goal-oriented teamwork in action the kind of thing that made this country great and the kind of thing that's going to keep it that way real smooth Shaw every bit of it yeah yeah right Amanda well done young man outstanding hi can I fetch that cigar anymore I cannot Oh Mike yeah you you"

Apollo 13 is a 1995 American docudrama space adventure film directed by Ron Howard. The film stars Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, and Ed Harris. The screenplay by William Broyles, Jr., and Al Reinert, that dramatizes the aborted 1970 Apollo 13 lunar mission, is an adaptation of the book Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 by astronaut Jim Lovell and Jeffrey Kluger.
The film depicts astronauts Lovell, Jack Swigert, and Fred Haise aboard Apollo 13 for America's third Moon landing mission. En route, an on-board explosion deprives their spacecraft of most of its oxygen supply and electric power, forcing NASA's flight controllers to abort the Moon landing, and turning the mission into a struggle to get the three men home safely.",History Buffs: Apollo 13,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjCOMJDULaE,-1,1788288,38876,898,7374,zjCOMJDULaE,"hello and welcome history buffs my name is Nick Hodges and in this very special episode to celebrate reaching over 250,000 subscribers will be leaving the confines of our planet and venturing far out into space onboard Apollo 13 it's April 1970 less than a year has passed since Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon on Apollo 11 since then Apollo 12 made an equally successful landing and NASA is now launched Apollo 13 also intended to land on the moon but 56 hours later and over 200,000 miles from Earth an unforeseen accident occurs that jeopardizes the lives the entire crew this film is based on the true story of what those astronauts went through and the collaborative effort of Mission Control to bring them back home alive and over the course of this review I'll be discussing in great length the history of the space race I'll be covering Apollo 13 mission and finally discuss how faithful was the film to what actually happened this is Apollo 13 isn't it super awesome that we now live in a time where we can look back on our own history and know that we have traveled into space not only that but we have walked on the surface of the Moon the very celestial body that every single human being that has ever lived has gazed upon it truly does capture the imagination and not the long ago such an idea only existed in the realm of science fiction in 1865 Jules Verne published the book from the earth to the moon and got remarkably close to how it actually happened just over a century later for the Apollo 8 mission in 1968 for example he decided that out of all the nations on earth that America would be the one to do it and through his calculations he predicted that the launch site would be in southern Florida he predicted there would be in the month of December there would take three days to travel to the moon and that the capsule would return to Earth by being recovered at sea the only big thing he got wrong was that in real life a rocket was used whilst the Americans in his book used a giant cannon but even so it's pretty amazing on how much he was able to get right so the question stands how did the romantic idea of traveling to the moon make the transition from science fiction to science fact well the roots of mankind's greatest journey can be found at the end of World War two in September 1944 and Hitler is desperate to find a solution in winning the war that was when he unleashed a new secret weapon the v2 rocket the world's first ballistic missile packed with explosives the Vita's were launched against allied cities such as Paris Antwerp and London although a terrifying weapon it's important to note that this was the first man-made object to cross the boundary of space before falling back to earth and hitting its targets and this was certainly not lost on the German rocket scientists who developed it his name was Werner von Braun his life's work had always been in the pursuit of space travel and with his rocket technology he was convinced that it was the key - reaching the heavens in fact you could say he was pretty much obsessed with this and all other potential moral ambiguities were considered secondary for example later in life when he was questioned about his v2 rockets he's quoted as saying the rocket worked perfectly except for landing on the wrong planet so when he joined the Nazi Party in 1937 he saw it as a career move one that would get him all the funding he would ever need to realize his dream in the final days of the war the Allies and the Soviets were pushing further and further into Germany secretly both sides were searching for von Braun as they could see the terrible potential his weapons had particularly the Americans as they were already developing their own super weapon at the time if von Braun's rocket technology could be combined with the atomic bomb it would be the most destructive weapon in history neither the Americans nor the Soviets knew it yet but they had just taken the first steps and what eventually became the space race now von Braun was perfectly aware that the Third Reich's days were numbered and if he wished to continue pursuing his dream of space travel it would have to be elsewhere especially since he knew that the Nazi officers who are protecting him and his team were under orders to shoot him if it looked like he was going to fall in enemy hands so obviously he had to escape and weighed his options on who to surrender to the Soviets were the less desirable choice since it was well known how they treated their prisoners only real option was to surrender to the Americans and after has escaped that's exactly what he did in exchange for his full cooperation and knowledge of the beatty rocket program von Braun will be given full immunity and was whisked away to the United States with von Braun out of their reach the Soviets now had to play catch-up by scavenging abandoned v2 rocket factories and finding other German rocket engineers who had been left behind in East Germany they would also recruit one man to take von Braun's position as chief designer in their rocket program and that man sergei korolev now he had been falsely imprisoned during the Great Purge under acts of sabotage in the Soviets rocket Research Institute and was sentenced to ten years in one of Stalin's gulags in 1945 he was released after serving six years of his ten-year sentence by recommendation from one of the very men who had denounced him in the first place his old colleague Valentin Glushko now I'm sure glushko felt incredibly awkward about the whole situation but he was smart enough to know that sergei korolev was the man for the job not only was he an innovator a genius but for all intents and purposes he would become von Browns rival and ultimately his equal especially since they both shared the same dream of space travel on August 6 1945 the world was stunned when America dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima this only served to strengthen Soviet resolve because not only do the Americans possess the a-bomb now but von Braun and his Rockets just a month before this however a Soviet spy called Klaus Fuchs who had been working on the Manhattan Project stole classified blueprints of the atom bomb and send them to Moscow on the 2nd of July 1945 once the Soviets witnessed the atomic bombs true destructive power in hiroshima and nagasaki stalin immediately ordered that their own bombs be built as well as continued developing their rocket technology the Soviets were under the natural assumption that the next logical step for America would be to build missiles fitted with their atomic weapons but surprisingly that wasn't the case von Braun and his team weren't continuing their research the Americans were quite happy to let their department collect dust preferring to instead entrust future delivery of the bombs be made by planes just like they had done in Japan that was until they got their wake-up call on the 29th of August 1949 the first Soviet atomic bomb was detonated on a test site in Sammy patents Kazakhstan this time the West was horrified especially with how quickly the Soviet Union was able to do it and just a month later on the 25th of September 1949 the Soviets had successfully launched an improved version of the v2 rocket which they dubbed the r2 it had twice the range of the b2 and was capable of hitting England 1949 was significant because a marked the beginning of the nuclear arms race between America and the Soviet Union each side working furiously to develop nuclear weapons capable of destroying each other and much of the time they spent doing so was very neck-and-neck on November 1st 1952 the Americans tested the world's first hydrogen bomb in the Pacific Ocean on the 12th of August 1953 the Russians develop an h-bomb of their own and tested in Kazakhstan now some of you may be asking what does all this have to do with space travel well the development of the rocket technology necessary for space travel can only have been achieved with military funding so when Sergei Korolev was asked if he could build a new rocket that can transport a thermonuclear warhead to America he said yes he could because he knew that same rocket could also reach space and auto transport and launch a satellite and Earth's orbit the funding he got from the Soviet Union was exactly what he needed to make that happen in America however von Braun was having a much harder time selling the idea to the US Army I was hardly getting any funding at all for his rockets so what he decides to do instead and I find this very funny by the way is to go over the Army's head and instead sell the idea of spaceflight and traveling to the moon directly to the American people how does he do this well through Walt Disney of course here to reveal a plan for a trip around the moon is a chief of the guided missile development at the United States Army's Redstone Arsenal dr. Wernher Braun a voyage around the moon must be made in two phases a rocket ship taking off from the Earth's surface will use almost all the fuel it can carry just to attain a speed great enough to balance the pull of gravity unpowered it will then keep circling the earth in an orbit outside of the atmosphere this is the first phase however if we can refuel the ship in this orbit with fuel brought up by cargo rocket ships it can set out on the second phase the trip around the moon and back this televised primetime event may dr. Wernher von Braun a household name has 40 million Americans we're glued to their screens von Browns plan absolutely worked as things began to get moving in Washington that would later help him get the funding he needed for his Rockets what did we learn today guys when someone tells you not to follow your dreams don't just accept it it might very well happen if you keep at it so anyway back in the Soviet Union Sergei Korolev was also watching how things were developing in America anxious to get his own satellite into orbit first he works furiously on his r7 rocket Nikita Khrushchev the leader of the Soviet Union told Carla that if the r7 worked then he would be allowed to fit the next launch with a satellite after several failures the r7 was finally able to launch successfully on August 21st 1957 and travelled 3700 miles going further than any rocket before and capable of hitting America Sergei Korolev can now proceed with his satellite which they called Sputnik now the satellite itself was very simple in design it was just a relatively small ball about 22 and a half inches in diameter with for long radio antenna it was stripped down to only the bare essentials in orders make it light enough to be carried by the r7 all it needed to do was to transmit a radio signal proving to the world of his success on the 4th of October 1957 the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 the first man-made satellite into orbit and the world took notice today a new moon is in the sky a 23 inch metal sphere placed in orbit by a Russian rocket here an artist's conception of how the feat was accomplished a three-stage rocket number one the booster in the class of an intercontinental missile its weight estimated at 50 tons the smaller second stage took over at five thousand miles an hour and carried on to the highest point reached 500 miles up the artificial moon is boosted to a speed counter balancing the pull of gravity and released you are hearing the actual signals transmitted by the earth circling satellite one of the great scientific feats of the age this was it this was the moment that officially started the space race it was the kick of the proverbial backside America needed to get them in the game its public was awash with different emotions some of them were excited with this scientific breakthrough while others were even frightened guess the American people alarmed that a foreign country especially an enemy country can do this if we fear this but more than fear more than excitement the biggest thing Sputnik did was sting America's pride and they couldn't let that slide however whilst America was rushing in with her own satellite the Russians were already thinking one step ahead on November 3rd 1957 Sputnik 2 was launched but this was no mere satellite onboard a carried a dog called Leica the first living creature into space the purpose of the experiment was to see if an animal or eventually a human could survive the stress of leaving Earth's atmosphere it was a complete success although rather sadly Lika only survived for five hours in Earth's orbit if was succumbing to heat exhaustion many people were outraged that the Soviets didn't even attempt to come up with a way to bring her back down beforehand regardless it was clear to everyone that the Cold War would not only take place on earth but in outer space and four years Wernher von Braun had been fighting to make his voice heard in the military but bureaucracy and politics had always stood in his way now that the Russians were in space they were starting to pay attention he would get his chance to go ahead with launching his satellite but he had to wait for some stupid reason for the Navy to have first dibs the Vanguard TV 3 was America's first attempt to launch a satellite on December 6th 1957 and as you can see here at fail spectacular if the Navy was sloppy and they rushed it the Americans hoping to have a little bit of their pride restored instead became a laughingstock to the Soviet Union premier Khrushchev hit them with a sick burn saying the United States sleeps under a Soviet moon so since the Navy cocked up their chance Wernher von Braun finally got the go-ahead on the 31st of January 1958 Explorer 1 was launched without incident and like Sputnik this American satellite would collect scientific data from space the success of Explorer 1 cannot be understated as a loud von Braun to have all the funding he would need on July 29th 1958 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would be formed NASA would take the charge in winning the space race for America and less than a year later they announced Project Mercury at a press conference introducing a plan to put the first American into space meanwhile the Soviets were still making headline news by sending probes to the moon as part of their lunar program on October 7th 1959 one of these probes call Luna 3 sent back photographs and for the first time in history humans can now see what the dark side of the moon looks like but this was still more of a sideshow as the Soviets were also planning to put a man into space after an intensive training program the man who would be chosen for this the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on the 12th of April 1961 the Vostok 1 rocket was launched carrying Yuri 17,500 miles an hour each step of the way another booster rocket would drop off as he went higher and higher and higher the g-force pressing up against his body until the final rocket stage shut down and Vostok one reached orbit and like flicking a switch the g-force was gone I was replaced with weightlessness and then Yuri looked out the window of his capsule and became the first human being to ever see the Earth from space after just over an hour in orbit the Vostok re-entered Earth's atmosphere and as the first man to orbit the Earth Yuri Gagarin received a hero's welcome winning many medals and titles including being awarded by premier khrushchev hero of the soviet union which was the highest honor of the nation he also became an international celebrity as he traveled all over the globe doing interviews about his historic adventure promoting the Soviet Union's superiority in space to the Americans however it was another crushing blow to the national pride and despite their own great accomplishment of putting Alan Shepard the first American into space less than a month later it still wasn't enough NASA always seemed to be just one step behind the Soviets and John F Kennedy the American president decided that being in second place just wasn't going to cut it anymore instead of trying to catch up to the Soviets he would shift NASA's attention to focus on the end goal in one of the greatest speeches of all time he publicly announced that America would have put a man on the moon before the end of the decade why some say the moon why choose this as our goal and they may we'll ask why climb the highest mountain why 35 years ago fly the Atlantic why does Rice play Texas we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win good god I love that man now that was a president whatever his real political motivations may have been supporting all of this it can't be denied that his passion and perseverance to get the American people and Congress behind NASA changed everything they got better funding better resources and the Apollo program was started shortly afterwards with the goal to put Americans on the moon this was the tipping point where things would begin to turn in America's favor it's just such a shame he didn't live to see it unfortunately for Sergei Korolev he would get nowhere near the same kind of support from his government for his planned mission to the moon he was mostly expected to just work with what he had and most the technology wasn't as advanced as what the Americans had even after completing yet another historic achievement by having Alexei Leonov be the first man to spacewalk outside his capsule on the 18th of March 1965 the real reason why is because the Soviet Union just saw the space race is yet another propaganda tool and they weren't terribly interested in its scientific advancements the funding he was given instead was just a fraction of what he really needed over the coming months NASA was sending more and more manned missions into space the formics spacewalks of their own and doing docking procedures all of the necessary steps to prepare for that trip to the moon at last the Americans were beginning to overtake the Soviets but the worst blow to the Soviet space program came on the 14th of January 1966 when tragically Sergei Korolev died this was brought about from a kidney disorder he had picked up during his time in the gulag and his health had been deteriorating due to the stress of his space missions the doctors had previously warned him about this when he had first heart attack in 1962 back down from his work otherwise they couldn't guarantee that he would live for much longer but Sergei persevere despite this risk fearing that Khrushchev would cancel the Soviet space program altogether such was his commitment to space exploration sad to say but Korolev's death worked in NASA's favor von Browns only true rival was now out of the picture and they no longer had to truly concern themselves with the Soviets catching up and then on December 21st 1968 just over a hundred years after Jules Verne published his book from the earth to the moon NASA launched Apollo 8 onboard with 3 astronauts William Anders Frank Borman and Jim Lovell this time they were leaving Earth and flying straight to the moon traveling 234,000 miles going further than any human being had ever gone before their six-day mission would be to orbit the moon and return safely entering its orbit they became the first human beings to ever look down on the lunar surface with the naked eye but even more incredible was that as they made their way around its dark side William Anders grabbed a camera and recorder a truly spectacular sight the earth rising over the moon's horizon two more missions would follow and still the Soviets were nowhere close to catching up with a manned mission of their own and then a year later the day finally came on July 16th 1969 the world held its breath as Apollo 11 was launched carrying Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins to the moon this was the mission the mission that would achieve Wernher von Braun's lifelong dream a fulfill a promise made by NASA and John F Kennedy to land men on the moon before the end of the decade four days later Apollo 11 enter the moon's orbit as Michael Collins stayed behind in the command module Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin descended down to the surface on the lunar module back on earth half a billion people were watching every step of the way marking it as one of the biggest televised events in history Neil Armstrong opened the hatch and began making his way down the ladder then he said those immortal words have no glamour it's one small step for man one giant leap for me you true to his words john f kennedy's proposal to land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth before the end of the decade had finally been achieved however nasa wasn't quite done yet and would continue with further missions after Apollo 11 came Apollo 12 another successful moon landing a took place on November 24th 1969 now originally NASA had a budget for ten moon landings but despite how successful Apollo 11 was there are politicians pressuring them to cut costs people in my state have been asking why we're continuing to fund this program now that we beat the Russians to the moon as a result of people like this by the time Apollo 13 was scheduled to launch on April 11th 1970 the ten moon landings were to be cut down to nine and it's aftermath would cut down even more and this is obviously where the movie begins the crew selected for Apollo 13 was Fred Haise the lunar module pilots played by Bill Paxton Ken Mattingly the command module pilot played by Gary Sinise and finally Jim Lovell the commander played by Tom Hanks now a cool thing to note about Jim Lovell is that by this point he was the world's most traveled astronauts with 572 hours of spaceflight with three missions under his belt including Apollo 8 the first manned mission to orbit the moon now he would get the opportunity to land on it however just a few days before the mission launch the first bit of bad luck came when Ken Mattingly was exposed to German measles as a precaution NASA replaced him with the backup command module pilot Jack Swagger's played by Kevin Bacon now some people use this last-minute replacement as yet another example of the superstitious bad luck looming over the mission all just because it was the thirteenth Apollo mission and 13 is seen as an unlucky number I'm glad to see that the movie accurately points out that the folks over at NASA aren't exactly a superstitious Bunch I'm gonna walk on the bone marrow that's really it's 1313 he comes after 12 hun by the way I'm happy to say that Maryland's initial nervousness about the mission and is having bad luck because of the number thirteen is authentically depicted in the movie even more so when it's reinforced by this little moment with Maryland's wedding ring that really did take place a day before the launch I was taking a shower and I it just slipped right off my hand and it went into the drain and I just was terrified because to me it was like an omen that something really was going to happen now I'm not exactly a superstitious guy but I do think it's kind of funny how NASA was almost tempting fate and that's because Apollo 13 was scheduled to launch on April 11th 1970 at 13 past 1:00 or in military lingo 13 13 the reason for this was simply just because the timing presented the most optimal conditions that day NASA was treating it like any other mission and aside from a bumpy start with one of the engines had liftoff that was quickly corrected everything was above board and just routine it's nothing routine about flying to the moon I could write for that I totally agree with you main unfortunately the public at the time didn't see it that way the thing is by Apollo 13 people were so used to NASA landing men on the moon that they were just bored by it apparently they found it so boring that no news network wanted to show Apollo 13s live TV broadcast all the network's dumped us well don't say we made gone to the moon about as exciting as taking a trip to Pittsburgh now I understand that the Beatles broke up the day before and yes that was headline news but seriously how lame is that I can't help but feel a little annoyed at how good everyone had it back then and it's sad to think that arguably the most memorable thing that NASA has done since the Apollo program is this control to Major Tom you really anyway about six minutes after their live TV broadcast which nobody watched Mission Control asked Jack Swagger's to stir the hydrogen and oxygen tanks in the service module hey we've got a fat one here what did you do nothing let's do the text what's the crew of Apollo 13 a Mission Control didn't know at the time was that the insulation covering the wires inside oxygen tank number two had accidentally melted off during a dress rehearsal a few weeks before so when Jack Swagger's flipped the switch a spark from an exposed wire caused a fire and ignited the highly concentrated oxygen tanks back in Mission Control the readings on their computers were going off the chart when they received that famous radio message houston we have a problem now that famous line was actually shortened in the movie what was actually said was with all the confusion Mission Control thought the problem had to be instrumental since so many things were going wrong at once whilst the Apollo 13 crew thought they had been hit by a meteor this was just for the first few minutes until Jim Lovell looked at the window we are venting something out in the space this was extremely bad the oxygen supply wasn't just used for breathing was also mixed with the hydrogen in the fuel cells to generate water and power one tank was completely depleted and the second was bleeding oxygen very quickly in order to hold the flow Houston decided that the reactant feed valve from the two fuel cells had to be closed and when they gave the order to Apollo 13 it crushed them because it could only mean one thing we just lost the moon the reason why was because once they had shut down those valves they couldn't be turned back on again they also knew that they needed to fuel cells to land on the moon what little oxygen they had left was in the command module small reserve tank but the real problem wasn't that they could no longer land on the moon but if they can make it back home alive the command module by this point would be out of oxygen and power within minutes to conserve as much as they could for reentry in Earth's atmosphere they had to shut it down and move themselves into the lunar module or LEM and use it as a lifeboat but before they could do that they had to transfer vital data from the command modules computers onto the lems computers now the good thing about the lemmas that had its own supply of power and oxygen just in the nick of time the crew achieved everything they needed to do and moved into the LEM whilst all this was going on Apollo 13s mission was finally making headline news people all around the world watched as reports came in of how perilous the situation was there was a very real possibility that Lovell hastened Swaggart would make another record for the history books to be the first Americans to die in space but the crew didn't have the luxury all the time to contemplate their odds after they corrected their course they had to focus on the next problem with extremely limited power how could they return to Earth the only engine we've got with enough power for a direct abort is the SPS on a service module what Lovell was told us he could have been damaged in an explosion so let's consider that engine dead we like that thing up cabal the whole works just too risky so what was decided instead was to have Apollo 13 continued to the moon there they would use the moon's gravity to pull them into orbit and with a brief engine burn from the LEM it would slingshot them back to earth but there was also another issue Mission Control knew that without being able to use the engine from the service module Apollo 13 dirty back would take much longer the thing is the LEM was built to land on the moon but was designed to only support two men for two days and based on their close proximity to the moon already the lems week engine burn would instead take them four days to return to Earth meaning the very real possibility that they could run out of water power and ere long before they've reached it as Apollo 13 approached the moon's orbit the film appropriately shows this very somber scene when the astronauts look at the moon out the window coming up on Mount Maryland Jim you got to take a look at this I honestly can't even begin to imagine how gut-wrenching that must be to be that close to the moon closer than most people have ever been only to see it slip away as Apollo 13 reappeared from the far side of the Moon the crew fired the lens engine directing them to earth and then afterwards to conserve all the power they possibly could for life support communication and later for re-entry Houston told him to switch off all non-critical systems including the heating eventually got so cold in there that it was like being in a fridge the duration of their journey back to earth would be an extreme discomfort as it would be too cold to sleep and their food and water would freeze but to ensure their survival they had to do it with power consumption taking care of the next problem that had to be fixed was how to deal with the carbon dioxide building up in the spacecraft now normally they would use lithium hydroxide canisters which filter carbon dioxide to make the air breathable and they did have plenty on board from both the command module and the lunar module but there was a serious design flaw we had a co2 filter problem on the lunar module five filters on the limb which were meant for two guys for a day and a half so I told the doctor they're already up to eight on the gauges anything over 15 and you get prepared judgment blackouts the beginnings of brain asphyxia without the scrubbers in the command module it takes square cartridges ones on the limb around so the engineers back on earth using nothing with equipment available on Apollo 13 had to figure out how to fit us we're peg into a round hole amazingly a solution was found with duct tape part of a flight manual and some plastic bags they were able to direct the astronauts over the radio on how to recreate the process for the next few days Apollo 13 drifted onwards to earth as its crew struggled with freezing conditions lack of sleep and dehydration on the sixth day earth was finally beginning to fill their windows in preparation for this Houston told them a new course correction was needed as the angle they were approaching was too shallow meaning that they would skim the Earth's atmosphere and bounce off into space unfortunately they still couldn't power up their computers yet to give them a reading so they would have to fly blind and use a visual reference the Stars can be counted on as there is still a lot of debris floating outside so instead they used the earth itself keeping it in the window the whole crew had to work together by firing the lens engine for the precise duration needed as they flew manually they only had a matter of seconds to study the spacecraft as it pitched and Lord from the force of the engine just in the nick of time they had achieved the correct angle they needed the next and final step was to prepare for reentry both Mission Control and the crew had been anticipating this nervously the command module had never been powered down before in flight and whether being exposed to the cold vacuum of space for so long the main concern was whether it could even be turned back on and then there was also the issue about the build-up of condensation everything inside was absolutely covered with droplets of water from the walls the floors the ceiling and the control panels and there was a very good chance that condensation was building up behind the control panels to the possibility of a short-circuit wasn't far from everyone's mind fortunately all the systems were switched on without incident and the spacecraft came to life next they disconnected the service module and as it drifted off the crew could now see where the damage had been from the explosion reason why everyone was so concerned was that if the heat shield had been at all compromised then the astronauts would most likely burn up in Earth's atmosphere but there was nothing they could do about it only a few hours left until reentry all they could do now was hope for the best with everything ready to go the crew moved into the command module and disconnected the LEM the portion of the ship that had protected them for so long throughout the entire ordeal the command module then began to descend into the atmosphere the whole world held its breath as had watched everything unfold on the news hoping and praying that the angle was still good that the heat shield hadn't been damaged and the parachutes hadn't frozen in space the time will take for Mission Control to know if Apollo 13 had made it was calculated to be around 3 minutes reason why is because communications are temporarily disrupted in reentry within that time frame due to the extreme buildup of heat and the ionization of the gases around the spacecraft the command module roaster temperatures are 5000 degrees as it hurled towards the Earth going 25,000 miles an hour three minutes went by and still not a word seconds began to drag as the blackout continued and then after six minutes a voice emerge from the radio against all odds the crew of Apollo 13 returned safely the heat shield withstood the intense heat of reentry and the parachutes had successfully deployed the extra delay in the blackout was caught by the command module coming in at a shallower angle but otherwise they had made it they splashed down the South Pacific Ocean where the USS iwo jima was waiting for them with a rescue crew all over the world people let out a huge sigh of relief as they watched the live TV broadcast later Apollo 13 mission would be called a successful failure Jim Lovell Fred Hayes and Jack Swagger's may have been denied their chance to walk on the moon but the return home is nonetheless a true victory made possible by the extraordinary professionalism and dedication by Mission Control and each other as you all know I'm not exactly fond of inaccuracies almost every historical movie has them but most of them are justified to enhance the drama within the story sometimes it's just an excuse to cover up sloppy writing but Apollo 13 is a rare example where I happen to agree with mostly in activities presented on screen but don't get me wrong these moments are far and few between they really did do a fantastic job to try and be as faithful to the real-life story as possible but only to an extent you see if they made this particular movie to be too authentic then it really would have been boring to watch in Apollo 13s case the movie not only has to be authentic but has to convey to the audience what is going on in the simplest way possible obviously we can't understand every single thing said in the movie since we are clearly not astronauts I can't even pretend to understand the complexity of half the stuff they're talking about that's why throughout the film some of their high-tech jargon is simplified but even that sometimes is not enough because as human beings what we tend to respond to most are visuals this is the reason why the film feels like it has to almost spell things out for us so you're telling me you can only give our guys 45 hours that brings them to a bat there we gotta find a way to make this fit into the hole for this using nothing but that in all honesty I imagine that most of these guys were completely up to speed with one another and most likely talking a mile a minute but as long as we the audience gets a generally good idea of what's going on then it's absolutely justified in my opinion another thing is if we can't understand the gravity of the situation behind what's being said we can certainly pick it up by the emotions our main characters convey all I did was stir those tanks who's that gauge reading before he hit the switch you don't tell me how to fly the damn see am i right do a job ask me to stir the damn tanks and I stir the tank now just to let you know this confrontation absolutely never happened in fact there were no confrontations of any kind that took place on Apollo 13 despite the discomforts and the dangers they had to endure cooperation between the crew members was never an issue they were all in this together and focusing on anything else was just a waste of time I'm not gonna go bouncing off the walls for ten minutes and we're just gonna end up right back here with the same problems trying to figure out how to stay alive this possible suggestion of Jack Swagger being incompetent is totally fabricated in the movie I mean like how in the hell was he supposed to know that the oxygen tank was going to explode just by flipping a switch if there was even a slight chance that he wasn't up to the task do you really think he would even be in outer space to begin with these emotional outbursts that occur throughout the film obviously didn't happen but they're meant to heighten the drama and to emphasize the stress and the toll it was having all these astronauts they're freezing cold they've had no sleep and they're suffering for the throbbing headaches because of their lack of oxygen any one of us would quite naturally be bitching and moaning but the fact that these guys never did really does emphasize how they were the best of the best however in the movie we see people frequently snap at each other whether it be on board Apollo 13 or even back in Houston they're working on it now all over the simulator and get an estimate what the procedures now this is actually where history works against the movie because not once - Gene Kranz ever snap has any of his crew nor does any of the astronauts snap at Houston queries watch that middle gimbal we don't want you coming off well informed here's I'm well aware the goddamn gimbal if you actually listen to the real audio from Apollo 13 and compare it to what is portrayed in the movie then you will be amazed to discover how absolutely calm the real guys were even during the most intense scene in the entire movie houston we have a problem we have a main bus b undervolt we've got a lot of thrust arrested or accused in that we just went offline oh there's another master alarm Houston Roger man b undervolt and bio 13 we're looking at it right now go ahead up the tunnel again yeah now I swear that I didn't just look for the most boring clips I could find this is pretty much consistent with all their rushes although it doesn't sound like this very much going on they're actually performing some very nail-biting stuff the fact that Mission Control and the crew of Apollo 13 were able to keep their cool that the entire ordeal is nothing short of astonishing but I think it's fair to say that if Apollo 13 was 100% accurate with how these guys actually talked then most audience members would fall asleep instead the authenticity comes from the event scene in the movie and especially the visuals for example to get the actors to have cold breath they would freeze the set about 35 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.6 degrees Celsius there's also the re-entry sequence which I absolutely love when the command module began to heat up all the condensation dripped away the real Jim Lovell described it by saying that it rained inside the CM and in the movie we actually see it but the most authentic parts of Apollo 13 without a doubt are the zero gravity sequences and the reason why they're so convincing is because they're real during production NASA allowed the filmmakers special use of their reduced gravity aircraft the kc-135 on board the plane they had built smaller versions of the set for the actors to work in and as the plane descended sharply the cast and the crew were able to experience nearly 25 seconds of weightlessness when you're weightless it feels like you've just been spun upside down all the blood goes into your head and it feels like like giving you a rock oh plane at the amusement park it just feels like they you've just got spun upside down you think suddenly like you think hey I'm upside down no I'm not what's wrong why is it different oh I'm floating seriously how awesome is that now let's discuss some of the inaccuracies one big moment in the film is when the astronauts climb into the lunar module and use it as a lifeboat whilst the guys back in Houston racked their brains on how to make it support three men for four days instead of what it was designed to do which was two men for two days now whilst all this is true the movie does make it appear that Mission Control improvised a lot of the stuff on the fly reality NASA had already stimulated this lifeboat procedure before in that scenario they pretended that something had contaminated the atmosphere in the command module and the crew had to get into the LEM and vent everything out so during the Apollo 13 mission people already remember that exercise when everything was going badly in fact it's probably because of that these astronauts survived there was also another similar example in the film when the problem came with the carbon dioxide filters from the command module and the LEM in preparation for the Apollo 8 mission there had been another simulation where a cabin fan had been jams due to a loose screw to fix the problem they used a vacuum cleaner from the command module and some cuts of plastic bags and taped it to the lithium hydroxide canisters and blew through it with a vacuum cleaner so again during the Apollo 13 mission people were like hey do you remember that simulation we did back on eight and then of course there's the big moments in the film where it seems that Ken Mattingly single-handedly saves the day by figuring out how to find more power for the command module when this crew on 13 need to turn everything on in reality that simulation was more of a verification of an already written process a bunch of guys had already worked it out and written down the procedures to do it so the simulation was actually done to confirm whether the numbers were right knowing the truth of course shouldn't take away your enjoyment of the movie as I feel that it was necessary to condense a lot of what happened I mean you have to remember that these guys were out in space for several days and the last big inaccuracy in the movie that I can think of is when we see the crew begin to suffer the effects of carbon dioxide poisoning we see Jack Swagger's have blurry vision and he's having trouble thinking now whilst it's true that there was a buildup of co2 inside the spacecraft before they fixed the filters it was never as dangerously high as the thumb suggests otherwise the astronauts would have been unable to carry out their complicated tasks you see when you get co2 poisoning your brain is starved of oxygen and the less you have the more incapacitated you become before you eventually die from it this is just another example of the film heightening up the drama to inform the audience with his visuals the dangers out astronauts face as a historical film Apollo 13 is damn near perfect to this execution it stays as true to real-life events as it possibly can and by doing so is able to shine the light on the incredible deeds carried out by Apollo 13 and Mission Control it is indeed a tribute to this amazing period in time and mostly inaccuracies are presented in this review of in my opinion justified in the movie people may not have shattered each other they may not have been really from the effects of co2 but the stresses and the dangers they faced were very real indeed and the fact they were able to stay calm and collected throughout the entire ordeal speaks volumes about their professionalism and you can clearly see the effort mate in making this film you get a sense of a genuine enthusiasm and a great love of history so much so that literally bleeds out of the screen and this is all I want from a historical picture I just want the filmmakers to care as much about the history as I do because when they do you get a real classic on your hands people will watch it and understand why Apollo 13 is referenced as NASA's finest hour a lot of Americans who watch this film and they will feel proud not just of Apollo 13 but what their country accomplished for all of mankind in the space race as rightfully they should I also feel that sense of pride for them but I also feel a tinge of regret it's sad to think that humanity's greatest achievement landing on the moon was nearly 50 years ago half a century two thousand one has come and gone and the iPads and we have Skype was still no closer to Stanley Kubrick's vision of the future a film he made before Neil Armstrong's first steps on the moon he made it in a time when people were optimistic about what the next century would bring in interplanetary travel we still have yet to see that future the last time humanity was on another celestial body was on the moon in 1972 and I sincerely hope that within our lifetime we might return to it again well that about wraps it up my name is Nick Hodges and thanks for watching history buffs and remember if you like the show help the channel grow if

Although the USA won the race to the moon, if you’d been a betting person from the mid 1950’s to 1960’s, the chances are that you would have thought the Soviet Union had a very good chance of getting there first.

So why didn’t Russia put a man on the moon?

At the time the soviets were leading the space race, they had already started with the launch of Sputnik, then launched several probes to the moon, including one in 1959 that orbited and taken photos of the far side and By 1961 they were the first to put a man in to space.

So when Kennedy made his now famous “We choose to go to the moon” speech in 1962 to rally public support, Khrushchev’s response was silence, neither confirming nor denying that they had a plan for a manned moon mission.

But at the time Khrushchev wasn’t really interested in competing with the US over the moon, he was more interested ICBM’s the Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles for the strategic rocket forces.
But there were others that had harboured plans for manned mission for a long time, these included the man whose name was a state secret and the most powerful man outside the Kremlin when it came to space.

He was Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, outside the inner circle of the top space scientists he was known only as the “Chief Designer” or by his first 2 initials SP, because the Soviet leadership feared that the western powers would send agents to assassinate him........

 Union but there were others in the Soviet Union that had harbored plans for
 a manned moon mission for a long time these included the man whose name was a
 state secret and the most powerful man outside the Kremlin when it came to
 space he was Sergei Pavlovich Korolev, off outside the inner circle of the top
 space scientists he was known only as the ""Chief designer"" or by his first two
 initials ""SP"" because the Soviet leadership feared that the Western
 powers would send agents to try and assassinate him. Korolev was the man who was behind many of the Soviet space successes and the head of the OKB1 the design bureau, he
 oversaw Sputnik and the manned missions including the first man in space ""Yuri Gagarin"". His authority extended over
 most everything to do with space his design group worked on missions to Mars
 and Venus, communication and spy and weather satellites, ICBMs and
 the soviet manned moon missions. Korolev have had a huge amount of control over
 the space program, in administrative power he was almost a one-man version of
 NASA, covering areas that in the US were done across multiple aerospace companies
 and flight centre's but even a man of his power and connections didn't get
 everything his own way. He had to continuously fight against rival
 designers and design groups. Although Korolyev wanted the moon missions
 himself, in 1964 the job was given to his rival, Vladimir Chelomei  because of his
 patronage by Khrushchev but his lack of experience meant that the missions
 progressed slowly. The progress of Apollo on the other hand worried the chief
 designers and as a result of this and the infighting between the design
 bureaus meant that they were multiple overlapping designs for the moon
 missions at one point there were 30 different designs for launchers and
 spacecraft. In 1964 the Soviet Leader Khrushchev was replaced by Leonard
 Brezhnev, Korolev was given the complete control over the moon missions
 and pushed through his designs ahead of Chelomei’s and the decision finally to
 compete for the moon was given with the aim to land in 1967, the 50th
 anniversary of the october revolution and to get there before the Americans.
 This however created a problem for Korolev, in order to lift a payload
 weight of 95 tons he needed a very large rocket this new rocket will be called
 the N1, be as big as the American Saturn 5 and would require new large powerful engines
 similar to the F1 rocket engines used in the Saturn. Valentin Glushko was the
 leading rocket designer at the time and the head of the OKB 456 
 Bureau which had a near-monopoly when it came to rocket design and production. He
 specialized in making engines that used hypergolic propellants, these consist of
 a fuel and oxidizer that when mixed together spontaneously ignite when they
 come into contact with each other. Korolev thought these were too dangerous for manned missions due to the
 highly toxic and corrosive nature of the chemicals used to make up the fuel. Glushko said that it was not possible to create a new large engine design that
 used cryogenic fuel of liquid oxygen and kerosene and get it ready in time with
 limited resources and cash. He also cited that at the time the
 Americans had been working on cryogenic engines for the Saturn for 5 years
 and still hadn't got them to work reliably. There was also a personal
 problem between the two men Korolev blamed Glushko for denouncing him in the
 great purge under Stalin in 1938 leading to Korolev's near death
 serving 6 years in a Soviet labour camp.  Glushko on the other hand considered Korolev's to be irresponsibly cavalier and autocratic towards things which were
 outside of his own of competence. This clash between them led to Glushko 
 refusing to work for Korolev and caused delays the overall program Korolev was forced to find a new engine
 designer and gave the job to Nikolai Kuznetsov who was a leading jet engine
 designer but had not designed a rocket engine before. The Kuznetsov 
 design bureau looked at the problem and realized that creating a rocket engine
 was not that different to the jet engines they were used to but they ran
 into the same problem as Glushko, in that the Soviets simply didn't have the
 industrial infrastructure that the Americans did to produce a new large
 engine. The solution they came up with was innovative  but would have both
 negative and positive outcomes. Where the Americans used 5 large engines for
 the initial booster stage of Saturn, Korolev was forced to use 30 small but
 highly efficient engines arranged in a ring of 24 around the base and 6 at
 the center in order to achieve the thrust required. The design of these engines was
 very advanced and used a method called for closed-cycle system this was capable
 of boosting the efficiency power to levels to that which were believed
 impossible before. The Americans had known about the closed cycle system but
 thought it was too difficult and dangerous as the high-pressure
 high-temperature oxygen method could cause the engine to burn up, so they used
 for more reliable but less efficient open cycle system but with much larger
 engines. It had only been possible for the Soviets to create a closed-cycle
 engine because they had secretly developed advanced stainless steel
 alloys something which the Americans didn't know about at of the time.
 Using so many smaller engines allowed the N1 rocket to create more power than the
 Saturn but the likelihood of one or more of them failing and making a rocket
 unstable was much greater. One of the main problems was the complex fuel
 plumbing that was required to supply all the engines which in time proved to be a
 very fragile system. But just as the Soviets were working on the new engines,
 in 1966 Korolev died after undergoing a routine operation,  this was a setback
 because Korolev had a unique set of abilities and connections and was the
 major driving force behind making sure that the moon missions would be
 delivered. The work of continuing fell to Vasily Mishkin, Korolev’s deputy but
 Mishkin didn't have the political astuteness or power of his old boss. The
 Soviets also didn't have the facilities to test all 30 of the engines of the
 main stage at once before they were mounted to the rocket. The Baikonur
 launch complex could also not be reached by heavy barges so the whole rocket had
 to be broken down into sections transported by rail and then rebuilt
 again at the launchpad. This meant that the development of the
 N1 rocket as a whole was still ongoing when it came to the launches, so it was
 almost expected that there would be failures. The Soviets planned 14 launches
 the first 12 will be unmanned and the last two would be the manned
 lunar missions. On the 21st February 1969 the first N1 rocket was prepared for
 launch. This would be the first time that the whole system had been tested in fact
 it was revealed later but only two out of every batch of six engines had even
 been run before the launch. This was in contrast to the Americans which were
 fully able to test their F1 engines before the Saturn was assembled. Once
 that have been done it was removed from the assembly building to the launchpad
 nearby, fully assembled tested and ready to go. Within seconds of the launch of
 the engine control system which was called Kord shut down 2 the 30 stage
 one engines, then self oscillating vibration started in the fuel system due
 to unstable combustion in some of the engines, this ruptured fuel lines which
 caught fire and burned through electrical control wiring, this then
 caused the KROD system to incorrectly shut down all of the engines 68 seconds
 into the flight and the rocket crashed 32 miles from the launch pad. After the
 investigation and subsequent modification, the second flight was due
 for the 3rd July 1969, the launch took place at 11:18 p.m. as the rocket
 cleared the tower the liquid oxygen turbo pump on engine number eight
 exploded causing a fire which triggered KORD to shut down all the
 engines except one, the N1 fell back onto the launch pad with nearly 2,300 tonnes
 of rocket fuel on board, the resulting explosion was one of the largest ever to
 happen and was the equivalent of 3.8 kilotons of TNT or a small nuclear bomb.
 It destroyed the launch complex, blasted debris over 6 miles away and was
 visible over 22 miles away. Some 30 minutes after the blast when launch
 crews were allowed onto the site they found droplets of unburned rocket fuel still raining down from the
 sky and afterwards it was discovered that 85% of the rocket
 fuel did not detonate which actually reduced the size of a blast. 17 days
 later Neil Armstrong became the first man on
 the Moon with the Apollo 11 mission and although the race for the moon had been lost, 
 the Soviets carried on. The blast caused a two-year delay whilst the launch complex
 was rebuilt and further modifications were made to the rocket. In November of
 1971 the third attempt also failed due to unexpected Eddie and counter currents
 in the base of the main stage causing the rocket to roll uncontrollably and
 ultimately break up due to the stress on its structure. One year later in November 1972 the
 fourth and final launch also failed 107 seconds into the flight after the
 program shutdown of the six centre engines caused a hydraulic shock wave to
 rupture the fuel pipes and start a fire, the main stage then exploded shortly
 afterwards. Although there had been four previous
 launch failures the Soviets had actually made huge progress and the design by
 trial and error was believed to have ironed out all the problems but by the
 time of the fifth launched in August 1974 the whole moon mission was
 cancelled by Brezhnev By this time the Americans had been to
 the moon six times and public interest in space was waning. One theory is that
 if the fifth launch had been successful it would have forced the Soviets to
 carry on the lunar mission where the main goal of beating the USA had already
 been lost. The cancellation of the project was therefore a way of sweeping
 a very expensive undertaking under the carpet. Vasily Mishkin was ultimately
 fired and replaced by Glushko but by 1976 the N1 rocket program was scrapped. The rockets were broken up to hide the
 failure and to make the U.S. think that the space race was still ongoing. It wasn't until Gorbachev's period of ""Glasnost"" 
 when this cover story was blown and the true story of the failed Soviet moon
 mission became widely known about and why the Russians didn't put a man on the
 moon. But there is a strange twist to the end of this story, the NK 43 rockets that
 had been developed for the N1 were by the end much more reliable and the most
 efficient and powerful rocket engines for their size ever made. 20 years after
 they were meant to have been destroyed on order of a Kremlin, 60 of them were
 rediscovered and sold to be Americans for $1.1 million dollars each. A subsequent new larger model the RD-180
 based on the technology of the NK 43 is now built by the Russians and used by the
 Americans for their Atlas 5 heavy launch vehicle. Thank you for watching I hope you

moonlanding,"It's the ultimate buddy movie, with two astronauts hitting the road and landing on the moon. Earth. November 14, 1969. Three astronauts, with spacesuits, food, water, and a battery of scientific and communications equipment, prepared to fly to the moon. Thousands gathered at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, including President and Mrs. Richard Nixon, to witness the historic launch. It was raining that day, but that was no cause for delay. The ship that would carry them into space was designed to launch in any weather.  

But how would it respond to a powerful electrical storm now gathering above the launch pad? That was just the beginning of the incredible journey of Apollo 12. 

With three astronauts fastened into their seats, the countdown proceeded. Astronaut and Mission Commander Pete Conrad would say later: ""The flight was extremely normal, for the first 36 seconds."" The five engines of the Saturn 5's huge first stage were designed to burn through 5 million pounds of liquid oxygen in just two and a half minutes, and to send the spacecraft up 67 kilometers above the Atlantic Ocean. 

When it reached an altitude of 2000 meters, something unexpected happened. Racing through the stormy environment, the rocket generated a lightning bolt that traveled down its highly conductive exhaust trail. 

Another bolt hit 16 seconds later. All of the spacecraft's circuit breakers shut off. The tracking system was lost. A young flight controller in Houston, Texas instructed astronaut Alan Bean on how to turn on an auxiliary power system. The mission was back on track. Once in Earth orbit, all systems appeared to check out, and flight control officials gave the crew the green light to leave Earth.

The astronauts were not told of concern that the lighting strikes had damaged the pyrotechnic system used to deploy the parachutes that would ease them back through the Earth's atmosphere. If that system failed, the astronauts would not return alive.

This mission would have its share of perils, not unlike those faced by a long line of past explorers, whose courage and restless spirit propelled them into the unknown. This one, however, was backed by years of technology development, test flights, astronaut training, and the largest support team back home that any mission ever had.

But hundreds of thousands of kilometers out in space the three astronauts were pretty much on their own. What made Apollo 12 unique was the friendship and chemistry of its crew. Conrad, Bean, and Richard Gordon were all Navy men. Working and training together on the Gemini program, they had gained each other's respect and trust. 

Now, hurtling across more than 400,000 kilometers to the moon, they prepared to fullfill the mission's goals. One was to set up a scientific station designed to record seismic, atmospheric, and solar data. 

Another was to visit an unmanned lunar probe called Surveyor III that had landed there two and a half years before. The idea was to bring back a part to study the effect of the lunar environment. 

A third goal was to improve on the landing of Apollo 11 just 5 months before. Dropping down over a region called the Sea of Tranquility, pilot Neil Armstrong found himself heading straight for a crater full of boulders. He had to fly over the planned landing site and find a new one. Now kilometers beyond the target, the lander, called Eagle, was literally running out of gas.

 known as the Ocean of Storms, some 2000 kilometers from where the Eagle had landed. Here, the landscape is dark from lava that
 cooled to form its flat expanse billions of years ago. Within it, an impacting asteroid had hollowed
 out Copernicus crater, perhaps showering the region with rocks blasted out from deep underground. To sample this geological treasure trove,
 the astronauts sought to land at a series of smaller craters about 45 kilometers away. After a journey lasting 83 and a half hours,
 the crew fired the spacecraft’s engine to go into an elliptical lunar orbit. Five hours later a second burn put the spacecraft
 into a circular orbit 111 kilometers above the lunar surface. The next day, Pete Conrad and Allan Bean entered
 the lunar module, Intrepid. Separating from the command module, they dropped
 down toward their target. Pete Conrad would rely on improvements in
 the ship’s landing radar to find his way to touchdown. Pete Conrad and Alan Bean landed without a
 hitch. Now, they prepared to climb down the ladder
 to experience a whole new world. The plan was for Earth to experience it too,
 courtesy of a color video camera that was designed to send back a live signal. Conrad was careful to keep it pointed away
 from the Sun to protect its sensitive imaging tubes. Unfortunately, it caught the glare from Intrepid’s
 shiny surface, and blew. Back on Earth, the television networks cancelled
 their coverage. Millions of viewers then went about their
 day. Which left Conrad and Bean to go about theirs’. The astronauts spent the first of two four-hour
 moonwalks setting up science and communications equipment, taking photographs, and seeing
 what was there. There were discoveries and surprises aplenty. One was a series of mounds out in the open,
 perhaps made up of material ejected from the craters upon impact. Two and a half hours into the moonwalk, the
 astronauts flipped their wrist-mounted checklists to their next task. They opened an unlikely page, placed there
 by the Apollo 12 back-up crew. This little prank hardly distracted from their
 central goal: to walk among the craters making observations and picking up rocks. That was part of a major, unheralded, scientific
 quest of the Apollo program: to find clues to where the moon came from. At the time, there were three leading theories. The so-called fission theory, championed by
 George Howard Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, held that the moon was once part of the Earth,
 cast off by the rapid spin of its young parent. That might explain the Pacific Ocean, a giant
 hole in the Earth’s surface. Then there was the capture theory, which held
 that the moon was a wayward object that floated through our solar system and was pulled into
 orbit by Earth’s gravity. A third idea came from the American astronomer
 Thomas Jefferson Jackson See, known at the time for his attacks on Einstein’s theories. He suggested that the Moon formed near Earth
 and gradually fell under its gravitational spell. In that case, moon rocks should resemble those
 of Earth. Finding out which theory is correct would
 also yield clues to the formation of the solar system at large, and perhaps even to the birth
 of our own planet. Day Two on the Moon. Neither Conrad nor Bean had been able to get
 much sleep. Excitement got the best of them. The pair now left Intrepid for a second, and
 final, moonwalk. The suits they wore had been built for spending
 time on the Moon’s surface, with five layers stitched together to maintain constant temperature
 and air pressure. Because direct exposure to the sun could heat
 the suits to 120 degrees Fahrenheit, the innermost layers circulated water around the astronaut’s
 body to keep him cool. On the outside was a shell to protect against
 micro-meteors that routinely batter the moon’s surface. The astronauts found that lunar dust was so
 abrasive that this outer layer quickly sustained damage, and so fine that it crept into the
 rotating wrist joints. This time, the plan was to move out along
 the edge of Surveyor Crater and pay the probe a visit. Along the way, there were pictures to take,
 samples to collect, coring tools to drive into the ground. It was a world filled with optical illusions
 and strange juxtapositions. The lunar landscape appears monochromatic,
 a bright gray. With no atmosphere, the light is harsh, with
 shadows cast in deep black. But close up, the moon offers a variety of
 rich and colorful details owing to its tumultuous past. The Ocean of Storms is an ancient basin that
 was hollowed out by a huge impact and filled with lava. Finally, the team arrived at Surveyor. They cut off select components to take back
 to Earth. Scientists would make a surprising discovery
 lodged in the camera was a colony of bacteria. Did it sneak into the component upon its return
 to Earth? Or, had it somehow survived for two and a
 half years on the moon? To this day, no one knows the answer to this
 intriguing question. One final stop remained: Block crater, where
 a basketball-sized impactor had exposed the lunar bedrock, leaving a wealth of new samples. One rock they picked up is known as KREEP,
 for potassium, rare earth elements, and phosphorus. It’s thought to be a piece of bedrock that
 formed over 4 billion years ago… on a lunar surface that was entirely molten. Just a few years later, this evidence would
 coalesce into a radical new idea of the moon’s origins. At the dawn of the solar system, Earth shared
 an orbit with a Mars-sized body now called Theia. Its orbit became unstable and it headed in
 Earth’s direction. Theia struck Earth at an oblique angle, causing
 the Earth to spin faster and debris from both bodies to fly into orbit. When the dust settled, the debris began to
 coalesce in Earth orbit, forming the Moon. The moon, then, comes primarily from the outer
 layers of the Earth and Theia. That’s why overall the moon is less dense
 than Earth. From this violent beginning, the moon gradually
 cooled, and the magma that lined its surface hardened into a crust. It was now time for Conrad and Bean to prepare
 for the return flight home. Along with their gear, they packed up 75 pounds
 of scientifically priceless dirt and rocks. In the years to come, these samples, and those
 from the remaining Apollo missions, would continue to yield clues to the history of
 the moon, and its companion, Earth. Even as Conrad and Bean lifted off from the
 moon, there was still more science to do. The lander rose up to join the command module,
 docking flawlessly. Conrad and Bean transferred their samples
 and equipment. Then they released Intrepid, sending it hurtling
 back down to the Lunar surface. The idea was to use the impact of a crash
 landing to calibrate equipment that would monitor moon quakes and asteroid impacts. When it hit, the impact resonnated like a
 bell for over half an hour, as seismic waves rippled through the moon’s interior. There was one more thing left to do: get home
 safely. Just before arrival, they gazed at a brilliant
 scene of Earth moving across the sun. Apollo 12 hit Earth’s atmosphere at 40,000
 kilometers per hour. The parachute pack opened just fine. Not even a bolt of lightning could spoil this
 trip. The crew of Apollo 12 had shown how it’s
 done, even adding flair to efficiency and precision. Well, almost. At splashdown, Alan Bean got beaned by a camera
 that had not been secured. His five stitches would be forgotten. What no one could forget was a camera magazine
 filled with exposed film that had gotten jammed and then accidentally left on the lunar surface. Ironically, given the magnitude of their accomplishment,
 the astronauts reported catching hell for that oversight. Conrad, Bean and the other astronauts of Apollo
 will go down in history as the first to step off our planet. Four moon landings later, the program faded
 away in the wake of declining expectations, social discord, and the politics of those
 turbulent times. The incredible journey of Apollo 12 lives
 on as a symbol for those who may one day revive the instinct to travel beyond our planet,
 in search of clues to the origins of our world, and our place in the cosmos. 3"

There’s a new trend going around in the commercial space industry when it comes to launch abort systems. All three commercial companies who are putting abort systems on their crewed vehicles have ditched the classic launch abort tower we’ve seen dominate abort systems in the past.

Previous vehicles like the Mercury capsule, the Apollo capsule and even the Soyuz all used an escape tower that sat on top of the crew module, capable of pulling the vehicle away from a failing rocket in a hurry.

And to make this topic even more interesting, we’re seeing another trend in abort systems... SpaceX’s Crew Dragon and Boeing’s Starliner capsules both are using liquid fueled abort motors instead of solid rocket motors.

So today we’re going to talk about the design considerations that have made SpaceX, Boeing and Blue Origin ditch abort towers on their crewed vehicles and we’re also going to evaluate why the heck Boeing and SpaceX are going with liquid motors instead of solid motors. 

And with both Boeing and SpaceX having experienced serious setbacks and complications with their liquid fueled abort systems, including the loss of a test vehicle, it raises the question… is it even a good idea?....

 the Everyday Astronaut. There's a new trend going around in the commercial space industry when it comes to launch abort systems. All 3 commercial companies who are putting abort systems on their crewed vehicles have ditched that
 classic launch abort tower we've seen dominate abort
 systems in the past. Previous vehicles like The
 Mercury capsule, The Apollo capsule and even the
 Soyuz capsule all used an escape tower that sat
 on top of the crew module. Capable of pulling the vehicle away from a failing rocket in a hurry. And to make this topic
 even more interesting we're seeing another
 trend in abort systems. SpaceX's crew Dragon capsule and Boeing Starliner capusles,
 both are using liquid filled abort motors instead
 of solid rocket motors. So today we're gonna at talk about the design considerations that have made SpaceX, Boeing and Blue Origin ditch abort towers on their crewd vehicles and we're also going to re-evaluate why the heck are Boeing and SpaceX going with liquid rocket motors instead of solid rocket motors. And with both SpaceX and Boeing having experienced serious
 setbacks and complications with their liquid fueled abort systems including the loss of a test vehicle. It raises the question,
 is it even a good idea? Now there's a lot of fun
 engineering decisions behind each and every
 system, so lets get started. (upbeat music) I've talked about abort systems
 quite a bit in the past. I have a video explaining why SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule has fins on the trunk. Which helped keep it pointy and up and flamey and down in the even of an abort. And I have another video talking about why the gemini capsule
 went with an ejection seat instead of a launch abort tower. So for a short run through on mechanical abort systems,
 here's a brief overview. If you're sitting on top of a skyscraper full of explosive materials it's generally considered a good idea to have a way to evacuate quickly if things go wrong. The way abort systems originally worked was by having a trail
 of wires running down the entire length of
 the tanks of the rocket. If any two of them are
 severed it triggered an abort system to fire
 up the motors and detach the crew module within
 a fraction of a second. The abort motors have
 to be powerful enough to pull the vehicle away from a failing rocket as quickly as possible. These systems can pull up to 15g's of accelaration for a few seconds. Now I'm not saying that sounds like fun but that actually sounds awful. It sounds like been hit by a semi-truck for a few seconds
 continuely, yeah no thanks. And since the very beginning
 of human space flight well atleast in the
 United States, engineer's opted for a launch escape tower
 stuck on top of the capsule. You'll notice some fancy scafollding with a few really powerful
 rocket motors attached to it. On top of the Mercury
 Capsule, the Apollo capsule. The Soyuz capsule,
 China's Shenzhou capsule as well as the upcoming Orion capsule and India's Gaganyaan capsule. All of these vehicles also
 used solid rocket motors in the abort system
 because solid rocket motors are very powerful for their size. They can be lit in an instant. They're simple and are relatively safe to have sitting around idle. This configuration with a tower is called a tractor of a puller system. Since the motors are
 in front of the vehicle and they pull the vehicle free as opposed to most rocket motors which are at the bottom end of the
 vehicle and they push it. The three newest capsules that will be carrying humans to space have opted to ditch the tractor abort systems and go with a different
 approach called a pusher system. And even more interestingly
 SpaceX, Boeing and Blue Origin all have wildly different
 reasons for doing so. So let's start off with Blue Origin and their New Shepard capsule. New Shepard is one of two players in the sub-orbital tourism game. Competing with Virgin Galactic and their Spaceship To Space Plane but Blue Origin's New Shepard is the only one of these two that
 offers an abort system. The abort system that Blue Origin decided to go with is solid rocket motor placed smack in the
 middle of their capsule underneath what looks
 like a beautiful table but is actually a large
 chunk of blast resistant and high pressured tubing
 holding the solid rocket motor. As mentioned before this
 makes it a pusher system since the exhaust comes out of the bottom of the vehicle when used during an abort. Now an interesting note with this system is how wobbly it looks when in use. This is likely because
 the center of thrust is very close to the center of mass making it inherently less stable. I talked about this briefly in the video about why the Crew Dragon
 capsule has fins on the trunk. Saying it looks like New Shepard could use some aero-services to
 help keep it more stable but then again as long as it get's the heck out of there, it's probably fine. Blue Origins use of a solid rocket booster makes sense for this abort system. Since it's only to be used in emergency. It just kinda hangs out there hoping to never need to be used. Something a solid rocket
 motor does perfectly. It's high thrust to weight
 ratio and safe storage makes it a no-brainer for this. So now we can ask ourselves, why didn't they go with a more
 traditional escape tower? First off, The New Shepard is trying to operate as inexpensively and frequently as possible by being fully re-usable. It's booster very impressively lands itself propusively and
 the capusle relies on safe and reliable parachutes
 to make a soft touchdown. The name of the game is
 little to no refurbishment. A lauch abort tower is
 traditionally jettisoned once it's useful window of operation has passed to free up dead
 weight from the vehicle but with a sub-orbital system that only goes straight up
 and straight back down. You'd think they'd probably
 just keep the tower on. And this is espcially
 true since there's no docking port that would need
 to be uncovered because their New Shepard vehicle
 doesn't dock with anything but say you did leave it on, it's pretty safe to say you wouldn't
 wanna deploy your parachutes in the vicinity of that launch
 escape tower because there'd be a pretty big risk of them
 getting tangled up in it. So in the case of a launch abort tower mission success relies on that tower being ditched or else the
 parachutes won't work correctly. So that raises the
 question, is it better to design a system that requires a separation event every single flight
 in order to be successful? Or do you wanna design a system that only needs to be used in an emergency? And besides that Blue Origin wouldn't want to ditch the abort tower and flight since it could land pretty close to their facilties and it would be likely destroyed with each and every flight,
 which would add to the cost but there's perhaps even a bigger reason why Blue Origin went with pusher system. And by bigger, I mean bigger. Take a look at these puller systems. Do you notice anything missing? Puller systems almost always have a protective faring or a shell that covers the windows and the rest of the vehicle to protect the vehicle if
 the abort system is used. It'd generally be a good idea
 to make sure your windows are covered up so you don't
 completely oblitirate them. The Mercury capsules had
 a window and an escape tower but on the Mercury
 capsule the motors were much higher up on the
 tower than other systems. And we did things a little differently in the early days of human space flight that might just be frowned upon today. Since puller abort
 motors and windows don't typically go hand in hand, covering up world's largest windows that go to space would be a pretty big shame. Since New Shepards entire
 purpose is to provide the ultimate tourist
 experience with stunning views. They sure wanna make sure seeing out those big, giant, beautiful
 windows is a top priority. So for Blue Origin the
 use of a pusher type solid rocket motor abort system
 makes the most sense. Next up, let's talk
 about Boeing's Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon
 Capsules which both were designed for NASA to send crews up to the International Space Station. Now these are purpose
 built taxis to the ISS first and foremost although both vehicles may seek commercial use
 someday for private customers. I have a video that dives really deep into both of these
 vehicles and the rockets they ride on and then I compared them to the space shuttle and Soyuz, the other vehicles that visit the ISS. So if you need a rundown
 on what the history is. The specs and all of the considerations of these vehicles, definetely
 check this video out. Both SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule and Boeing's Starliner opted
 to use a pusher system too. They've chosen to ditch the tower but both of these cheicles opted to use liquid fueled abort motors instead of the more traditional
 solid rocket motors. Now you might be thinking,
 how can a liquid fueled rocket engine be quick and safe enough to be relied upon for an emergency abort. After all, rocket engines can
 take several seconds to get the pumps spinning and for
 ignition to occur so that doesn't really sounds like a good option. Well, these liquid fueled rocket engines are using a similar system to what's used in reaction controlled systems which offer very quick and reliable ignition. They do this by using utilizing a pumpless rocket engine known as
 a pressure fed engine. Pressure fed engines just
 have their propellants stored in a very high pressure tank. They open a valve and they let it rip. And to make it even more reliable the pressure fed engines
 used on these abort motors run on hypergolic propellants. Hypergolic propellants burn
 on contact with each other so there's no need for
 a secondary ignition source like a spark or a flame. This makes the pressure
 fed hypergolic engine very simple, quick acting and reliable. A great choice for reaction
 control and abort motors. It should also be noted
 that although hypergolic fuels are very stable
 and reliable, they're incredibly toxic, Cancerogenic
 and just really nasty stuff. So why did both companies choose
 liquid fueled abort motors? There's a few reasons
 but first and foremost it's likely due to increased
 safety requirements from NASA. They wants what's known as
 fuel envelope abort system or the ability to abort safely
 from any point in the flight. Now solid rocket motors can
 provide this option too. For instance, the Orion
 capsule solid rocket tractor system offers an abort mode for the first two minutes of flight after which the tower
 is jettisoned and the second stage of the SLS
 system or the service modules AJ 10 engine can
 provide abort options. But with liquid fueled
 abort motors they can fire them for less time or lower thrust than a solid rocket motor which gives them the ability to place the vehicle precisely into a desired trajectory to either re-enter safely or abort to orbit. Which can make it easier to design a full envelope abort window. But quite frankly each
 company could have gone with a typical tractor solid
 rocket motor abort system. As a matter of fact,
 SpaceX's original concepts for the Crew Dragon
 capsule or Dragon Rider as they called it back
 then was going to utilize a traditional tower and
 then jettison it on ascent as we can see in this animation from 2010. So the first reason each
 company opted for a pusher system is the same reason
 we talked about before. By removing a separation
 event, you're eliminating a potential mission failure scenario. By intergrating the abort
 system into the vehicle it simplifies sequence of events
 needed for mission success. But intergrating the abort system doesn't necasarily mean they have to
 use liquid fuels, does it? I mean, New Shepard get's away with it. Well there's two reasons
 why utilizing liquid fuel abort motors in these cases are actually more useful or even necessary
 in an integrated abort system. The first reason is control. Liquid fuel rocket motors can steer and point the vehicle by doing something called thrust differential
 which is where they can increase or decrease
 thrust on any of the motors and that can help point
 it in the correct way. This definetely helps keep the pointy end up and the flamey end down. Now there are ways to
 control a solid rocket motor but thrust differential isn't one of them. So in order to steer a solid abort tower one cool way is by having a seperate solid motor fire and having multiple valves open and close on each side of the tower. Take a look at this Orion
 attitude control motor test. Inside there is a solid rocket motor that lights and cannot be
 turned off once activated but in order to provide steering, they can vary how much thrust comes out
 of any of it's eight valves. To provide neutral input they just open up all eight valves equally which then will produce no change in direction. They then stick this unit really high up on the abort tower to provide maximum leverage over the vehicle which helps provide ample control during the abort. I think this is really cool. In a pusher system there's
 no tower to provide leverage so you can't put control
 services up there. So using a solid rocket motor that can't provide thrust differential
 can be a bit of a no-no. But there's actually another reason why you can't use solid rocket
 motors on these two vehicles. And that's because
 these vehicles visit the International Space
 Station and because they visit the International Space Station the abort motors also visit the station. This means 32 times a day
 the vehicle has extreme changes in temperature or thermal cycles. Now hypergolics are happy as a clam and stable hanging out
 in these conditions. As a matter of fact, there's hypergolics on the station as we speak. The thermal cycling of
 a rocket motor that much could potentially lead
 to some unintended booms. And that's definetely not a good thing when you're attached to
 the single most expensive piece of machinery with
 precious human lives on board. So why are they even bothering intergrating the launch
 abort system at all? This all sounds like an
 awful lot of trouble. Besides the simplicity of an integrated system not needing to
 separate, the two companies actually have very different
 reasons for their integration. Boeing modified some Aerojet
 Rocketdyne RS-88 Bantam motors to run on the
 same fuel as the reaction contol system that is part
 of the service modules Starliner instead of the alcohol and liquid oxygen they normally use. The service module also
 houses the solar panels and radiators of the vehicle. By using the same fuel for
 the abort and the reaction control systems it means
 an anominal mission the abort system obviously
 isn't utilized which means the extra propellent can
 be used for other things. Besides having more fuel
 for orbital maneuvering you also end up with spare propellent to potentially reboost the
 International Space Station. Now this is something only
 Russia's Progress supply vehicle and the Signis cargo
 vehicle can currently do. But the retired space shuttle and the ATV vehicle could also do it previously. Having the ability to reboost the station is definetely a nice selling point. Although we don't have any
 confirmation on whether or not Starliner will
 ever perform this maneuver but atleast having it is
 isn't a bad option at all. But for SpaceX, perhaps
 their biggest reason why they didn't wanna ditch their motors is 'cause they designed the Dragon capsule to be reused as much as possible. This means by integrating
 the abort motors with the capsule itself, they would
 recover them with each flight. But ironically the Dragon capsule is less reusable than the Starliner
 since the Crew Dragon capsule splashes down as opposed to the Starliner which will land on land. This means that the Crew Dragon capusle will never be never be reused for crew and will only be used as a cargo vessel. And what's even more
 ironic is the Starliner which lands on land and can
 be reused up to 10 times ditches it's abort motors
 with each and every flight. As the service module which houses the abort motors is
 jettisoned before re-entry. So the vehicle which lands on land ditches it's abort motors and the one that lands in the ocean keeps it's abort motors. That's interesting but the main reason why SpaceX's Crew Dragon has the super Draco liquid fuel abort motors
 in the first place isn't just for abort options. They originally intended to land the Dragon capsule propulsively. Yes that's right, they originally intended to land the Dragon
 Capsule much like SpaceX lands it's Falcon9 and
 Falcon Heavy Rockets. Riding pillars of flames, so cool. Now the original reason
 for landing propulsively was for rapid and easy
 reuse of the vehicle. Not only that but they also wanted the Dragon capsule to land on Mars. SpaceX's original goal with the Dragon was to land it on Mars for
 a mission dubbed Red Dragon but the whole propulsive
 landing idea got scrapped. SpaceX gave up on pursuing
 propulsive landing with the Dragon capsule
 mostly because NASA really wasn't interested in the concept. As it would require far too
 much additional work to certify. So now that we've talked about why each company ditched the tower and why both Boeing and SpaceX has opted to use liquid fuelled propellent's
 for it's launch abort systems. It raises the question,
 is it even a good idea? Both Boeing and SpaceX have had problems when testing their liquid abort systems. Boeing experienced an
 anomily with a Starliner test vehicle in 2018 when preparing to do a pad abort test, where the hypergolic fuels leaked out of the vehicle. SpaceX had something a little more energetic happen in 2019 when preparing to do a static fire test
 prior to an in-flight abort test with their recovered
 DM-1 Crew Dragon capsule. In my opinion these issues
 will get worked out. These fuels using these
 systems are the same or very similar to almost
 all orbital spacecraft. After all, satellites
 often use hypergolic fuels and a liquid motor to do
 their orbital maneuvering. The space shuttle had hypergolic fuels for it's orbital maneuvering system and hypergolics are already used on Dragon-1 for well over a dozen missions. And there rarely has been any
 issues with these systems. In general these systems can
 be safe, simple and reliable. So why are we seeing such major problems arise when testing them? Well the public relation
 answer is, that's why we test. But I kind of have a feeling it has to do with how you test this stuff. You often times go beyond
 what you'd normally be doing. And doing things in
 these testing campaigns that wouldn't normally be
 done on the launch pad. As far as is it a good
 idea, I mean I think so. The fuels are already on the
 vehicle in the first place so it makes sense to use them
 for a launch abort system. Liquid fueled abort systems are useful. Potentially reusable and actually make for a simpler spacecraft
 and mission profile. Not to mention, when they're not used they can be utilized for other purposes such as reboosting the ISS
 or even propulsively landing. Although we probably won't ever see either of those things happen. I'm sure each company is learning from the failures of these systems and I have little doubt this will all be sorted out before we ever put humans on board. And hopefully that's
 sooner rather than later. So it is interesting that we went from one common form of launch abort to suddenly three 21st century companies
 using widly different systems. But in the long run each
 company has a unique reason behind their engineering decisions. Which I find fun. So does this help answer your questions of why companies have
 scrapped abort towers? Or why they're now using
 liquid fueled rocket motors? Let me know if you have
 any other questions about this topic in the comments below. In keeping with this trend of talking about escape systems, I
 plan on making a video about why SpaceX doesn't plan to use an abort system on their upcoming Starship and help answer the question of whether or not that's a good idea. I owe a huge thanks to

has progressed from the sandy hills of Kitty Hawk along the Atlantic coast into the vast new ocean of space journeys been difficult and dangerous but it's also been rewarding it's given us a better understanding of our home planet our solar system and the universe although humans have dreamed of sailing outward from the planet Earth for centuries the realization of that vision began just five decades I had been working for NACA since 1945 as the young aeronautical engineer right out of college in airplane flight test and we were not interested in space at that time you were interested in high-speed aerodynamics the x-15 was being built there's the drop before it returns to earth again the x-15 may fly some 60 miles straight up at nearly 4000 miles per hour we were in Cold War that was darn close to hot war the Russians and and there was great concern both the sides had nuclear weapons you know we grew up fearing the Russians I can remember when I was in school going through drills where we got under our seats so this idea of them beating us in space was a pretty awesome idea they were claiming superiority and we didn't believe that but they had been launching some rockets and ours too often had been blowing up on the launch pad and that was sort of the background to what happened then in 57 when they sent up Sputnik there's a Russian of satellite which is going over every 90 minutes beep and it didn't take much imagination to know that that could have been involved I remember being very surprised that they had done this and that we had not been able to do it ahead of them that was my main concern I think that was the main concern of most Americans at that time right then I think we all inwardly resolved that that one goal laughs would go do something about it it was just a faint beep a radio beacon coming from a shiny little orb circling the earth in 1957 Sputnik signaled the beginning of the Space Age and the United States was behind our first successful answer to Sputnik came with the launch of the Explorer 1 satellite and within the year the formation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration when I came up here in May of 1958 there was no Marshall Space Flight Center von Braun and his team were all part of what was called an army ballistic missile agency and it was that agency actually that built and launched the first Explorer satellites maybe panic we took enormous pride in that because although it followed Sputnik Explorer one had science instruments on it and so it really marks the first use of space for scientific exploration gave us the idea that we were surrounded by radiation belts that we knew nothing about no Barry so we were off and running as a result of Sputnik and it resulted of course in the establishment of NASA by President Eisenhower in the summer of 1958 we have one of the most challenging assignments that has ever been given to modern man we will be developing and launching into space vehicles needed to obtain scientific data and to explore the solar system we will be preparing for the day when manned flight goes into space Sieg Lennon was really outstanding in that period of drawing together the thoughts of the people in the organization and seeking people from outside of course I was a young punk at that time in those early years and I was a little hesitant about expressing myself but the way he worked it it got to a point where was very common for everyone to really Express how they felt until I the first active 58mm dr. maura and about 2,000 of us members of the team I guess all transitioned from the Army to Marshall we were blessed here because the leaders of all of our labs were original members of the Von Braun team and these guys were brilliant scientists they had been there they've done it they made mistakes they had blown up more rockets than anybody could ever conceive on and they were our Mentors I don't think but about once every hundred here's a person when blood Brown comes around he was top-notch engineer he was a top-notch scientists and but he had something that most other people don't have and he was a visionary you know it was crazy bad thing about going to the moon you know it was crazy in van brand-new we could do it and afterwards been around him for a while we have scientific knowledge with our smaller people since the Russians have with them up swapped out once we were trying to build satellites to try to get things going trying to catch up with the Russians passing by and a lot of exciting things were going all of those in those early days a near perfect take off guys like Max was Jay and nopales aircraft Research Division who had been designing these rockets over over at Wallops they had all been dreaming about man and space I remember walking into a match for Jays office and there on the wall he had a picture of a guy in the fetal position in a little caps ooh yeah I said what are you gonna do with that max he said well we're gonna launch a guy into space yeah I said well you know that like the G's are very very high he says oh yeah he'll black out but he'll come to we knew the Soviets we're gonna try and apply a man after they they launched their first satellite and the Soviets knew we were gonna try to do the same thing the nation was getting ready to put a man in space I mean that was a commitment and that was the focus we didn't know much about the space environment you know a young person like myself with no experience who was on an equal par with everybody there's no one had unique experience and it was it was exciting times and and any information you found was valuable and people were interested in it and looked at it but then when they opened this up for manned spaceflight and announced that program and one volunteers for it I thought that was a natural with the background I had of test flying and I met the criteria that they were shooting for I was a test pilot and the job of a test pilot is to fly new airplanes here with the dawn of space flight was an opportunity to fly an airplane of a sort that made an order-of-magnitude jump in height altitude and speed and distance and they were trying to convince it how neat it would be to get in a capsule on top of a rocket I said no way send that idiot that goes out of the cannon in the circus let him land on a net and forget us there's no no don't don't worry we're gonna put some monkeys and chimpanzees in first now I know I want out of here so I really had a very negative opinion of it before the first flight we will have developed our Mercury spaceship to the point where it will be as reliable as man can devise today we are introducing to you and the world these seven men who have been selected to begin training for orbital space flight I feel that this is the future of not only this country but the world we've gone about as far as we can on this globe and we have to start looking around a bit and it's just the natural expansion of flight Project Mercury is just one part of the endeavor - its space travel I got on this project because it'd probably be the nearest to heaven not ever yet no one to make the most of it these ladies and gentlemen are the nation's mercury astronauts echo was 100 feet in diameter and it was one of the biggest challenges that we had in like in communication involving the use of the satellite balloon the real thing that came out of it was that every buyer the world saw it they knew that the United States was in the spaceman convincing others that humans could do a job in space that's what we were up to in Project Mercury a 98% of the medical community in the United States did not think the man could survive in that environment much less do a job and that was very important to the future of manned spaceflight because it allowed us to take advantage of the human beings thinking capacity his intelligence and it simplified the design of the spacecraft frankly and none of us had ever ever seen a missile launch and so five four three two one and the booster launches and it the big flame and we're standing there walking up like this and here are these seven budding astronauts watching as it goes up in his twenty seven thousand feet and blew and it just looked like an atomic bomb went off over our head up there and I remember I was looking at each other and saying we got to talk to some engineers tomorrow there was the initial launch that any of us had ever seen that the Cape nopales aircraft the division is actually the division that got us into space because I work from acts with J and Max version a of course is the one who did the mercury capsule and invented that completely I'll tell you it became immediately apparent to me the only practical approach was was was on I I had to propose simply because it provided the lightest way to do it our best launch vehicle was Atmos the mercury the only one who had a chance to be made light enough to be able to make orbit on Atlas we didn't call it mercury that day we still call it the capsule the concept we came up with was it was a primate from Mercury I'm a bum ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum ba-bum dang dang dang then you donned a room and then we started launching monkeys and then chimpanzees and then they launched Yuri Gagarin we were totally tricked by that Yuri Gagarin and the Soviets got there first and that was a terrible disappointment for the nation and for us of course Yuri Gagarin was launched into Earth orbit in 1961 the United States still wasn't there but the 60s were a decade of change and NASA would forever change the course of human exploration we were getting telegrams like mad from all over the country from The Associated nurse Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ASPCA please stop washing these chimpanzees so we launched Alan Shepard I always think that Alan Shepards flight was a fantastic moment in the history of NASA and the history of manned spaceflight but I think back on that and I watched him come out of that band on the redstone pad and look up at that rocket in that silver suit he had on and all those lights flashing and then people looking at him and watching and wondering himself what the hell he was doing there getting up on top of this rocket I think the biggest surprise I had a whole series of events of the space program because after Shepards flight weeks President Kennedy said I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth I thought that is the most audacious thing I have ever heard in my entire life are we serious about this remember now when he said that we had met to orbit the first man in this country John Glenn was 10 months away from flying most of us thought he was really stretching the point and frankly I thought he was a Bismarck we didn't really even have computers at the start of this we were all still using our slide rules because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won he was asking us to do with most people at the time thought couldn't be done but he was doing it in an environment in which the Soviet Union literally own space and he laid the gauntlet down American people picked it got lit up and got to a point where they didn't know it couldn't be done not because they are easy but because they are hard that was all heady stuff and we were all you know go go man go so to go to orbital speed do you have to go 17,000 300 miles an hour that's how fast you have to go to balance gravity so the first manned flight for orbit was John Glenn doctors were concerned for instance that when you're in zero-g for a while for several hours you're afraid your eyes might change shape that you wouldn't be able to even keep your vision on the instrument panel so we were out to prove what those things did not make the difference but and that's what that first light was all about when John flew he saw these glowing particles at sunset and they look a little like Firefly so he told the ground its fireflies and it was a major mystery but I could create these fireflies by wrapping on the side of the spacecraft it turned out they were little chips of ice and they fly past the window like a firefly might my mission ended up being controversial because I overshot of the landing by I think 200 miles so my flight did contribute a lot of new knowledge to the science of space flight and it took the form of redesign but all flights do that you know we stand on the shoulders of those who go before us whether or not they overshoot the interesting part of the mercury mission of Sigma 7 was that we were over the South Atlantic and prior to that mission the Russians had set off a nuclear bomb at high altitude so at radiation devices they would measure 10 Rankin's 5 Rankin's 1 Rankine and 1/2 rank or something like that I didn't get a reading on any of those things so it turned out we were ok so we could go on and let Cooper go over the South Atlantic over many many times it truly was the Age of Aquarius in the 60s the mood around us was always electric the press revered the astronauts and it revered those of us in the front of the program they looked up to us and we felt the responsibility so the feeling was mutual the country supported what we did we were pushing technology communications hot lights of course came into being and a lot of other neat things have happened as a result of that technology push the country was trying to build a supersonic transport at least to do some research and build some prototypes so by trying to study the flow fields about these vehicles trying to compute the sonic booms and their propagation to the ground was a very interesting man challenging problem there was a lot of interest in must largely because of the publicity which the planet received at the hands of Percival Lowell in the early 1900's he reported that he saw canals we've made out a pretty good case that the planet must have intelligent life won and so a lot of interested environment for them because of successfully flown past Mars taking some photographs as it went by the most important piece of data from Mariner 4 was the photograph number 11 which showed very clearly a crater which looked just like the craters on the moon although by today's standards the quality of these pictures are pretty poor they were definitely showing that Mars were much more like the moon than it was like the earth Gemini was the program between Mercury of the single seater in Earth orbit and Apollo the three seater all the way to the moon liftoff Germany of course carried two people but I wasn't the people that it carried it was the concepts Germany was a great program because we learned how to operate in space how to do EBA how to use computers so what we did with Germany we did rendezvous which I was very thrilled to do we did the docking we did the change of orbit we did a precise reentry all of those were very important to the company 12 Houston Capcom there wiII be a record beautiful job Apollo 1 was to be the first man test of the Apollo spacecraft so it was a real shocker to find that we lost a crew not in space but right there on the pad the fire on the pad was a traumatic event it ripped us apart to be perfectly honest with you a terrible day we were not doing a good job we were running too fast it forced us to reconsider what we were doing and do job properly but I thought having happened I don't think we would have gotten to the moon in the sixties five weeks later as the backup crew we inherited the first manned Apollo mission which turned out the Apollo 7 but as there were many things with NASA what was a disaster with Apollo 1 turned out to be a real triumph with Apollo 7 because the spacecraft itself was a was a marvelous flying machine it went 11 days so we were quite proud of the fact that we took and had a triumph out of a disaster and that was what Apollo 7 did for me it proved that we could do all the things we set out to do and do it well this is Apollo fat on launch control we had bill go at this time - - 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 we have ignition sequence start the engines around 4 3 2 1 0 we have the first Fulop Saturn launch of all the rockets went to the moon with humans on it they need him tested individual stages they just stack them all up stuck my people up and says let's try it out send to the moon what I wonder coming to you approximately halfway between the moat of the earth we have about 40 hours left to go to the top the first time we flew a crew on the big Saturn 5 we sent them to the moon for 10 orbits not just this way around the back very bold decision on Apollo 8 when we wrote into the spacecraft and soften the very first time the far side of the moon only 60 miles below we were like three school kids looking into a candy store window kind of forgot the flight plan for a second as those ancient old craters on the far side slowly slipped by frankly I wasn't too optimistic that Apollo 11 would actually land and actually return somebody's successfully I I thought we'd get a get away with our lives I wasn't too worried about that but I just thought there were so many unknowns that I would have given us about a 50/50 chance of being the first flight to land and return someone safely like the fellers gonna go for landing retro no I don't control oh oh no surgeon go Capcom we're go for landing altitude 4200 thing you're go for landing over there are certain events in life that you never forget and they the lunar landing and in particular the last seconds leading up to the landing will never be forgotten we battled to get to the surface we're halfway to our abort limit about the time we got that started out we started having a series of computer program alarms and as the crew took over at about two minutes prior to landing searching for a landing site we knew that they were going to be using a lot more fuel than we expected have a good feeling about just how far they were nasty man even though they kept going and going and going what were our chances of landing successfully getting outside that was pretty easy to do it was touching down so that later missions could touch down and then do the rest of the stuff but the landing with 15 seconds of fuel remaining that was even important thing for were driven to the right level I'm back right okay engine stop we got to get down and go with a gaudy babe here he go I landed it was like Jewess rocket tranquility we can't be on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue we're breathing again thanks a lot okay keep the chatter down in this room the unfortunate thing is no controller had an opportunity to absorb the emotion of that landing because we had to work for the next two hours non-stop okay you want stay no stay retro Hey right Oh State Patrol calm ANC thank God thanks urgent hey Capcom or state forty-one and we're getting a picture on the TV have you had a good picture up and tell that moment television have always been a goal but not a requirement once we landed safely the only thing that counted was for us to see the picture step off the LEM now what I felt at that moment was the TV better worker else and if it doesn't really really will Know Who I am because I'll be the man who didn't bring you television from the night that's one small step for man the world just marveled at this right along with us and we more or less made the whole world our partners in this thing by inviting people to be there I think that's one of the best things we ever we ever did in the space program and one of the best decisions ever made with regard the space program was to share that with the world I think it was the biggest event from an aviation point of view and probably from a scientific point of view that happened in the 20th century and maybe in history of man Peyman aids for all mankind it over but we had a good time on Apollo 12 and so we were happy to go and anxious to for the great adventure and so off we go and we go into a thunderstorm immediately after launch and get hit by lightning and it lights up a lot of caution and warning lights and we didn't know what to do thank God for Mission Control because they came up and gave us some advice and and so we powered it back up again with their help and everything worked out okay we went into orbit and then off to the moon they landed us perfectly if we had not touched the controls we would have landed right in the middle of the crater that we were shooting for so they wouldn't have missed it by 10 feet and when you figure we went 240 thousand miles that's pretty amazing shows you the kind of capability that NASA has so we got out for that time and we can place some experiments and then we collected a lot of rocks and made some observations and then our primary job had been to land near surveyor which was an unmanned spacecraft that had landed on the moon in the ocean of storms some 33 months earlier that look so we were going to land there and pick up some parts like the TV camera and the scoop and things like that bring him back to earth for evaluation Apollo 13 was a team effort from very beginning to the end when the crew threw the switches to start the crowd stir a spark jump between the fan and the heater assembly and the pressure in that tank rose very rapidly because the insulation had been damaged on the system and we now had a fire inside the tank that blew the dome of the tank off that series of events started the saga of Apollo 13 and we had a pretty large Bank though they did with the they exact words I used in Mission Control is we have never lost an American in space and we sure as hell aren't gonna lose one this crew is coming home you gotta believe it your team must believe it and we must make it happen when we suddenly realized the truth is significance of the explosion seeing the oxygen escape from the rear of my spacecraft and consequently losing all the electrical power and the propulsion system we knew we were in serious trouble you called in your backup becomes now see if we can get some more brain power and then we got one here ROG throughout the entire Apollo 13 mission the teams and Mission Control changed shifts almost regularly at eight-hour intervals and the teams kept the mission going kept working the problem as my team's tried to come up with the answers go ahead like I want you to get some guys figuring out minimum power in the LEM to sustain life fortunately the lunar module was attached to us and when that occurred with oxygen almost gone and the command module we transferred the command to the lunar module and try to use it somehow some way as a lifeboat to get home let's solve the problem but let's not make it any worse by guessing I got a lot of recognition for the work that we did but the real heroes of Apollo 13 were the people in the back rooms and over in the engineering facilities who came up with the answers we needed we never talked among ourselves about not making it back home it was like playing a game of solitaire as long as we had a card and we could put it someplace the game kept going and every crisis that we came up to we found a solution as we rounded the moon and my two companions looked at the place where we were supposed to land and there very much disappointment I said we're on our way home let's get home successfully forget about Delaney and then what all silent big business is that right for the whole panel is blown out almost to the Apollo 13 has to rate with anything we ever do because it took a great deal of ingenuity a great deal of preparation years of preparation a lot of guts on the part of the astronauts themselves to bring that off and so you have to say that Apollo 13 was a fantastic moment in the history of manned spaceflight I will tell you that we had one of the most bodacious splashdown parties that I can remember and those guys got back about that I'm going out ballet when I get back you learn another line of work up here god you're just beautiful that is that is the most beautiful sight but there you're standing arrow around that crater god I never heard John describe this beautifully not really well actually he is on this thing now I said I can't see to the bottom of it Naaman put there because I'm going to get all the different steps and all the different pieces of hardware and all op it had to work and this just inconceivable that we could do something like them the motivation was well honey and then gonna be my pocket screws up you know I'm gonna get it right and apparently everybody else felt the same way and we did it and did it and did it Apollo 17 was probably one of the more interesting missions because we had a real geologist there and they landed in a you know you know wonderfully interesting place the valley of taurus-littrow was picked as a landing site for a couple different reasons and were one it was in an area the moon we had never even come close to and it was a valley some 20 miles long and five miles across which was literally surrounded by mountain is higher than a Grand Canyon is deep yeah what point two kilometers is a long way from the left look at the Challenger down there they could get a feel for how big to fail he really is we stopped obviously at a lot of different planned places and we did everything from drilling core sample to set him experiments to drilling trenches and so forth and I thought okay this scientist has been on the moon - humph he's been he's been breathing too much oxygen there he's not gonna be on anyone's soil we not only did a lot of work on the moon but we had a good time and you know you're only gonna come that way once in your life I just looked around and no one we were leaving no we weren't coming back and yeah I said we now leave as we once came and God willing as we shall return when you look back on that now and see how long it's been since we've flown to the moon you realize not only how difficult it was but how unique it was how marvelous it was frankly it's hard for me to believe sometimes that we did it the political achievement not to mention engineered achievement of putting humans on the moon and bring them safely back to earth and improving it won the fluke by doing it six times and all that was fantastic we take for granted today the technology has come from power we live in a different world today because of Apollo although gene cernan was the 12th and last American to set foot on the moon in 1972 the exploration of space did not end there it simply turned the page in the decade of the 70s NASA's unmanned explorers set out on journeys that would cross millions of miles and show us worlds that until now had only existed as tiny points of light in the night sky yeah I got right in the beginning of Landsat NASA really really did something unique in that program but people don't really recognize we started the whole digital camera color analysis but it turned out to have this incredible characteristic that it could cover large areas at the same time bring out small deviations in the characteristics of the earth and you're gonna use color to interpret it to therefore calculate what was in the various areas I was in the desert in Kenya on the Eclipse expedition and we saw the fragments around Skylab go over us and I thought oh brother there's been an accident in the Skylab launch my hopes and desires for science that was gonna come out of science Skylab I thought well it's cooked 1973 I was commander of the second Skylab mission and Jack Lousma was the best Eevee a guy that I've ever met and I said if we send Jack out there and let him work on that thing he'll find a way lo and behold he goes out there and fools around with it awhile trying to get these connectors undone and finally gets them undone and puts it all together to work great and he went on to a Brent scientific discovery which had to do with coronal mass ejections and for the first time we were able to see these we're big chunks of the corona and blow off it's day after day of hard work and even though you have a nice view out the window that doesn't kind of pay you back for the constant effort that you have to put out to be productive in space it's a tough job and only dedicated humans can do this sort of thing it operated for about nine months which was much longer than in been anticipated and at that time we understood some things that we'd never understood before and it gave us some forward momentum in the science that continues right now till today let me call to express my very great admiration for your hard work your total dedication in preparing for this first joint flight today is not far off when eight missions made possible by this first joint effort will be more or less commonplace one of them huge surprises of the mid 20th century came with one of the Mariner spacecraft the Mariner spacecraft started towards Venus and they found that the sun's magnetic field far away from the earth was about as strong as the Earth's magnetic field and I had been taught and everybody else had them but the sun's magnetic field will be negligible and so it presented us was a tremendous confrontation of how could that be so the one planet that was most intriguing to humans human scientists was Mars mercury was closer but it was very inhospitable Venus was the nearest one to us but it was worried in hospital because the atmosphere was toxic and hot Mars showed seasonal variations that suggested something was alive and I think that was the basis for creating Viking to see if there was life on Mars when we got down and found out how dry and arid and barren the place really was came as a bit of a surprise we had hoped to find microscopic life the thing that happened that kind of left us in a quandary was the three experiments that were directly life detecting did it breathe did it eat did it do photosynthesis all said that something here and when you tried to find the dead bodies you couldn't so that kind of left us in the position why the jury is still out in the end we ended up with two successful Anna's on the service and two very successful orbiters that exceeded their lifetime by many many months so obviously we were all related then or you could say we did it we did it when we flew by Neptune people were standing in line at night at planetariums in order to be able to see the images coming in from Voyager because they weren't on the web in those days there was no web you had to go somewhere in the middle of the night to see it it became a worldwide event when Voyager was flying by these worlds and I had no idea that it would have that kind of an impact and of course that in the in the long run is the most important thing Borges dentists show how much there is the new frontiers of space the 1970s really saw the start and heavy activity in the project aircraft area which initially focused on sto L aircraft and then moved into the v/stol arena so the rotor craft worked under way very heavily and has continued to today until it is the remaining flight research activity there were about five of us that came into the space system division that had been formed to support shuttle development coming to work was fun to do that kind of thing that was a little bit unique kind of like having some very expensive toys to play with I think that was a magnificent development program you know there were an awful lot of people including some people at Langley that were very hesitant that the couple would be successful would all those thousands of thermal towels underneath protect it would it burn up it turned out to be a tremendous opportunity six five four main engine start a vehicle that could launch into space as a rocket put 25 tons of cargo into orbit and land on a runway like an airplane not just once but over and over again in the 1980s NASA would rip this concept from the pages of science fiction and place it squarely on the cutting edge of space travel going up the launchpad and they're looking up and seeing you know this huge rocket that kind of sounds like an animal you can kind of hear the gurgling and the hissing and you know it sounds like it's alive a few seconds right before liftoff every time I've done this has been a little bit of right about whether I really want to be doing this or not dopamine engine start I was really just focusing right on the tasks at hand and trying not to think about you know the fact that tons and tons and tons of rocket fuel we're about to explode around us liftoff of shuttle Discovery Roger roll discovery six seconds in this light forces and sensations are just powerful beyond imagination they shake you so much that you can hardly see the displays in front of you right after that solid rocket boosters are jettisoned at two minutes it's a very smooth ride the acceleration is very powerful and you're on the way to orbit with a very different feeling as soon as you achieved orbit the engines cut off just instantaneously you go from being pressed in the seat to hanging in your straps and sort of floating in the cockpit the fact that I was going to be the first American woman to go into space carried huge expectations along with it and of course it was very important to me that I understood my role really well and that I was really well prepared for the mission because the last thing that I wanted to do was get into space and make a mistake so I wanted to be very very sure that I was able to meet the expectations but it wasn't from me desire to be the first african-american in space my desire was to make a contribution just to make a contribution and I think I probably told people that I would probably prefer not being in that role versus being in their world because I figured being a number two that would be a lot more fun it feels like you weigh twice as much as you normally do during the entry portion once you get on final all of the emotions and in focus or just on that last little bit of landing and it's a it's a neat way to end a fight when you actually get to put your hands on the stick and fight yourself engines throttling up three hundred and a hundred and four person we come together today to mourn the loss of seven brave Americans to share the grief that we all feel and perhaps in that sharing to find the strength to bear our sorrow and the courage to look for the seeds of hope risk is something we have to just really consider as part of our life especially an exploration I know we've had some tragedies and we'll probably have tragedies in the future but you know the ones that we've lost were probably the first ones to tell you keep pressing on don't stop because of us my role as a mechanical engineer was to find out you know what fell apart or what happened and we finally found that the o-ring supposed to be designed so the pressure on one side pushes them more securely into place the the housing for that big old ring was just the opposite the pressure actually pushed it out finally of course when the thing burned through and actually burned the nozzle through it's pretty obvious to see what what the problem so with them we got the job with the redesign two spaces discovery clears the tower Roger roll discovery good morning discovery you gotta go for HST deploy ops NASA opened the decade of the 90s by placing the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit that would peer farther into space and further back in time than any other telescope and in the closing decade of the 20th century Hubble and a host of other robotic explorers would provide astonishing new views and perspectives everybody was up we were off to discover the secrets of the universe it was it was great and then things started to the east wouldn't scratch your head why is it taking so long why can't we focus the telescope what's going on what was wrong with Hubble is the kind of the same thing that's wrong with your eyes when you need glasses basically the shape of the lens was wrong so in essence the telescope was nearsighted and it needed some glasses I was taking a shower in the hotel in Germany and had these really funny shower heads where the shower head will kind of move up and down and back and forth and that's when it dawned on me we can have this instrument robotically raise up the corrective lens flip out if you will just like that shower head these other corrective optics to correct the aberration for all the instruments all of the work leading up to the first servicing mission is probably the most exciting time of my career the NASA program changed the nature of astronomy we made some extravagant promises on Hubble we under sold the program whatever we said Hubble did better I think it really changed the nature of what we know the Hubble is one of the most phenomenal things we've ever done in space data that we get from Hubble will continue to change the way we think about ourselves about the universe and our place in it you know the pictures from Hubble are iconic you see them everywhere the fingers of God this is the gas pillars that are actually many many many light-years across so the scale of these things is enormous and you actually seeing the birth of stars this is a star nursery it starts to give you a sense of how small we are and how vast the universe is and that's my favorite picture NASA especially Goddard was the place where I could carry out the dreams that I had which were to push forward an experiment that would measure the Big Bang radiation better than anyone had ever tried before and took on the job of working on Kobe for many many decades people didn't agree with the Big Bang Theory they thought and something else must be true generations of astronomers thought it must have been the steady state Theory Einstein didn't like the idea so when we got the measurements that fit exactly on the theoretical prediction for the Big Bang and this tremendous sigh of relief went through the world as well our measurement of the hot and cold spots in the Big Bang radiation which show us not only is the Big Bang Theory right but also it gives us the map of the seeds of the structure the things that will eventually grow into galaxies the Galileo probe which sent its spacecraft into the atmosphere of Jupiter was the most demanding entry probe I ever flown by anyone and it worked perfectly Europa and some of the other satellites where there seems to be accumulating evidence water are getting to be very very interesting places for exploring I mean who knows what's under the ice surface and Europa you've got water looks like there's salt water you wouldn't have water if you didn't have her source of energy the odd coloration gives some hint of the presence of organics when those conditions held on the early Earth life developed in a couple of hundred million years something interesting on Europa way to work nowadays we're discovering what is the universe really like and it's totally magnificent and one can only be inspired and awestruck by what we find so I think a proper response is complete amazement in awe at the universe that we're in and how it works is just far more complicated than humans will ever properly understand we have capture Muir was a successor to the early Salyut Space Station's that the Russians built back in the 70s Wow is extremely fortunate that I was able to be part of the shuttle-mir program obviously there were a lot of challenges when you're trying to work with a different culture I mean it's a challenge for the Russians and it's a challenge for the Americans but everybody wanted to work together to make it come to pass I definitely think it started teaching us the lessons we needed to learn and it was it was key to that very technical things that you know seem simple but become very complicated just by language and wig cultural definitions of things that you know I think our guys did a phenomenal job bringing all those pieces together booster ignition and liftoff of discovery with a crew of six astronauts heroes one American legend while I was on a discovery in 98 we had 83 different research projects on that one flight now you go up for a couple of weeks say and you find some of the things occurring on the human body that are are much the same as getting old right here on earth the body's immune system changes you get less resistant to disease and infection the body's ability to replace protein and the muscle becomes less and so the question was if could we find by comparing my reaction to the younger people's action reaction to this up there could we maybe get a clue as to what within the body turns a human system on and off with regard to immunity hopefully we can find ways maybe to make it possible for younger astronauts to go on longer missions without having some of the problems they have and at the same time cut out some of the frailties of old age for people here on earth and ever we've got unity firmly attached we we have initial contact initial contact of the Soyuz capsule with the expedition 1 crew to the International Space Station the hatch was opened at 1 0 to 1 4 0 Universal Time the first expedition on Space Station requests permission to take the radio car prime our problem we are on a true space ship now making her way above or any earthly boundary that our crews can work together as equals in our countries as partners all the other vehicles we had ever built could be totally assembled put together and tested on the ground before you launch them into space the space station is so large you know it's 360 feet wide doing an 80 feet long 120 feet thick or something like that weighs a million pounds and it takes 46 or 47 assembly flights just to take up all the pieces so every time you brought up a new piece you had a different spacecraft that had a different set of requirements and basically a new spacecraft and at each stage it has to operate completely successfully for an extended period of time even as the international space station was being assembled in orbit Spirit and Opportunity would soon Rove the Martian landscape but early in this new millennium we would endure a tragic reminder of the dangers of space travel and Columbia Houston we see your tire pressure messages and we did not come to your last at nine o'clock this morning Mission Control in Houston lost contact with our space shuttle Columbia short time later debris was seen falling from the skies above Texas the Columbia is lost there are no survivors NASA is been charged with advancing the technology and understanding of space flight for this country which means we're on the cutting edge of what can be done then we're going to be taking risk and spaceflight is one of the areas where we face risk on a daily basis and in the process of doing this we develop the new technologies new techniques the new inventions we make discovery this is what's going to keep us powerful and safe and secure and assure the economic vitality of our nation we actually put our many years of hypersonic research here at Langley into into work into a vehicle that actually flew with the HyperX program which was indeed an exciting exciting program this was put on a Pegasus booster taken up to test point and then released three two one launch launch sequences reset the x43 would acknowledge him we had two vehicles Mach 7 and then we had a mock Terry because we broke our own record the Mach 7 was the first record breaker and then we broke our own record with the Mach 10 as far as speed I had a great time working on airplanes and fighters and stuff the agency not only built and flew some very cool things we also had a lot of research that then got on to other airplanes we did a lot of work at that you know ultimately led to things that are on the f-22 and f-117 and maybe on the Joint Strike Fighter we don't build 747s and we don't build f-22 but we certainly did things that helped the companies that do build those kind of flight vehicles make their airplanes better three main engine start the reason we send unmanned spacecraft is to pave the way for humans the reason we've got spirit and opportunity on Mars is to tell us a little bit about what it's going to be like the things we're going to encounter when we get there because it's man's intellect its man's intelligence that she can never recreate this computer we intentionally made them so human we gave them 20/20 vision we gave them the ability to move around in an environment we gave them an arm so that they could reach out and touch things and then we used them to do exactly what we would do if we were there one thing that NASA gives us is is a very different perspective on the whole universe including our own world our own worlds place in it when we look at other worlds and we look through the eyes of a robot at a frozen desert we appreciate our own world so much more because we see what it could be like when they die it will be sad but they will have led such long and productive lives and will have died honorable deaths that I'll be at peace with it because of what they've done these are machines after all but you feel an emotional attachment put so much of ourselves into these things that when we lose them we'll lose a part of ourselves it'll be hard I really miss three engines up and burning three two one and liftoff of space shuttle Discovery beginning America's new journey to and beyond when you approach the space station it actually felt like it was enveloping you as you got closer because the size of it was so immense you could hardly take it in and all the windows or your peripheral vision and it seemed like it you were flying into a canyon like in Star Wars almost in it it totally surrounded you but it's a wonderful feeling to to see the space station coming up and it's being framed by the the earth below very beautiful views trying to distract you from your task of flying the space shuttle when you arrive on the International Space Station you know there's a little bit of a shock factor it was very odd when they closed the hatch and we weren't on that shuttle you saw them flying away and it was like wow we're really here man this is gonna be a long visit we get scheduled for approximately two hours of exercise a day and that's to try and counteract some of the negative effects of being in zero gravity on the musculoskeletal system and our cardiovascular system so that was an important aspect of every day that we're onboard in the station the crew members themselves are laboratory rats as if you will you know because we have a human research program trying to understand what happens to people when they're in space for long periods of time and so we participate in those experiments obviously I also think the space station offers an incredible laboratory we've added additional laboratory modules during expedition 16 and with their most recent addition on the last shuttle flight so it's gonna be I think a spectacular laboratory as well and I'm excited about what the future holds for us they're probably the biggest legacy of the International Space Station I think will be the International aspect the fact that we're doing this internationally and it's a huge technical accomplishment but I think the fact that we are overcoming these cultural obstacles and bringing these people together with this common goal I think is one of the most significant aspects of the International Space Station I believe that human beings should expand into space by doing that we can learn about ourselves and make the society and the world better by working together in a cooperative way we can bring the world closer together this is a great opportunity for Japan and other countries to be able to participate in a space program like the ISS NASA Labs are the pride of the world for things that we can do where science and engineers meet together and say let's do the impossible and and we'll do it our space projects are very demanding person has to work maybe night and day and weekends so when the schedule requires it to finish something on time we feel I feel that the entire world is watching us and waiting for us to do our thing and to get it right and it's a tremendous opportunity it's also tremendous responsibility and it's always been pretty clear that we do this together as teams and that it's the only way you could possibly do these amazing projects so I think we can be very proud of what we've accomplished we look back in history and when we think this country was founded in part by a scientist Ben Franklin and a future president on Thomas Jefferson who was very fond of science and so that would be so proud and thrilled to see what our country has accomplished with science and and the engineering miracles that have happened in consequence I think they never would have guessed but they would still be thrilled to see what's been done as NASA enters its sixth decade it's time to go back to the moon this time we'll go back not just for a few hours not for a few days but for good for the good of exploration innovation and inspiration for the good of humanity we will give NASA a new focus and vision for future exploration to gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare for new journeys to the worlds beyond our own we as a civilization must explore that's who we are intrinsically to the human races were explorers and unless we continue to explore we're going to falter as a civilization when we cease to be an explanation when we cease to seek knowledge and as questions that's the time we will wither and die on his plan I think it's significantly important that we look to the future Mars of course will be the next outpost I think will have people living on Mars 50 years from now what they'll be looking forward to I have no idea but I'm sure it'll be fascinating I'd like to see the mission to Mars they accomplished something I did some work on and making the proposal we made I think there's a consensus that going to Mars is a worthy objective and I'd like to see that accomplished perhaps at one time in the distant past the at least some basic life forms existed on Mars and perhaps could again in the future these things mean a lot to me I think space is important and I think America should continue to be in the forefront of space exploration no matter where you go in the world people know what the letters in a essay stand for they say NASA and they say it was recognition that in and of itself tells you that NASA stands for something in the world not just in America but across the world throughout all human history we've we've always had people look up and think you know the blue sky what is it up there do you what it would be like if we could go up there in our time our lifetimes we've gone up there you know here we are and develop that kind of a capability in our time what a great time to be alive the future mankind depends upon space travel if we stand earth will go on and having wars but if we go to the Moon and Mars will bind ourselves together into one single race one color and going to space and live forever remember remember you"

Disney’s Stunt Robots Could Change How Hollywood Makes Action Movies | Movies Insider",Disney’s Stunt Robots Could Change How Hollywood Makes Action Movies | Movies Insider,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZ950ywJy0M,0,1563681,22668,676,2795,nZ950ywJy0M,Disney has created robot acrobats that perform high-flying stunts sticking a perfect landing every single time these stunts Ronix are autonomous self-correcting and remarkably human-like so how does the technology work could it actually change the way Hollywood makes its blockbuster films and what do real stunt performers think about how this could affect their profession the stunt Tronics project began with a simple z shaped robot called stickman unveiled by disney's research team in May 2018 stickman consists of three links connected by hinges its legs can fold into a tuck to z configuration or unfold into a linear shape stretching seven feet long about the height of a human stunt performer who has his arms raised this tucking and untucking action allows stickman to adjust its speed of flight and perform aerial stunts such as a single backflip and a double backflip stickman is launched from an elevated height like this sealing a quick release clamp detaches the robot from the ceiling and it flies through the air along a pendulum to determine what its body is doing in space the robot processes data in real time from a number of onboard sensors a simpler version of the system used in self-driving cars it's equipped with three laser rangefinders which encounter the ground at different times these laser rangefinders measure stickman x' height in midair while a unit of accelerometers and gyroscopes measure orientation stickman uses this information to determine when it should talk and untuk allowing it to make a graceful landing every time from this stick-figure prototype disney created the more humanoid stunt Ronix which can control their own posture rotation and center of mass and can even strike dramatic superhero poses in midair the Sun Tronics were developed for Disney's themed attractions many of which already future human stunt performers as live entertainment beyond their use in theme parks people are speculating that sentronics will soon play behind the scenes roles in movies especially action and superhero movies that involve extreme stunt work the robots could be used to test out stunts for at least on performers like Bobby Holland Hampton Bobby is one of Hollywood's go-to stuntmen performing as a stunt double for actors like Chris Hemsworth Ryan Reynolds Christian Bale Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Evans while we're rehearsing our stunts for a movie we build up each stunt in increments and we start slow and build it up until the final product and it can take time but the reason we do that and take the time is because it's the saint's way to do it so we could potentially introduce a stunt robot to test the stunt for us to a point where we think okay well let's not keep beating up the human to get it right let's maybe use the stunt robot for a section of it and then when we feel it's ready to plug the human in we plug the human in or I mean it would actually make me a lot happier if I could get stunt robot to test up into a certain point of a stunt and then I'll just take the robot out I'll step in and do it maybe a couple of times and we're good to go so I mean it sounds good to me some people have voiced concern that the rapid advancement of robotics could threaten the jobs of actors and stop performers alike listen when you've got an actor like Chris Hemsworth I don't need any robot out there in the world that can be as good-looking as him I think the actors are pretty safe I certainly don't think that it's going to be a problem for some performers I think you always need the human element of anything and even when you know you work alongside the special effects teams they always need a human element even if they're going to CGI that later there's a place for everything I think it could help both sides special effects and not you know it sounds like an amazing bit of technology that could come into the film industry and and enhance it I don't think it's gonna change it but I think you could enhance it

terminate the battery be charged at 55 + 5 0 okay and at the same time I sure like to have a krauser Oh for tax let's wait till they get settle down a bit more Roger why jeans a go GNC ok would still like to re-enable the other two quads for the maneuver okay when rolling to 0 6 0 you want them to enable C and D right right you want them to disable and B no okay all for quad since you have a couple gentleman who garage copy cap down at it buddy and COO gone call a nice confirm their configuration on their high game now if I'll do that like know what track mode they're in and it won't serve electronics are in okay let's just stand by one they're a little CND for roll to 0 6 0 terminate battery be charged okay the third thing we want up that Capcom is to verify their high gain configuration and I assume what you want from there is you want to know they're tracking position of track beam what you don't need to you you want the whole works doodle-oo oh yes Capcom we want the configuration of the CSM high gain Apollo 13 Houston the next thing we'd like you to do is do class we'd like you to roll right to zero six zero and now your rate or photography of the comments Bennett to do that we'd like it to enable quad D and D for the maneuver use all your quads and in precisely one minute we'd like you to terminate the battery charge and battery be one of the quick request we'd like to have one other request we'd like to have you verify your high gain configuration we'd like to know what track mode what servo and what beam was okay Jack I heard the TV we were AutoTrack therapy with and a primary micronics excused okay and we had a good lock up just after we started the manoeuvre I was able to lock you up and get real good signal straight and it just hit that right there at about two hundred thirty nine degrees in yah that the signal strength l would just drop off and Yama go to zero and it would go to 90 in the TV show is a great flight G and say Oh Jen say we verify that they re enable C for thrusters okay I verify that they read your showing it disabled yet yes captain we're still saying C for thruster disabled yeah 13 we'd like you to be forthright account go you've got 40 amp hours back in battery B now okay you got it quite okay okay flight controllers I want to go around the horn and pick up anything you need configuration wise tell them you go ahead but you still worried about any configuration items negative the LEM heater current indicates that the level is properly closed out they apparently have not closed the LEM hatch yet okay so you're happy that you don't need them to verify that what is it activation to three of those pages we're on that's right it was TLC two and we're happy okay five guns go guidance we asked about the docking index again okay cap that'll get that falling Roger we see a dick and we got a reading of minus two degrees in the docking index we'd like to know that's 2.0 precise orbit 2.1 or 1.9 now if I might have a pointer over time okay got your answer guidance Roger Frank okay go with okay GNC you've got any configuration item set negative flight Capcom looks like the last item we need here is a stir on the h2 an o2 at their convenience okay 13 we've got one more item for you when you get a chance we'd like it to stir up your cryo tanks in addition I have adapted trying to okay for look at the comments Bennett if you need us okay flat guns go guys we finally got our Delta H update do you want to just read it up to the crew or a blanket let's see can we collapse dead bands and do all that good stuff if we uplink here yeah that's why we just rated at now if they enter it through the disk er they going to do it stem I want there we haven't stable out in that attitude yet so I don't think we're gonna have any pride I don't think there's any problem they haven't opened up dead bin yeah that's that's just what I'm saying the time to do it is now guidance fly again so guides as long as he's in poo and don't reselect it he can help link it our entering himself for a we can do do you didn't matter okay why don't you you gotta pass the data for the crew checklist anyway on board Dutch it right thought you got a page update or why don't we read it up to them and that'll serve both purposes alright both have mattered as well as watch tell them what made you want in the checklist okay flight domion go tell Tom we show the LEM overhead hatches closed in the Peter Kurten looks no okay five guns go guys we've had a hardware these I don't know wondering why I'm G&C you want to look at it see if I see any faults ROG we're copying a cap Kyle we see a hardware we stuck you see an AC bus undervolt guidance or decomp negative flight I believe the crew reported we're gonna main be undergo okay fellow we've got your instrumentation Feist let me let me add them up Raj okay standby 13 we're looking at it we may have had an imitation problem flight Raj so I did go gone cop we switched a white beam with death time here that brought me hold it down and we had a pretty large bang associated with the caution warning now the better call BB was the one that said I am spike on once before okay Roger bread Enco you say you want the wide beam with that juice let's see if we can correlate those times get the time when you want the wide beam there and go okay Roger do we have the floodlights often enough that Joe at the burger hut yeah we can determine that from left we now know fewer quantity to was are late that dan around twenty thirty percent now it will feel high and developed over a bag okay John the Papas try to reconfigure on it jack econ never seen any AC problems look like lady's got a lot of instrumentation problems are go Ahead's frame he's flipping our fuel cells around flying well let's get some recommendation here so if you got any better ideas sigh what do you want to do hold your own and be reading flipped right now sigh if you got a sig sensor type problem there what clay decon but he's got fuel cells 1 & 3 are offline we've got many volts we have no mangy vaults have attempt areia reconnect the fuel cells fuel cell 1 2 main a fuel cell 3 two main V okay you'll just RI that one back to main a fuel cell three back to main be main a three to main B let's see what happens okay now is there do we have instrumentation problem well we lost eight it does appear we've lost AC bus to a voltage main B is reading four volts and that effectively takes a seat away from us okay the yeah he reported wiper poles on the ROG on the fuel cell out of Archaea slander light let's see if we can get a DC back ROG go ahead G insane by that the quat delta helium valves are open now you're seeing an attitude problem are you seeing some buy levels that are giving you pronoun some low pressures in the fuel and oxidizer which would be symptomatic of the helium valve closing him and firing some jets rod number two helium valve 1 Delta quarter helium valve open right right Capcom do you want to verify the quad Delta helium valve is open please any other problems in the RCS but okay is that all we come up with for him we got any other recommendation yeah we wanted to get fuel cell one configured the main a fuel cell three two main B did you pass that up let's attempt that point we'd like to do attempt to reconnect at all this seems to be a suit that probably may be tied into that tie game thing again Delta is open we went went to Y being with flight at 55 55 oh four great legs but the bosons upon the clothes that copy fight a bit let me let me measure it on is there any kind of leads we can give them when we look at an instrumentation we got a real problem or what that's flighty con goeco let's reverse a configuration their request okay oh wait a minute we got our good main a bus let's make sure that whatever we do doesn't screw up main a fuse on main a flight I'm not going to ask to change that okay what do you want to do let's try to put fuel cell 109 B fuel cell 3 on main a we use the other sensing circuitry fuel cell number one on main B fuel cell three on main a we're not going to touch fuel cell to flight okay but if we get any problems in the system I want to make sure that we don't blow the voltage off main a and then we're not going to be able to see anything you got can we review our status here sigh and see what we've got from a standpoint of status what do you think we got in a spacecraft that's good main bus a is reading 25 volts ok main a and that's reflected by the fact fuel cell 2 is putting out 53 amps which is just about the most it can and keep your voltage up okay no that's bonafide AC bus 2 is zero which is reflected by the factory loss main big AC bus standby line zero output 20 count go ahead he come okay if we want to keep much standbys change configuration got battery a I'll maintain some good ideas here for you go ahead side so I was going to ask you put a battery on flame put it into going company down his row her hugging will drive that AC - okay you want Omni Bravo right you know think we're going to be able to get high bitrate data here do you onami we maybe we've got the 210 you got the 210 okay that'll save a bit of power Capcom elects recommend selection of Omni Bravo please it's Charlie now ok Mazari army charlie so it's relative 13 uses we need Omni charlie blue yeah okay fly we got Omni charleen high bitrate okay you have high but right now off the two tens right on the edge okay 20 count Joey calm okay let's get the read out on a couple fuel cell pressures here okay fuel cell 1 & 2 pressure fuel cell 302 pressure we're reading zero and two pressure and fuel cell 1 and 13 psi on a fuel cell 302 pressure okay you want fuel cell 1 & 2 pressure and two pressure fuel cell 3 what do you want there Oh two pressure Oh two pressure Capcom let's get those as a start 13 youth been five yeah no guidance operating 401 is hardware a star he was gonna clear the fine went over and that he should have killed it but they're still moving they ought to stop it are we using us now but okay nitrogen on one top 10 on to the creek negative oxygen on three okay G unsafe replied G&C from flight GNC did you see any problems in quite d helium valve does that look like that's cleared up ROG that cleared up flight we're in good shape okay now are we using RCS now that's affirmative we're going to have to switch them thrusters over to main a two-fold attitude here okay how much RCS we used all we've used yes 25 pounds okay give me a minimum fuel usage configuration that will keep me attitude ROG I told you go tell me the LEM heater currents become essentially static ROG that solve one problem at a time come back to me later on it shoemaker there's a pond fixed and the big and the other one he'll fill one that nitrogen Teresa Durrell Roger zero we confirm in those numbers that's her  I need that RCS stuff as soon as you can get it God's light he's turned off all jets now heaven okay we came up with those numbers flight okay sigh give me your next best thing to try he comes flight flight econ go ahead why don't we try to leave fuel cell two alone and just make sure that one and three are disconnected from both buses and make sure that there's absolute might be any load on them at all and let's see what happens at those cells okay what do you want to do open circuit fuel cell one and three that's for in-flight okay Capcom let's recommend we open circuit fuel cell number one and number three and leave fuel cell number two as is okay one two three open circuit two as is and earlier got a report from that one three were reading gray but zero flow yeah Capcom let's amend that he come from flight flight econ why don't we just open circuit of one and make sure that we don't have any problems getting that back onto the bus okay so watch it for a while before we make get it further moves with three Roger okay Capcom let's just open circuit one of those right now certain uses we'd like you to open circuits feel fill one leave two and three as is okay I'll get to work on that that's Roger slide SC as AC from Roger we our crew thinks are betting summer now did fly Roger we copy your venting copy that pleasure God rush okay let's everybody think of the kind of things we'd be vetting G&C you get anything that looks abnormal in your system negative light how about you econ you see anything that with the instrumentation you got that could be betting the line now jacket that right we did let's try it let me look at the system for the venting is concern okay let's start scanning I assume you've called in your backup he comes he calm flights again but you called in your backup becomes now see if we can get some more brain power unless we got one here Roger flood and go go and go he's never mind he's Suzy in a little bit okay okay now let's everybody keep cool we got limb still attached the limb spacecrafts good so if we need to get back home we got a limb to do a good portion of it with okay let's make sure that we don't do anything that's going to blow our CSM electrical power with the batteries or that will cause us to lose the main or the fuel cell number two okay we want to keep the o2 and that kind of stuff working we'd like to have RCS but we got the command module system so we're in good shape if we need to get home let's solve the problem but let's not make it any worse by guessing flight GNC go Gian see they have some jet configurations for you whatever you need am i okay given to me okay Charlie three Charlie for two main a Bravo three and Bravo for two main a Charlie one and Charlie to two main am I it's all the quad Charlie on Nene Kent Plus Bravo three and Bravo four what are we going to be doing with these gents Anil you know give us one jet in each direction in each axis okay flight guidance no guidance is getting close to gimbal lock Capcom okay Capcom recommend he bring up C 3 C 4 B 3 B 4 C 1 C 2 on main a and advise him he's getting close to gimbal lock 13 years we see again close the gimbal lock there with my guidance or flight brain go ahead could we go to a course align on the platform here so we don't have to use any gas if we need to also bring be very orient if necessary now it's going to recommend a piece 52 and a little pretty now it's going to take a while before we get to the point where even thinking of a b-52 yeah it'll course the line itself there want it 30 days did you read it of course aligned at 85 itself no we get it okay can you tell us anything about the venting worth coming from what when do you see that it's coming out a one-to-one right now jack could you give me the thrusters again okay the thrusters with what we like on main a we like Charlie one two three and four also Bravo three and four on Nene okay got it okay calm level coming back to you flight go ahead I think the best thing we can do right now is start a power down okay let's go down to the emergency 1-5 you want it on let us look at the TM and all that good stuff and then come back up that's from flooded to Omni Bravo you want Omni Bravo again right onboard Omni Bravo Capcom recommend Omni Bravo room okay what do you want to go to power down give me the stage burn c1 - Firefly will go down drag you to Delta of 10 amps reject reduction what they will get on the Bravo flight he calmed you want to go through that again what do you want to power down to I want to power down a total of 10 amps like a total of 10 apps that's firm okay Capcom we'd recommend emergency power down checklist 1-5 we want to power down a total or a delta of 10 amps from where we are now flight GNC go Jin say we afford to do a PTC first and then we shut off all of that stuff with no problems uh-oh I think you're going to have a thermal problem here well we could have I stay there too long okay we'll run into that one later puck okay I want to get our major problem sorted out now you want this to one one day I've done it 1-5 power down Delta ten amps Capcom okay 13 this is Houston we'd like you to go to your identity checklist to pink pages 1-5 to power down until we get a delta of 10 amps over all right he comes from flight so fine you don't want to get fuel-cell pumps off do you optics power is already off I believe we can do that on fuel cell number one flight ok well let's make sure we don't blow the whole mission okay say again that stereo not the one okay we'd like you to go down that power down procedure until you get a delta of ten amps over slight econ going down would you not want to consider going to PTC well why don't we get this problem here resolved right now eight our power down a thing but should a tower power down I'd hope but it well the expect that we're going to be in a thermal problem for the next many hours become well I don't know where theta Sun is right now flight well looks pretty close to quad-a right now we got ninety degrees your copy or I don't know exactly where it's between a and B mostly on ice that's in your system checklist page 1-5 and 13 you might also check for those pages in your lawn checklist cnc for plighted bank pages 1-5 and we'd like to do ki NC for flight Kenzi I prefer not to make any unnecessary maneuvers now or try to use any of the equipment's onboard the spacecraft such things as CMC that type stuff until we nail down what our problem is well that's why I was recommending PTC because we don't need any of that stuff then heaters or anything else yeah but you got to get the CMC on and keep it online and you need a rather precise period of time for rate damping there oh the order of 20 minutes to damp out and then sped up and then we can do without any of that if we get a good spin up going in first okay that might be a good idea that it buys some more time from a standpoint of reviewing the data and there to get us back into the as close to the normal flight plan as we could how far we are attitude right now is a fair ways out right now fighting it to another verb 49 and fly back and then stabilize there flighty calm mr. Joey calm okay I need one thing right now he's powering down he's down to 41 amps total spacecraft I'd like to get my AC to bus back so I can look at o2 tank to pressure I have no insight into that okay let's get I guess we can put the inverter three two main a AC - let me just do a temporarily before you do that would you like to make sure you got all AC load you don't need isolated from the bus now let's not do that right now fine I think we're in good shape that way the main a is up high enough where it can handle the inverter fair concerns me is starting is throwing equipment we had a problem we don't know the cause of the problem right I've got a feeling we've lost two fuel cells I hate to put it that way but I don't know why we've lost them it does an OL tag up and it's not an instrumentation problem the best I can tell right now okay I'll tell you what let's discuss this for just a little bit longer their psyche Capcom started moving back towards a PTC attitude let's start them going in to his rate damping I feel it's going to be a relatively long period of time to try and nail down the problem go ahead he's asking now do we like his amperage setup right now are you happy with his power level right now Roger we copy be back do it flip flight info but I like to put him to secure the high gain for he stars in the PTC whatever it is back there correct carts stabilizers how do they do we're trying to pick a brief again did you pick up any tips her that's first yes it what's firing that you got something firing while we've seen violent quite a bit of trust or activity okay I guess this kills the PTC too because we're not going to get into PTC as long I got something betting that's like that agrees are interesting yeah flighty calm Joey calm I go little correction let's put inverter one on both AC buses please further the one on both AC firm so I can get some AC bus power back so I can have some insight into my AC bus to telemetry especially my crowds may be demanding may be coming from that and also I think that the fuel cell two pumps are on AC two and this will take care of it without switching the pumps yet say that again you think you'll kill salt pumps yeah fuel cell two pumps I think run AC - okay but according to the checklist he should have powered he should have turned those off right how he said he was down to be mag number two is in warmup so he's already gone through the fuel cell non-stop good enough okay so you want to configure inverter one on both AC buses that's from Flint flight I didn't go heading to the spacecraft and I didn't pass up inverter three to maintain AC - did you and delete yeah we deleted that alright you want to put inverter one on both AC buses become and Capcom let's do it okay thirteen years and we need to get some more instrumentation up we'd like you to put them because we like both a slight II can't monitor this bear when we switch it in tell me and control from flight go fine will you take a look at Dover launch data and go through your system see if there's anything you've got that may have started bending here that's Roger fine okay and I want to report in that in about the next 15 minutes quick look type stuff okay flight battle go final four definitely see an event the data raj we copied that capcom fuel cell flight account go ahead fuel cell to pump Stacy one you want fuel cell to pump to AC one permit Epcon fuel cell to pumped AC one okay Fred we want the fuel cell to pump AC one please okay he comes like 20 calm you got anybody getting a D log in this thing downstairs network from flight flight network bring me up another computer in the RTCC well we got one machine on the RTCC and we got Dulce peas downstairs ok I want another machine up in the RTCC and I want a bunch of guys capable of running D logs down there Roger that light did you hear him say he's getting some rates we want to know if he's barn any thrusters ROG GNC watch those thrusters with CNC say again have you got any thrusters firing while we're looking at that c3 trust or flight that looks like it stays on most of the time well can we turn them all off and see if we still got the rates or any build-up and rates well the rate that we're seeing is opposite to the direction of that thruster so if anything that's just trying to hold and not quite up to okay but he's been trying to counteract the rates with direct he's been getting a negative pitch in a negative rope okay but he asked if we were getting some thruster firings that were not being made by in I'll tell you what GNC can you get somebody in the back room to try to figure out what the equivalent Delta V is we're getting so that we can see if we can backtrack to see if we can figure out what's betting now there it's it would seem we could equate that to effective thrust and an axis and then deduce what Svenning rods we'll give it a try flight okay and that might be of interest to the LEM guys he also said it was coming past window number one that's real that lead on me Charlie Omni Charlie Capcom eagerly please 13 he come from flight what did a okay you got two good AC buses what did all that tell you now it tells me that well just give me about two more minutes fly okay take your time okay thirteen we've got lots and lots of people working on this we'll get you some dope as soon as we have it and you'll be the first one to know come back okay we're configuration we're sitting now install we still have the probe drove inside the command bars all we're going to stay a mystery kind of give us an Okie then reinstall the probe with drone Raj can tell I tell me we copy Roger fight pronto go final two machines the RTCC okay slight G&C goujian seen it would like to turn it truster alpha-3 on main a and see if that will help control that pitch and at the same time we can turn off Charlie three two okay give me some real-time plotting and how we're using RCS here we have rods flight in the pitch axis we really don't seem to be using any and that's why it would like to go to alpha and see if that changes it inning okay now what do you want again thruster alpha 3 2 main a alpha 3 to lane a Capcom you want to pass that up to the crew please 13 we like to have you put the thruster alpha 3 unmanned Amy please give me a gross amount of RCS propellant consume so far GNC Roger flight it'll take 30 seconds okay that's affirmative flight we're Scott below the limits flight econ go he come we've really got to get that battery off the line and power down some more and we've got to get some main B power back so we can build our pressure back up an o2 tank 1 it's a down at 318 psi C was on the way down we have no we have no heaters in o2 tanks hey what do you want to power down well where DC you get down to be Mac to off not inclusive that's affirmative B mag 2 is in a warm up yeah I think we'll go ahead and turn that down so we had still had the limb with us right that's affirmative if we shut down the SES we ought to be a little better off perhaps I think we ought to press on and go down through be Mac to off and get those lights minimum okay how much you want a bar down another 10 amps let's go develop it to be man go get the lights down to a minimum let's go down to more steps okay Capcom we want to power down a little bit more want to get the B nag off and lights from them there 13 is Houston we'd like to power down just a little bit more so let's get steamed egg 2 and make sure you light their down okay lights are gonna be back just level it off okay so now how long do you want to leave this battery online I want to try to get off as quick as I can but I powered down the crew did report they remove fuel cell three open a open circuited it also denied I don't believe so fuel cell one and fuel cell three should be open circuited we just had our last call for feel so one open circuit and we left you'll tell Korea's wood miles take this open circuit fuels health and circuit fuel saw three get it off the bus flight jeans evenly I could do open her revealed Beltre calling flight Sagan this gmz flight go ahead here we've used a total of about 70 pounds RCS would like to change the jet configuration and see if that will help us out any okay what do you want to try now they would like to turn the problem jets all to the off and all Delta to maintain their an all Bravo off and Delta domain a right rods they'll verify that it isn't a Bravo thruster that's causing the problem attitudes okay Capcom we'd like to turn all Bravo Jets off and all Delta Jets domain a Roger flight account go recount let's take battery a off the main we can support the that's fan out on the one fuel so even with the cryo to going down that's that's affirm flight okay what's your worry level and cryo to see again fine okay you want up I want to save the battery flight okay see what battery we got on right side say again what battery we got online very alpha flight battery a oh yeah next step of course will wear then think we got to worry about getting some power I'll main be to get the pressure back up no two tank one garage turn battery a off Capcom 13 Houston turn battery a all flighty calm Joey calm that my sweet search tank also and save it we used to crowd as much as we can say that again let's isolate the search time by that and module I don't understand that sighs I don't want to I want to use the cryo as much as possible but that would seem to be the opposite if you want to keep the fuel cell going the fuel cells are fed off the tanks in the service module flight to search tank is in the command module we want to save the surge tank in which we need for entry okay I'm with you I'm with you Roger Capcom let's also isolate the surge tank okay you want to isolate the surge tank yeah ho do surgery yeah what we're really doing is secure on our entry systems right now thirteen Houston we'd like you to isolate your o2 third tank thank off now death okay Jack are you copy Oh what property yeah like we're trying to figure out some way to get power on bus being we're trying to get the power to that tank then by we're working on he comes from flight he come from flight any kind but you consider put a battery battery on Busbee long enough to get the pressure up well I'm trying to I want to determine whether or not the five amps is going to hurt us any that's going to be in Maine a in Stanley I made a mistake Oh to tank one he's her main a we got Maine a with a seven or Clady come go he come okay since o2 tank one heaters are on main a and we've got them off now we'll be able to stand the five amps temporarily for a manual pressurization let's have them turn the heaters on manually no.2 tank one oh and we'll want to Russia tanks cryogenic o2 heater water flight the flight we copy that no problem no problem Capcom Capcom we want to get cryo to tank number one heater on Roger copy them and we'd like to build up the pressure and co2 tank one so turning heaters on manually we watch the pressure for you you can stand the five amps on main a that's honor we think so flight I realize that we building a Santa five more Anton okay okay did you see your five amp increase in current 30.com that's firm flight okay twenty six point seven volts looks good we'll watch that pressure flight to be consistent we ought to isolate the repress package also okay wanna isolate repress but AFD per flight that way get on air guys full time in the backroom keeping track the spacecraft configuration as we pass it up to the crew you might use a Larry why don't you stay on get Larry in the backroom to keep track of configuration stuff we give it to the girl okay and we've got the voice recorder and we're starting to transcribe that okay now has anybody started a dialogue of the initial problem you've got a deal are gone if you got people that are going to be in a position to evaluate it okay tell them you and control from flight go fine Roger I want Lim Manning around the clock Roger lady can go ahead he come I want the fans on in the o2 tank one we're not seeing a pressure increase we can stand it you can stand it that's right fans on in tank one right from the flight Capcom and you want to bring the fans on a Nespresso Am flight okay okay he's got an M seen W for varied reasons 13 Houston we'd like you to additionally bring on the fans in o2 tank 1 and we can spend the additional amperage on it to bring up a fan flighty and safe go ahead G and say it looks like the vehicle stabilized considerably over the last few minutes okay that could mean one of two things either whatever was venting is stop venting it's empty or do you feel it could also be associated with the trustor quad Bravo we just isolated its possible flight we really don't know yet though okay are we essentially in a can you figure out what orientation we are from a standpoint of thermal control assume what's our rate right now well right now he has a minus tenth of a degree in pitch and yaw enroller very close to zero okay flighty Khan Gardi copy the pressure and o2 tank one is all the way down to 297 you better think about getting in the lab or using the lung systems I'm going to have to power way down I don't know if I'm gonna be able to save the o2 for the third fuel cell for fuel cell two rather the heaters aren't working now let's start thinking circuit breakers you got a so that brick as you want to check there we saw the current flight you saw the current okay look let's check it anyway for you right it looks like it's cycling up a PC up come from 297 to 302 take some circuit breakers to check okay panel 226 try Jenna co2 heater one main a circuit breaker I'm sorry I didn't catch you there cryo Oh to tank one panel Oh 26500 to heater one main a panel 226 also flight let's let's check the fan motor circuit breakers tank one on panel 226 also loader cryo fan motors tank one there are three circuit breakers three-phase get that Capcom I've got the 226 cryo to heater one main a and cryo fan motors tank 1/3 of month that's right all three phases he calm I don't think we're going to come down a solution here until we get back to the initial set of condition so I hope you got a set of guys looking at the D log pretty soon battle through 26 trial Oh - heater number one main a and check the three cryo fan motor Bank one tell me you from flights go ahead plate I want you to get some guys figuring out minimum power in the LEM sustain life Roger okay react breaker three red breaker open alder after closed okay bread thank you got the circuit breakers all in flight Raj copy all circuit breakers in Jack looking outside the upper particles to may upgrade the rider Jack thank you we copy 20 count so heady cop don't we have both be mags off Capcom would you verify that both be mags are off please and 13 we'd like to verify that both be mags are off please all right negative we just have one beeping you want to bring it off ready come come in if I have time let's get it off okay Jack let's take B mag one off Capcom's from flight well you get a cockpit panel on to lay out and have the crew just get the thing and as have the crew read across to all instruments all gauges and write down exactly what they've read in those things okay you want a survey of panels one and two on gauges yep okay and talkback that's affirmative figure out some code that you can use and I think that's something we should have got started a while ago 13 is used by product you to give us a survey of your displays on MBC's wanted to give us the gauge reading then talk see that juice is still going down there he comes we've got any more suggestions to lady come any more suggestions and try to pump up o2 tank one pressure now flight we're going to hit a hundred psi in an hour and 54 minutes that's the end right there okay 100 psi less than two hours now one Oh Fido flight go ahead slide whatever planning it do I want to do assuming that we're going around the moon and we're using the limb for performing the maneuver because in the present configuration unless we get a heck of a lot smarter I think we're wasting our time planning and using the SPS okay fine so I think all of our returned earth type planning should be assuming the use of the lamb tips and our RCS and I think third party down the line should be CSM RCS and I'm assuming you'd want fastest possible return yeah I think that's the case okay we'll work on it from the sidelines fly okay it'd be no problem I'll copy that flat plenty calm go ahead he come okay listen there is a possibility that we blew a line in one of the fuel cells and it's effectively manifold it there of course now I want to shut off one of the reactant valves to one of the fuel cells and that would be fuel cell 3 since it's o2 pressure is gone now fuel cell ones O 2 pressure is trying to stay up there at 45 psi maybe the problem is in fuel cell 3 that sounds like a good assumption right there yeah fuel cell 3 is lost anyways far as flight G and C go G and say turn Charlie 1 thruster off you want to turn shyly one off while now looks like we're getting a lot of firing out throughout no reason gate Capcom recommend thruster c12 off thirty I can fight trustor c12 off so you want to do up now see one off I had it a word in there turn truster see one off the secondary ready he comes from flight flight he can watch you show me where you think that problem is okay class coming up I call it that but you my calendar but very on about 20 Oh or one revenue right now we got a No flighty calm go ahead econ we need to get the make sure the inline heaters for fuel cells 1 & 3 are off zero he comes from flight you ought to shut off both reactant valves two fuel cell number everything anyway flight okay and in line here's off in fuel cells one and three please what we're proposing is supposing here Capcom as we may have a had some problem in fuel cell number three since that's the one that's reading no oh - right and we may be losing our o2 through fuel cell number three the o2 manifold and as much as their manifold together commonly looks like do two and fuel cell one and two seem to be trying to stay up there and fuel cell three looks like it's the oddball here Capcom let's close the reactant valve to fuel cell number three okay close reaction valve to if you saw amber three and you're saying that one two look okay well what it looks like it looks like the pressure is trying to stay up there and this is the best guess we've got right now because we got to stop this o2 flow okay flight fiance Cody and see more jet reconfiguration to see if we can hold the attitude okay I'd like to turn Charlie - aw why are we interested in holding attitude if we're not betting on that drift for a while that probably better from a standpoint of thermal control anyway wouldn't it I think we'd like to get into a control drift rather than just some random thing flight primitive close the react valve on seal belfry you want him to go through that whole smash for fuel cell shutdowns I assume you do heaters naw econ that's firm flight he's gone too much of it already by the pumps off okay you want them to go through the whole fuel cell shut down heater on all heaters reactive valves and the pumps course he's already got okay have them go ahead cap go and get the in my ears off on fuel cell one also fly-in lion heaters off and fuel so I Jewell cut to current requirement down that way you'll sell one we want you to go through the fuel cell shut down procedure on fuel cell three Rebecca okay cut down the Emma her calm holding up sound like he's going out how you doing there and come from a standpoint of Omni switching we might be a little bit of room Bravo okay can you figure me out some way to keep communications and you've cut down a bit in the load room you might talk to you come on it okay we can turn the tape recorder off key concepts like plenty count you don't need the tape recorder do you heck no let's get it off it may be already off but that's one thing we don't need let's go down the list as much of that inko stuff we can get fight I think that's about the one biggie right there there's that only thing we give up we've turned the power and falls we won't get out of it ready Capcom from fight go it's also verified tape recorders off placement ok I think we I don't think we got down that far in the listed way we ought to the B mags and that was lights B mags and lights and I think we stopped right there yeah yeah it's from flight tape recruit with skip a stepping of the tape recorder off we'd like to find you verified at the tape recorders office AFD meat recovery which every loo what does that cap come week everything what does that guidance he had a no 618 in kidding get rid of he's get rid of in there okay flight final okay flight I had them reading off a lot of gauge readings and we got over to fuel cell three and I hope your people are copying all this down did you get it some kind of master we got it on tape I'm sure we can put it off the tape that's affirm nights I have 94 95 percent of one's house cat flight final go far open assistance men can stand it I need two minutes for checkpoint to save all this data I don't see why we couldn't eat calm GNC can you stand a checkpoint right now only takes a minute I guess I'll have to if we need it fine yeah I think it'd be good to get a checkpoint go ahead econ have you deduced anything have you seen your reactant valves go off have you seen flow cease can't tell flight they're open circuited and the pressure still appears to be going down yeah negative light slightly calm Joey calm we better confirmed that the fuel cell three reactive valve circuit breaker and panel 226 was closed when he shut those fuel cell three reactant circuit breaker in what metal two to six to nominally open okay good idea you want to close the circuit breaker yeah the valve and yep yeah yes why you should have got a bar pulling on yeah wouldn't he get a barber Paul when he turned the reactance off he come from Flint even with the circuit breaker open no no okay so he ought to know that you can just verify the to get up okay fly we ever checkpoint okay all flight controllers I'd suggest just start handing over because I think a fresh team is probably going to be thinking clearer I think the rest of us can continue working in some other function in support of the new team coming on go on thruster a for flight okay Dominic surely float Roger it Omni Charlie I can't stop it okay okay Jack bring a four on staff refrigerator okay that got it and 13 we need Omni Charlie please hop it charlie and Fred I would like to have you verify fuel cell reactions the talkback is barber poles that's pop I watched it then it doesn't bubble poll as I threw the switch okay all flight controllers I'm handing over to Glenn I assume the majority of other team guys are pretty much briefed and up to speed as best we can now what I suggest is the white team do two things they go over the D logs okay let me go back over this again we're heading over to Glen I'd suggest a white team goes back and starts going through the d log of the data in other words let's see if we can go back to the initial conditions and work on that problem to see if we can find out what happened and we may find some better clues as to what to do and let the French guys come on and try to figure out where do we go from here and the D log is in a way now Roger you
moonlanding,Why is the flag flying in the wind? Where are the stars? We put the lunar landing conspiracy theories under the spotlight with former government UFO i. Follow us on twitter at http://twitter.com/itn_news,Moon Myths: Hoax theories analysed,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObWqK9IYZ08,-1,25456,90,53,378,ObWqK9IYZ08,one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century or the single greatest hoax ever pulled probably the first one but we wanted to be sure well I work for government for 21 years at the Ministry of Defense I spent three years investigating UFO sightings and through that I learned an awful lot about psychology of belief and particularly conspiracy theories whether it's moon landings JFK assassination Diana more recently 9/11 people love the idea that the government is putting one over on so our first thing that Flags surely that's fluttering in the wind there is no wind on the moon well what's happening is the astronauts are moving it around trying to actually get it in now because there is virtually no atmosphere on the moon there's there's no air resistance so once you move something it carries on moving that the fact that there's all sorts of shadows around here might suggest that that looks like an old film set that's a Hollywood basement right there one of the arguments is shadows point in different direction but I think that if you are dealing with a surface which is not even you'll often find that shadows aren't exactly parallel and this is something that people can actually test for themselves so don't take my word for it try it for yourself well we might have to space is full of stars why can't we see the Stars most of the things that people were taking photos and films of on the moon were actually quite reflective to take those images the shutter speed has to be very very quick and you don't get the stars I mean an analogy would be if you stood under a streetlamp and took a photo of the night sky you wouldn't see the start now a moon rock photographed on the later Apollo 16 s mission marked with a see if this was done in a film studio you think wouldn't you that you would take something so obvious off in the first place so in in well you would and then in fact that defeats the argument now my favorite response from any of those astronauts to these hoax theories is Buzz Aldrin of course he'd punch somebody in the face for fear of buzz punching me in the face I'm going to give it to the astronauts yeah so Nick you're clearly a government stooge sent here to confuse us even further but you've done a very good job bit well I may have worked for the government but I know my science find it you know quite insulting to people who have put their lives on the line or actors

George crater located on a mountain slope above Hadley rail to the south of the landing site this is really a rock'n'roll ride in it there would be a stop to collect samples at a smaller trader called elbow then arrival at the base of st. George and a look into Hadley rim oh look at that oh look back Scot then adjusted the television antenna on the rover a quarter of a million miles away in Houston's Mission Control a flight controller operated the television camera mounted on the rover scientists and engineers on earth could directly monitor the lunar exploration and those of us at home watching on television felt like the third astronaut on the moon the astronauts began to collect samples and photograph the area the samples would consist of rocks picked up with a rake like device soil samples selected rocks and chips taken from boulders they would also drive core tubes into the lunar soil to collect contiguous specimens from beneath the surface but now it was time to return to the lunar module not to end this first work period on the lunar surface but to begin another phase I can't believe we came over we did visit the beautiful little Valley get those big belts to fly over are they after returning to the lab to load equipment they moved to a nearby location to set up a science station similar to those left on previous mission with the establishment of these experiments a network of scientific stations was achieved which would allow triangulation of events and give us the ability to locate precisely the origin of lunar events as they work one of their instructions was to throw the packing as far as possible from the site Dave Scott lovely well we've been a demonstration hub by the way it started out to be up gravity and it they wound up being over centrifugal force I think using an electric drill Scott sank a tube into the lunar soil into which a probe would be placed to measure heat flow in the lunar material the difficulty in drilling would delay placement of the second probe until the next day the science station was then activated and Scott and Irwin closed Falcons hatch on Evy a number 160 miles above the moon al worden orbited in the command module endeavour operating experiments his observations adding to the wealth of scientific data already accumulated okay look it right down electrode now had a very interesting thing looks like a whole field of political center the detection of cinder cones clearly a volcanic origin helped solve another element of the controversy about how much of the moon was formed by volcanoes and how much by meteoroid impact worden was operating a series of experiments in the scientific instrument module these included a mapping camera to shoot lunar features and simultaneously the star field for accurate location of these features a panoramic camera a laser altimeter for accurate topographical mapping and the series of experiments to analyze the chemical makeup of the lunar crust in the estimation of a number of scientists this orbital research station would provide the most important information collected during the mission August first Scott and Irwin prepared for their second day on the moon and as Scott checked the inoperative forward steering of the rover their destination was the base of the Apennine front here they hope to find some of the basic substance of the lunar Highlands then they began the physical sampling of the Apennine front stopping at four craters in their Traverse okay let's go to work look at that oh I'll see putting in there guess what we just found I think we found what we came for Crystal Rock Desert you better believe it to the untrained eye it looked like just another rock but it's large crystals formed in pairs called twinning showed it to be a section of primal lunar crust formed during the earliest history of the solar system not obliterated by billions of years of impacts and lava flows it was a key to many mysteries was the early lunar crust molten why differences in color and density between the Highlands and lowlands nicknamed the Genesis rock it stands as a major clue in unraveling the formative processes of the moon's the earth and the planets click this bag number 196 a special bag yes sir those traitors ago Boyd and there might be diamonds in the necklace then we saw another practical use of television in lunar exploration babe you're gonna want to cinch up Kim's collection bag softly before you go much longer it's coming a very loose there okay let me do it right now Jones don't so I don't forget it not your we sure don't want to wait back up I don't know what the Rajat oh okay Jim let's get other over it get back hey we're on our tracks Roger and following home they go out and eat rotten today we can't spend some more time on your next trip a nice trip you're right what do you expect that traveling up tomorrow they returned to the science station where Scott once more manned the drill to place the second heat flow probe and later to get a deep core sample the difficulty in drilling was shown by Scotts hand which would carry bruised fingernails from his efforts for several weeks after the mission KKK car you've got just one minute of drilling left and over it was time to get back into the LEM and ndv a tooth the drill and attached sections were left in the ground for removal during the next day's Traverse on earth scientists pored over data from the television from the astronauts descriptions and from the orbiting experiments the 1,400 photographs the crew would return with themselves constitute a major scientific legacy lunar exploration was achieving a new maturity we are now exploring to test new hypotheses and the pieces were fitting together one scientist when asked why he didn't sit down and rest after an around-the-clock session replied I can't I'm too excited and the site they'll meet you up and to the drill she has left her friend now it's our friend now yes Capri she took guitar shoulder under that their first stop was at the drill they had left during the second DVA this core tube was the deepest sample ever collected from the moon perhaps the deepest we would ever get eight and a half feet beneath the surface cutting through fifty-eight distinct layers this would not only tell us more about the lunar structure but contained in this soil were traces of particles emitted by the Sun billions of years ago which would give us a clue to the early years of the solar system but now it was time to leave the core tubes to be picked up later and head west northwest to the rim of Hadley rail look at that real how about that I could see maybe you did very well of the fine players within that unit yeah all right I rock then Scott and Irwin descended a short distance over the rim of Hadley rills to get a piece of one of the large blocks thought to be lunar bedrock Connecticut under the bed Roger all closed so you can bet big ship another boy Rock me Rebecca they buckled their seatbelts for the ride back to the lunar module look at the mountain today Jim when they're all Sun lit hitting that beautiful yes by golly that no unreal I'm reminded of a favorite biblical passage from Psalm I'd look after the hills from whence cometh my help of course we get quite a bit from Houston - after stopped to pick up the core samples they returned to the LEM to close out their final traverse but first Scott would make history canceling a stamp on an interplanetary envelope I'm very proud to have the opportunity here to play postman but could be a better place to cancel the stamp then right here sadly real then a demonstration of a classic experiment I have a feather in my right hand a hammer I guess one of the reasons we got here today was because of a gentleman named Galileo long time ago who made a rather significant discovery about falling objects and gravity fields and we thought that there would be a better place to confirm his findings on the moon and so we thought we'd try it here for you and the feather happens to be appropriately a falcon feather for our Falcon and I'll drop the two of them here and hopefully they'll hit the ground at the same time how about that correct and his fighting finally Scott drove the rover away from the LEM so that its TV camera could pick up a picture of the coming liftoff as the spaceport rifling would say we're ready for you to come back again to the home cement on the cool green hills of Earth 171 hours and 37 minutes after they had lifted off the planet Earth Scott and Irwin would lift off its sister planet accompanied by a musical salute they themselves would provide from a small tape recorder onboard free throws he cooks food writer we have like the winner and my goodness I will appeal the real you the rendezvous and docking procedures were flawless right on the money but their jobs were not over here they would spend two more days in lunar orbit gathering data from the experiments and photography one more day around the moon than any preceding mission on August 4th they prepared to come home but even on their last orbit of the moon they had another experiment a very pretty satellite out there they placed in orbit a sub satellite the first ever launched by a manned spacecraft it was designed to circle the moon for a year measuring variations in lunar gravity the strength and direction of interplanetary and earth magnetic fields and the flow of charged particles in space tracking stations have acquired the satellite oh very good then the burn to bring them back to earth but their jobs were far from over 172 thousand miles from Earth al worden left the spacecraft to retrieve the eight thousand feet of film contained in the cassettes of the experiment bay cameras later they would turn their x-ray spectrometer toward the newly discovered x-ray pulse ours those mysterious black holes in space at the same time in accord with the previous plan an earth-based Soviet Observatory scanned the same areas visually to help derive a model consistent with both sets of observations during the trip home the x-ray spectrometer would observe seven x-ray sources and gather 50 hours of galactic data then on August 7th they looked into the fireball created by the heat of their re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere at 25,000 miles per hour and there would be a heart-stopping moment as one of the three parachutes collapse however the landing system was designed to use two parachutes the third parachute was an added safety factor today that margin paid off the success of Apollo 15 had been spectacular the scientific results have been almost unbelievable in the words of one scientist a five for one mission yet while we rejoice in our success we cannot afford to forget the sometimes painful efforts that gave us these achievements spacecraft commander Dave Scott I think many people have contributed to this pinnacle we've reached some have contributed more than others and we know of 14 individuals who contributed all they had and because of that or we left a small memorial on the moon about 20 feet north of Rover one and a small subtle crater there's a simple plaque with 14 names and those are the names in alphabetical order of all the astronauts and cosmonauts who have died in the pursuit of exploration of space near it is a small figure representing of fallen astronaut we went to the moon as trained observers in order to gather data not only with our instruments onboard but with our minds I'd like to quote a statement from Plutarch which I think expresses our feelings since we've come back the mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be lighted you"

The flat earth theory is not just a theory, it's a reality.  I share absolute proof in this video that the flat earth theory is true.  The round earth theory has been a convenient little conspiracy theory for long enough, but the truth must now set us free upon our beautiful flat world.

the fact that the flag was 2 feet tall equals 4 feet so 4 feet is how much lower the top of the flag should have been an if the earth was round I never should have been able to see it but I could see it because the earth is flat does that make sense I thought I'd be able to erase it I guess I need new cardboard now they say the globe is spinning at a thousand miles an hour if that were true we would all fly off and then they say well gravity is what keeps you on well gravity isn't even real thing so it's not what keeps you attached to the globe gravity is just an anecdotal wet dream of Isaac Newton you can't even prove that it exists and that proves that it doesn't exist gravity was just a ploy to validate his false theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun and we don't fly off the spinning globe because it's not spinning and it's not a globe don't get me started on Neil deGrasse Tyson he's an astronomer and astrophysicist who thinks he can just jump on Twitter and use scientific calculations and evidence to prove the earth is round I literally feel sorry for him because of how illogical he is first of all Neil I don't even play music second of all you misspelled the word dude and the fact that you can't even spell simple words correctly completely discredit everything else you've ever said in your whole career third of all you should never trust somebody who capitalizes the third letter in a second last name while on capitalizing the first letter he's a freemason I'll set you straight on this the Sun and the moon are the same size the Sun isn't 93 million miles away and 400 times bigger than the moon they look the same size because they are the same size it's the ultimate trickery record had around that the moon is actually a self-illuminating translucent disc not even made out of solid matter and I'm offended if you think we ever actually landed on the moon Magellan allegedly sailed around the world circumnavigating it if you will the he was going in a giant circle the whole time not going around the globe from 1519 to 1522 stupid son of the  was making a giant left-handed turn the whole time he was sailing that's what made him think he was going around the world he didn't even know how to sail in a straight line that doesn't sound like a very Seiler to me the only argument round earthers have is the line they always say the earth is not flat the easiest way to disprove this argument is to cross off the word not so very theory that the Flat Earth theory is an incorrect theory is in reality easily disprovable think about it the earth is not flat the subconscious mind doesn't pick up negatives so what round earthers are actually telling us is that the earth is flat checkmate round earthers pictures of the Earth from space are fabricated by NASA they're full of your regularities because they keep trying to change how they want you to think the earth looks look at these two alleged pictures of the Earth from space they're completely different like do they just think I'm so dumb that I wouldn't notice the irregularities these photos are frauds put out by NASA what's most wrong in this world is NASA Copernicus Galileo and all their heliocentric propaganda Copernicus was a freemason and so is everybody at NASA in Freemasons want to keep you completely in the dark about what the true shape of the world is why would they want to fool you into thinking the earth is round I don't know and that's why it's so scary be sure to flatten your world by subscribing to my youtube channel

 the pool party, Trey. Math homework
 is way more fun! Computer,
 that's the first thing you've ever said
 that doesn't add up. (canned laughter) You're so studious, Computer. Trey, you could learn
 a thing or two from his people. They're very wise. (canned laughter) Whoa, time out! (whistle blowing) Here we go again! TV and movies are rampant
 with Asian stereotypes. Especially the idea
 that Asian people are some kind
 of ""model minority."" Smart, successful, polite,
 obedient, and of course, inherently good at math. What's the big deal?
 Those are all compliments. Well, these ""compliments""
 actually originated in a government
 propaganda campaign. And not too long ago,
 white Americans actually thought
 the exact opposite. Time in! (whistle blowing) In the mid-1800s, Americans were so hostile
 to Chinese people, the country passed laws
 banning Chinese immigration and denying their freedoms. They were stereotyped
 as a lazy, opium-addicted, menacing horde dubbed
 the ""yellow peril."" (guitar riff) But you're old Uncle Sammy
 didn't stop there. Uncle Sammy!
 Uncle Sammy! (canned applause) (Adam)
 Yeah, Uncle Sammy hasn't been
 such a cool uncle. Because of anti-Asian racism
 during World War II, the United States interned
 Japanese Americans in concentration camps. Hey, it's our Japanese friend
 Kenji from up the street! Oh, that's not
 your friend. That's a spy who wants
 to kill Americans. (canned laughter) Uncle Sammy,
 why didn't you do that to German Americans
 in World War II? Yeah, I wonder. Because they're white. Because they're white. But all that changed
 when the US needed to suck up to its Asian allies
 during the Cold War. See, as the Soviet Union
 rose to power, the US worried
 that Soviet propaganda was making communism
 sound ""dyno-mite."" (Russian accent)
 America is so racist,
 am I right? It's like, hey, USA,
 cut it out! Woof.
 Guess I better ""have mercy""
 on these Asians. So America embarked
 on a propaganda campaign to tout Asian-American
 success stories. The State Department
 highlighted Asian-American artists,
 politicians, and even sent
 an all Chinese-American basketball team
 on tour overseas. Forget all that
 nastiness earlier. America loves
 our Asian sports heroes. And in 1965,
 Congress approved a landmark
 immigration law that ditched
 racist restrictions. But it gave preference
 to immigrants who had training,
 talent, or skill sets that would benefit
 the US economy. (speaker feedback) Sammy and The Rippers
 are changing their tune. Border's now open
 for smart, successful Asian immigrants. (guitar riff) Wow! Now that I've let
 all these educated, successful Asians
 into America, I've gotta say, Asian Americans sure are
 successful and educated. (wild guitar riff) (canned laughter) So America went from a country
 that despised Asians to one that held them up as a shining example
 of assimilation. And this self-fulfilling
 prophecy resulted in the ""model minority"" myth. And the most sinister part
 of this myth is it was used to put
 other minorities down. And it's still holding
 people back today. Oh, it's our very special
 guest star, professor of history
 at Indiana University Ellen Wu. (canned applause) Why did I need to use
 the ladder, Adam? Aren't we on
 the ground floor? It's a sitcom thing. In the 1960s,
 government officials looked at socio-economic data from African-American
 communities and contrasted it
 to the so-called ""family values and stability""
 of Asian Americans. Now, this fueled
 racist claims that black people had
 no one to blame but themselves if they experienced poverty and other social
 disadvantages. Conservatives went on
 to use these claims to justify making cuts
 to many essential social programs
 for African Americans and other disadvantaged
 minority groups. They were even used to argue
 against civil rights. Come on, you don't see
 Computer complaining about ""fair and equal
 protection."" Asians earned their place
 in this country. Why can't you?
 Wh-- what? No! Uncle Sammy,
 you helped Asian people. Why can't you see that? And the model minority myth
 hurts Asian people too. If an Asian-American student
 is struggling in school, many teachers assume that they
 don't really need extra help. And it's not true
 that all Asians are crazy rich
 and successful. The poverty rate
 for Asian Americans is actually higher than
 the national average. And frankly,
 it's kinda ridiculous that we lump people
 from so many different backgrounds together
 as ""Asian."" Yeah, Asian people
 are not a monolith. Trey, you and your
 multi-ethnic adopted parents keep referring to me as your
 ""smart Asian neighbor."" Specifically,
 I am Korean American and, sure, I'm smart, but I also love
 Ultimate Frisbee. Why doesn't anybody
 talk about that? (canned applause) You know what?
 This is messed up. Computer's a person who contains multitudes, and probably
 has a real name. You know what, Uncle Sammy? This is all your fault. Get out of my room. Whoa, watch the hair! (canned laughter
 and applause)

 Cape Canaveral, Florida. A spacecraft the size of a grand piano left
 Earth on top of a rocket traveling 36,000 miles
 per hour. This is New Horizons. It's a NASA probe and its mission is to complete humanity’s initial tour of our solar system by flying past Pluto
 and its moons. On board are seven scientific instruments,
 a generator fueled by decaying plutonium, and a few other things...
 It has a container filled with the ashes of Clyde Tombaugh. That’s the astronomer who discovered
 Pluto in 1930); Two American flags;
 Two state quarters: from Florida and Maryland; A CD-Rom containing the names of 400,000 people
 who signed up in 2005; A CD-Rom with pictures of of the New Horizons
 team; A piece of SpaceShipOne (the first privately
 owned spacecraft); And a US stamp from1991  
 that says “Pluto: Not Yet Explored.” New Horizons has been traveling through space
 for over 9 years now. And its date with Pluto has finally arrived. To understand how big this is, you have
 to get that Pluto is really far away. Really, really far away. Billions of miles
 away. So back in grade school we modeled the solar system like this. But actually this is a huge lie. OK so if the Earth is the size of a basketball, Pluto would be the size of a golf ball, and on that same scale, the distance between them... OK tell me when to stop Keep going…. keep going...now, go outside…. and
 get on a train. That golf ball would be over 50 miles away.
 Holy sh*t!! Yeah that’s at its closest distance from us. And at the same scale, New Horizons, NASA's robot would be a tiny fraction of
 the size of a grain of sand. And despite this immense distance, NASA’s engineers
 have successfully guided New Horizons toward its target
 and they’re retrieving data back over radio waves….very slowly The radio waves take 4.5 hours to come all the way from New Horizons to us. NASA has to use 200-foot-wide
 antennas just to even detect the signal, and typical download speed is 1 kilobit per
 second. How slow is that exactly? So if you had an image that’s 1024 pixels
 wide, it would take about 40 minutes just to download it. That’s 50 times slower than the dialup modems
 from the 90s. And one of the key pieces of data New Horizons
 will be retrieving is good photos of Pluto. Right now we don't have any good photos of Pluto. The best things we have, from the Hubble space telescope -- it still looks like a blurry blob. But New Horizons is going to return historic, high-definition photos of Pluto.
 It already got some great shots of Jupiter when it flew by in 2007 to use the giant planet’s
 gravity as a slingshot. So right now New Horizons is traveling at over 31,000 miles per hour — and it's pretty much used up all its fuel so it can't slow down as it approaches the target, so all the observations will happen quickly. And after that?
 After that, New Horizons is just going to keep going and in 2019, engineers will fly it past another small, icy body at the edge of the solar system to collect more data.
 And as for Pluto, it will continue on around the sun, taking 248 years to complete one revolution.
 That means that the entire history of the United States has unfolded in the time it's taken Pluto to orbit the Sun once.
 The last time Pluto was in its current position, we didn't understand how species
 evolved or how germs transmitted diseases. Wow.
 Aviation was still decades away — and spaceflight wouldn't happen for nearly 200 years.
 But this time around, when Pluto finishes an orbit,
 it's going to be met by a tiny robot sent by a curious species of apes living on a planet billions of miles away."
moonlanding,"Did we really land on the moon? Mr. Beat examines the main reasons why people think the moon landings were faked. And this is his first official collaboration with Keith Hughes!

Yes, we landed on the moon, but it’s been almost 45 years since we’ve been back there. Heck, it’s been almost 45 years since we went beyond low Earth orbit. 
 
And when I say “we,” I mean the United States. Only 12 humans have ever walked on the surface of the moon, all of them men, and all of them American. The last two to be there were Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt. That was in December of 1972, of the Apollo 17 mission.

It’s easy to understand why people would be skeptical. Skeptics often point to the motive for wanting to fake the whole thing. The race to the moon was part of the Space Race, during a particularly tense time during the Cold War. The United States and Soviet Union were battling it out to get there first. Skeptics say the United States would have wanted to fake it to show they won the Space Race even if they knew it actually wasn’t possible to go. The Soviet Union had epically failed to ever get even near the moon, so they argue it seems suspicious that the United States able to land men safely on the moon six times in 3 and a half years, yet never do so since. Was this just a publicity stunt, faked in order to strongly discourage the Soviet Union and give the United States a huge advantage in the Cold War while saving its lots of money? 
 
But how could this hoax be pulled off? Skeptics argue the technology did exist to recreate a fake mooning landing in a film studio. Sure, they argue the astronauts really did take off into space, but they likely just orbited the earth for several days before landing back on Earth, while faked footage was distributed to the masses.
But what evidence do that have of the moon landings being faked? For the rest of this video, I will first give you evidence that creates doubt, then give you NASA’s response, and then give you my conclusion.
 
The first thing that causes doubt is the footage showing the American flag on the moon waving. Skeptics say the flag waving shows the presence of wind, which should be impossible on the moon because it doesn’t have much of an atmosphere and is surrounded by a vacuum. NASA insists that the flag moved due to astronaut Buzz Aldrin twisting the flagpole, causing it to move like that. Apparently the astronauts also accidentally bent the horizontal rods that were supposed to hold the flag outward.
The next evidence that causes doubt is the fact that there were no stars in any of the footage or photographs taken by NASA on the moon. Skeptics say stars were left out because astronomers would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or Moon. NASA, as well as many many others, argue that of course you wouldn’t be able to see the stars because the moon’s surface is so bright. It’s the same reason why you can’t see the stars standing on a bright football field at night. Some astronauts were able to take long exposure UV photographs of bright stars and Venus from the moon, though. But skeptics would probably argue these photos were taken from earth.
What about the fact that there was no blast crater from the lunar module on the moon, especially when scientists before predicted one would be created? Well NASA says those scientists predicted wrong. The fact is, the pressure on the moon was simply too low for the lunar module to create a crater.
Quite a bit of discussion by skeptics revolve around the discussion of lighting and shadows in photographs taken on the moon. Shadows are inconsistent and often intersect in photographs. Skeptics argue that the shadows should be completely black and run parallel to each other. NASA and others argue that shadows are weird on the Moon due to many light sources and lunar dust. Also, the unique terrain of the moon alters how the shadows are seen.
Skeptics also say the photographs on the Moon show the same exact background, despite astronauts saying the photos were taken far away from each other. They argue that the backdrop was basically kept the same, even for different Apollo missions. Take this photograph, for example. Skeptics have combined the two pictures and claim the backgrounds match. Pretty crazy, eh? Well, NASA says that because the Moon is much smaller than Earth, horizons appear closer to the naked eye than they really are, and thus may look identical from different viewpoints.",Did We Really Land on the Moon?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_bVQitVmjU,-1,26428,393,86,386,U_bVQitVmjU,"No way That's great We landed on the moon! Yes, we landed on the moon, but it's been 45 years since we've been back there Heck, it’s been almost 45 years since we went beyond low Earth orbit. And when I say “we,” I mean the United States.

Keith has been making history videos on YouTube longer than just about anybody, and they are all high quality, so while you’re over there, be sure to subscribe. Now, the moon landings. Apparently, we never landed on the moon. It was just a hoax. At least that’s what a lot of people think. One survey conducted in the United Kingdom last year found 52% of people thought the moon landing was a hoax. Ok, so that’s just one survey, and probably not a good sample, but still A lot of people out there don't think the moon landings really happened. It’s easy to understand why people would be skeptical. Skeptics often point to the motive for wanting to fake the whole thing.

The Soviet Union had epically failed to ever get even near the moon, so they argue it seems suspicious that the United States able to land men safely on the moon six times in 3 and a half years, yet never do so since. Was this just a publicity stunt, faked in order to strongly discourage the Soviet Union and give the United States a huge advantage in the Cold War while saving its lots of money? But how could this hoax be pulled off? Skeptics argue the technology did exist to recreate a fake mooning landing in a film studio. Sure, they argue the astronauts really did take off into space, but they likely just orbited the earth for several days before landing back on Earth, while faked footage was distributed to the masses. But what evidence do that have of the moon landings being faked? For the rest of this video, I will first give you evidence that creates doubt, then give you NASA’s response, and then give you my conclusion. The first thing that causes doubt is the footage showing the American flag on the moon waving. Skeptics say the flag waving shows the presence of wind, which should be impossible on the moon because it doesn’t have much of an atmosphere and is surrounded by a vacuum. NASA insists that the flag moved due to astronaut Buzz Aldrin twisting the flagpole, causing it to move like that. Apparently the astronauts also accidentally bent the horizontal rods that were supposed to hold the flag outward. My take: I give NASA the benefit of the doubt here The next evidence that causes doubt is the fact that there were no stars in any of the footage or photographs taken by NASA on the moon. Skeptics say stars were left out because astronomers would have been able to use them to determine whether the photos were taken from the Earth or Moon. NASA, as well as many many others, argue that of course you wouldn’t be able to see the stars because the moon’s surface is so bright. It’s the same reason why you can’t see the stars standing on a bright football field at night. Some astronauts were able to take long exposure UV photographs of bright stars and Venus from the moon, though. But skeptics would probably argue these photos were taken from earth. My take: I’m again going to go with NASA on this one What about the fact that there was no blast crater from the lunar module on the moon, especially when scientists before predicted one would be created? Well NASA says those scientists predicted wrong. The fact is, the pressure on the moon was simply too low for the lunar module to create a crater. Again, NASA for the win on this one Quite a bit of discussion by skeptics revolve around the discussion of lighting and shadows in photographs taken on the moon. Shadows are inconsistent and often intersect in photographs. Skeptics argue that the shadows should be completely black and run parallel to each other. NASA and others argue that shadows are weird on the Moon due to many light sources and lunar dust. Also, the unique terrain of the moon alters how the shadows are seen. I can definitely understand the skepticism on this one, but again give NASA the benefit of the doubt. Skeptics also say the photographs on the Moon show the same exact background, despite astronauts saying the photos were taken far away from each other. They argue that the backdrop was basically kept the same, even for different Apollo missions. Take these photographs, for example. Skeptics have combined the two pictures and claim the backgrounds match...kind of. Well, NASA says that because the Moon is much smaller than Earth, horizons appear closer to the naked eye than they really are, and thus may look identical from different viewpoints. I don’t know. This one is definitely suspicious.  I'm a little bit skeptical on this one. Other skeptics point to the massive radiation found in the Van Allen radiation belt and just the radiation in general out in space. They argue that the inevitably prolonged radiation exposure would have made it impossible for astronauts to go to the moon. NASA says the astronauts in the Apollo spacecrafts were only in Van Allen radiation belt for a little over an hour and a half at most, and that their spacecraft had aluminum protection from the radiation. Ok, so say they really did go to the moon but the film was destroyed by all the radiation so they had to re-film it on a Hollywood set? Well NASA says the film was kept in metal containers that protected it from radiation as well. Well what about solar flares on the surface of the moon? NASA admits that could be a potential threat since the moon has no atmosphere, but no solar flares were recorded during any of the Apollo missions, luckily. These concerns have merit, and I could honestly see them landing on the moon and having all their film destroyed and having to film back on earth as a backup plan. I don't know. That kind of makes sense to me, actually. Now wait just a second.
 SUPPOSEDLY There is still stuff on the moon that the astronauts would have left behind. If we can just show those, we can put this debate to rest. Well skeptics argue that if we have instruments like the Hubble Space Telescope, which can see way way way off into the universe, why can’t we use it to see various objects still on the moon? Eh? NASA doesn’t want to do this, so skeptics are like, “see, if you got nothing to hide, you would.” NASA argues that no telescope in existence can show these objects in detail. The smallest thing you can currently see on the moon from our most powerful telescope would have to be bigger than a house. NASA says, why would we waste our time when nothing would show up anyway? Still, in 2009, NASA sent its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, a robotic spacecraft that has been orbiting and mapping nearly all of the moon’s surface. It released these photos, saying, see there’s all the stuff left by the Apollo missions, but these haven’t convinced skeptics much because you can’t make out many details with these. Plus, NASA released them, and they could have Photoshopped them, man! Other countries have also confirmed the Moon landings with photographs of their own, although China never released theirs. My take: there is plenty of third-party evidence to verify we landed on the moon. It would have to be quite the conspiracy- involving people from all over the world, to pull this off. While it is unfortunate the photographs we have aren’t not that detailed and in the Photoshop era maybe it wouldn’t matter if they were detailed. People wouldn't believe it anyway. I still lean towards NASA on this one. Skeptics point out how the footprints in the moondust are suspiciously well preserved, despite no moisture on the moon. NASA argued that Moon dust is not weathered, so it would stick together like that. This theory ended up being debunked on an episode of the show Mythbusters. By the way, that episode also debunked claims that the photos and film were faked and debunked claims that the American flag on the moon couldn’t move like that. There are other pieces of evidence that skeptics point to, but I am not bringing those up due to the fact that they are just not that convincing. The fact of the matter is, we will know FOR SURE if we landed on the moon or not, as billionaires like Elon Musk and his forward thinking company SpaceX are looking to get there within a few years. NASA is also looking to get annual flights to the moon’s orbit by 2023. So In my opinion, yes, WE LANDED ON THE MOON! There’s just too much third party evidence for the moon landings. But I totally understand why people are skeptical. The motives are there. Regardless, hopefully in the near future we will get definitive proof that we landed on the moon. But people probably still won't believe."

Jump,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4jTO6kg9Lw,0,1300021,10607,378,2156,X4jTO6kg9Lw,Steve curb is no fun and I told him this directly last night after Steph Curry said Oracle Arena on fire hitting 11 11 three-pointers on the way to 51 points Steve Kerr is no fun because step did all this in just three quarters and then curse at him for the fourth and sure Master if Stephan sprained an ankle or something playing garbage minutes but that's about logic and prudence and all that crazy stuff won't come on didn't we all wanna see Steph go for 60 I mean actually if you take what he did in the first three quarters and multiply it out to what it would have happened if he had played the fourth step was on pace to score 68 which is insane but also honestly we sort of should have seen this coming in warm-ups because when he did this man come on down and in totally normal um once the game started for real stuff was no less ridiculous he shot 73 percent from the floor in the first quarter including a two-minute 24-second stretch when he scored 16 points we tell you Brit you are speaking for the whole NBA here there really isn't anything you can do and steps range was as ever ridiculous he is knocking these down from 30 nearly 40 feet out and even Kerr who knows it's in the coaches handbook to chastise a player for shooting from such low percentage spots well he said this and I wasn't even mad that he took them so you know you get a guy taking 40 footers and you're on the sidelines going yeah that's it's a good shot good job I explained that I we haven't we've never seen this before by the third quarter things got even more outrageous here's staff trying to pull off an alley-oop to KD which doesn't quite work so I don't know he just turns it into a four-point play as he falls out of Bounce come on but the time he hits his tenth three-pointer of the night it's got a little bit of a Jordan shrug going there huh nice by the time he hits his eleventh look it's not like he's not even guarded for these defense he's just operating inside of it yeah well there's a little bit of a flood there just a little bit let's talk about Curry hitting 11 threes up shall we in NBA history do you know who is hit 11 threes in one game Steph back in 2013 Steph in 2016 Steph again step again Steph last year Steph last night and then seven other guys who've each totally done it once what about threes overall Steph has now sunk 33 of them in five games which is a lot especially when you consider there are four entire teams that haven't yet hit that mark come on man so what brought all of this on I don't know did Steph want to just get some revenge against the Wizards for Markieff Morris trying to pull his brother Seth shorts down the other day is the increased pace to play this season is that it or is officiating that newly is emphasizing this freedom of movement has that created those laboratory level perfect conditions for Steph to go all Wilt Chamberlain no he's done or maybe it's the Steph well knows how to read an even for a guy who doesn't let his ego run his life it has not escaped his attention that just three years after winning his second straight MVP he wasn't even really in the MVP conversation at the start of this season Kevin Durant spoke about this after the game I mean obviously there it is a play of do part I think the MVP nowadays is the up-and-coming star to be able Ward I think in but you know it's got to take somebody to do something like this tonight some kind of breakthrough would change that narrative it you know players have been in the lead for a while that won a couple of MVPs you know short of voters tend to overlook them not you know maliciously but it's just the fact that they looking for the next player but you know you got to wake them up with games like that stuff definitely did that tonight um guys are we about to witness Curry's forgot about Dre season if so I'm totally here for that it would be epic now we just got to get Steve Kerr on board so I want to know what you guys think do you listen to KD there right he's saying MVP MVP a lot of people feel Kevin Durant is some way the obstacle and stuff winning the MVP cuz they're both on the same team what do y'all think people got to kill that you know Katie or Steph can't win the MVP because Katie's come to this team and they really just destroyed these guys of you know being worthy of that last time I checked this guy has won 2 MVPs without Katie on the team he has won 73 games you know in a single season without Katie so Katie yeah he adds more to the team but when you are doing this right here averaging 34 points and just putting up hysterical numbers like come on how can you not be included in another MVP candidate on your team it does take a little bit away but when you have extraordinary performances like this it's just there's no way you can leave him out of the conversation because think about the criteria that we put on MVP every year the best was on the best team record wise and the best player we're gonna see that this year go to state he's playing the best right now right now he's playing the best but you know they they swap each and every day Katie ago 4:35 you've kind of hit from some of the argument against and I'm not making it I'm just giving you the counter is that first of all none of these especially ones boogie comes back you're gonna have five all-star starters no one's ever doubled ever right which is not certainly not with anthony davis or some other guys kind of appalled just said that one night--it m18 it's him you don't consistently get to like one guy and the same all the great teams if you got two or three all-stars in this case they got four all-stars how hard is it to average 30 some points so many great players they all need the ball but you're still standing out points because when Kevin and Ray Cain said the team out I'll drop from 25 to like 18 right team but we're still a great team he's doing this and he's still rated he's scoring they're still a great team that's a difficult thing to do with with so many people need in touch and to you guys at point Kevin Durant went 5 for 5 perfect in the first quarter the story was still safe and I mean Katie had 30 in this they were shooting over 50% the first quarter I think they had like semi first half at 71 first half points it didn't matter it was like these are the Warriors and like the third quarter especially they're breaking like you know that Bible quote that makes the internet they're breaking the NBA and stuff in the words they're it's this ridiculous the watch
moonlanding,"Jalen Rose explains that Dennis Rodman's claim on First Take that Michael Jordan would average 50 points in the current era of the NBA is not too far off because MJ would make more free throws since the league is less physical today.

Up,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkQBap70RQc,0,879966,8263,510,5495,dkQBap70RQc,Bowles of the late 90s will always of course be remembered as one of the NBA's most iconic dynasties but how would they fare if they played the Warriors of this day and age Dennis Rodman was on that team he offered this take it Scottie Pippen got anybody six foot nine good God anybody late the link it's Kevin Durant you have a hard time with Scottie Pippen and I know who were guarding Michael Jordan on the Warriors literally who I got no problem that's got green guy dream on keeping your teeth straight honey listen your mama okay you know this is dr. dr.oz called it right now baby you're a description come ask me huh so I I don't have a better response than that we can have a conversation about the goals of the 90s versus the Warriors of today those are always fun conversations they lead nowhere but they fill up time but how about him taking shots like that at the current day yes so anytime you comparing greatness you're gonna have people on both sides feeling like you're sliding one and rightfully so and in this case it seems like I'm gonna do that to the go and stay warriors how many championships have they won well in this particular stretch three okay Bulls won three championships in a row right twice correct okay so that's the answer to the question done well Michael Jordan never made it to the finals and lost correct right yeah and so I would think if you go and Bob matchups and people always try to do this it's not necessarily who starts the game it's who finishes the game mm-hmm so let's not put Bogut in this that's not put luc longley in this there's somebody to play it against those late 90s Bulls team yeah their lineup was Dennis Rodman who's won multiple rebounding titles yeah and Defensive Player of the Year there's nobody on the gold state words that is one a rebounding title okay fair you got Mike and Scottie defensive player of the years all-nba defense same with Dennis Rodman so Toni Kukoc was a stretch for so again both great teams but the answer is to blow yeah look I happen to think the Bulls would win in a very hard-fought series but I also think it is worth pointing out that and I covered those teams I was around that there is no one we were talking earlier this morning about courting attention absolutely no one in history who has sought out attention the way Dennis Rodman sought that seeks out attention so the notion that he's calling out you know the the draymond greens of the world does not surprise me one day here's what's hard about that comparison and I hear guys talk about this all the time and Jay who I respect who played in the league during the time when you play with hand checking when you played with guys clotheslining you going to the basket but here's the thing Jay and that's what I ask people when I'm having these basketball conversations and this one thing that I know to be true about basketball since the beginning at a time shooting is the great equalizer and when you look at go this state and when you think about the way they play right this new because when they were playing we were talking about this oh this is the new way to play basketball by the way Michael Jordan is the goal I don't even miss yeah he's the go well Rodman got his way to that let me focus in through the conversation okay Rodman did work his way to what you just said about Jordan and what you just said about the era in which they played and said this if when I could play in this era yeah I was 50 they have is 50 points liver oil is a great time no doubt if I wanted Tubb three players ever played with Kobe Magic a Kareem but to microsite them I don't know why you guys discussed a goat why are you different he's saying if Michael Jordan played today let he said 50 let me ask you how many points a game with Michael Jordan average if he played in this league this style the way they play now 10 more than his highest year so I think as high as years like 35 36 he's averaged 37 one year hambo will get us that I think he averaged more than that based on what you just said the game isn't as physical okay and he's not that far from right he'd be close to 50 that I think he got 37 right here 10 more points based on free throws and the ability to to not only be dominant mid-range but also he'd be a knock down three shooters so 47 MJ would get 50 and he would be one of those guys in this era that would be competing on that level but but look there is a there is always an underlying thing about when we have this conversation when we talk about Michael Jordan Michael Jordan is a great player in any NBA era yeah that's what we don't give to these guys today I don't give a damn who you are you ain't stopping 60 Levin Kevin Durant from getting his shot I don't care if you Scottie Pittman I don't care if you we saw Dirk Nowitzki score point after point after point and then have a athletic bone in his body cuz he was seven foot Kevin de rigueur score on anybody LeBron James could play in any era in the NBA so I get it like don't have to go discussing all of that but Michael Jordan would do what a lot of these guys are doing now I think we just convolute the errors I would take the Bulls in seven and I would sure love to see it we're so glad you're watching ESPN on

I am finally going home today,  And in the first few days, in preparation for returning home,  You rehearsed all the procedures and wireless instructions,  But only when you put on the spacesuit and close the hatch  You just know  After four hours, you will return to Earth  The astronaut and the spacecraft are ready to separate  The Russian part of the space station has different connection points,  Can dock Soyuz spacecraft  In this example,  The spacecraft is separated from the so-called service compartment  In this case, the separated Soyuz spacecraft arrives in orbit below the space station  Orbital movement sometimes accelerates  Sometimes the Soyuz has been connected to the dock docking module under the space station  In this case,  The space station needs to change its position about 40 minutes before separation  The Soyuz separates, enters a higher orbit and increases speed  In both cases, after completing one round of the earth, the two orbits intersect  But because they are currently at different operating speeds  The Soyuz arrives at the meeting point at different times  This hinders the docking of the spacecraft with the space station  When the flight commander prepares to issue the `separate` command  The astronauts in the cabin were prompted for the separation operation  The commander in the cabin gave  Command to open the air lock  This is a mechanical device connected to the aircraft  About 3-4 minutes, the air lock is fully opened  Soyuz no longer attached to the space station  When docking, the activation nozzles that remain in the space station due to mechanical compression make the Soyuz  At a speed of 12 to 15 centimeters per second  Leaving the space station  The propulsion system on the Soyuz was shut down due to being too close to the space station  So as to avoid the residual chemical dust when pushing  Pollution to the space station  The image transmitted by the astronaut through the camera outside the cabin  And indications on the display  Confirmed by the separation of the space station  European Space Agency astronaut Paul Nespoli  It was the 27th expedition team that returned to Earth on the Soyuz.  When we separated from the space station, I didn’t realize it at all  No feeling physically  The ejection from the space station is due to the spring in the cabin  The elastic finish  You don’t need to start the engine connected to the space station,  Because it will eject pollutants  So you just drift away, all you have to do is  Surveillance by external camera  To guarantee the Soyuz  Enter the descending channel  I don't have any other feelings  I just feel that I started to return to Earth after a long journey  3 minutes later, when the spacecraft  After moving about 20 meters, the controller in the cabin  Ignite for 15 seconds and increase the descent speed to 2 kilometers per second  In this way, the Soyuz was directed to a relatively safe location from the space station  After the detachment, the ground controller  Upload the required data through the computer in the cabin  To make the descent process complete automatically  Astronauts continue to communicate with the ground  They have to check the correctness of the data before using the computer  In this step, astronauts must be very careful  Prepare for the next key operation  This is-into orbit ignition  As you can see, although the Soyuz is now  Far away from the space station, it is still at the same height as the International Space Station  Orbit the earth  The purpose of entering the orbit and firing is to force the Soyuz to reduce the speed of its operation  As a result, the orbit of the aircraft is changed to return to the atmosphere  The natural resistance generated by the atmosphere caused the Soyuz to slowly descend,  Until the parachute opens  To ensure a soft landing in the return cabin  This kind of brake is used at the stern of the spacecraft  The main engine produces a direction opposite to the running direction  Thrust to achieve  Direction of operation and thrust of deceleration  Must be accurately calculated and completed  Because they will directly affect  Angle of return path  If the ignition is insufficient  Will cause the spacecraft to still be too fast and enter the atmosphere in a high orbit,  It is possible to cross the atmosphere and fly in space  This is certainly not a successful return  In addition, too much ignition makes the angle of entry of the spacecraft too steep  That way, reaching the bottom of the atmosphere too fast  And make the temperature outside the cabin reach 2000 degrees Celsius  There is a risk of burning at such a temperature  Therefore, a very critical part of correct ignition  So that we can sail at a speed of 120 meters per second  In order to achieve accurate ignition, the main engine is ignited  Exactly 4 minutes and 45 seconds  Soyuz is now orbiting  Enter the atmosphere safely  Landing starts in about 55 minutes  During this period, the spacecraft sailed along the track for about 30 minutes.  And then at an altitude of 140 kilometers  Separated into three parts: orbital module, return module  And equipment compartment  The cabins will not collide with each other  This is called collision-free separation  Only the return capsule can guarantee the safe return of the astronauts to Earth  The other two cabins will disintegrate and be burned by the atmosphere  The sub-cabin of the spacecraft is completed in a few seconds  Because every cabin is  Separable part  All this process is completed by the blasting bolt and blasting accessories  Feel in the cabin  Like being taken from outside the cabin  Hammering everywhere up and down is the same  Accompanied by the sound of ping-pong-pong  The spacecraft vibrates for a few milliseconds  This feeling is very interesting  During the return cabin, the temperature in the return cabin is extremely high  To protect the astronauts  There are special insulation tiles on the outside of the vehicle  Keep out the heat  As the atmosphere thickens, the return capsule changes its exterior  So that the protective layer faces the downward direction  Return capsule into the atmosphere  This is the most stressful part of the journey home  At this time, we believe that we really re-enter the atmosphere  I really look out the window  Really see us rolling, I'm a little confused  I thought we would return from a special angle  I started to look at the operating instructions, we continued to look out after doing a few operations  I see that we have entered the plasma layer  It's red outside, the window becomes very dark  What happened is  The plasma stream is burning  Protective layer outside the cabin  Interestingly, at this time, I don’t feel too much  I just started to feel the gravity of the earth's center  But this kind of gravity is very weak at first  You can use it to slide towards the seat and be supported  You have to wear a seat belt so that you can sit on the seat  Real and wonderful feeling  The return capsule landed along the aisle  It’s like surfing on a huge wave  Soyuz can make fine adjustments to keep track of whereabouts  How does the return capsule control the trajectory of falling?  Although the Soyuz return capsule has no wings  But you can also change the flight route through the air  The Soyuz design allows it to do this  When the elevator of the return cabin rotates in one direction, the return cabin can be raised  It will fall when reversed  In this way, the return capsule can maintain a predetermined orbit  Another effect is that this rotation can  Move the return compartment sideways  This effect is very useful because it can  Flexible choice of landing location  This maneuvering side shift has  Was used to consider choosing the ideal track  During the landing in the atmosphere, due to the deceleration, the astronauts  Feel one's own weight  Several times more than the weight on the ground  When the return capsule descends to an altitude of 35 kilometers,  That is, 6-7 minutes after entering the atmosphere,  Reach the maximum gravity load-4 times the gravity  Gravity is very strong  People on the earth don’t understand such a strong gravitational force  How does it work in our human body and its surroundings  But if you return from space, you will feel its effect  Because you have adapted to the weightless environment of long-distance travel  But now you feel the gravity  Look at the information in your hand, you feel your hand is heavy  Do you think the watch you are wearing has a heavy meal  Your book, the objects around you, your head is very heavy  This is indeed a very strong feeling  If the automatic control system fails unexpectedly,  Astronauts can use alternate manual control  They are fully prepared and rigorously trained for this situation  Another option is to drop the ballistic  The spacecraft began to spin and flew along a fairly steep trajectory  Without any additional side shift  The weight load will rise to 9 in this case  When the return capsule reaches a height of 10.5 kilometers,  Its speed has dropped from 28,000 km/h to 800 km/h  In order to further reduce the speed,  The parachute bag is ejected and a group of parachutes are opened  You can really start when you enter the end of the atmosphere  Hearing the wind, you finally broke through the sound barrier  Then, of course you are back  Usual flight area  At about 30,000 feet, the parachute opens  This is a very critical moment,  The only thing the astronauts on the Soyuz have to do is not to do it manually  This is totally an automatic system  So far, everything is working fine, of course we also have a spare umbrella  The backup umbrella only works when the main umbrella cannot be opened  But then it happened in an extremely urgent situation  As you can imagine, this 2-ton return cabin  Is passing through the atmosphere at the speed of sound,  Then the parachute suddenly opened on the side,  Like dragging you with a small rope  It's being pulled around like a yo-yo  This is even more dangerous than such an action on a roller coaster  This is frightening for us  But it might be fun for others  Because they will say: great! This is the most fun time  However, after a few minutes, at an altitude of 8.5 kilometers  The main umbrella of the 1000 square meter canopy is opened  The return capsule slowly descended at a speed of 22 kilometers per hour  The return cabin was suspended under an umbrella  Face the ground at a certain angle  This angle can disperse the return cabin  Heat accumulated on the surface during the return process  But everything will calm down, as long as you successfully open the umbrella, you will descend in the windless air,  The key to returning,  After the umbrella opening process is complete  You will safely and slowly  Landed on the ground  Actually you realize for the first time  Yes, I am safe, we succeeded!  At 5.5 kilometers above  The front heat shield and the glass outside the outer window fall off  The return cabin releases the remaining fuel and oxygen from the oxygen cylinder  To reduce the risk of explosion when the return capsule hits the ground  In order to properly position the reentry module for landing  The main parachute is converted into a vertical descent state  This adjustment can keep the astronauts in a safe position,  To reduce the impact of landing  Brake rocket hidden behind the heat shield  Ready to fire  In the return capsule, the astronaut’s seat will automatically lift  In order to achieve the effect of shock absorption  Usually, search and rescue personnel will fly by plane or helicopter  Tracking the return cabin  When the first umbrella is opened, the helicopter is already in  Landing nearby before landing  The team members help the astronauts out of the cabin  Finally, at 70cm from the ground, 6 brake rockets ignite  To reduce the speed of the return capsule to 5 km/h  The return capsule hits the ground, but the astronaut’s seat will still move down,  The shock absorber will cushion the impact of landing on the astronaut  Soft landing is not actually soft  You have to prepare for landing, protect your body with your hands,  Do not touch metal objects, hold the manual in your hand to protect your body,  Don’t stick your tongue between your teeth  Lie down on the seat as much as possible  You just wait for this ""soft landing"" to happen  To me, it’s like a frontal collision between a truck and a car,  Of course, I was in the car  With a touch,  Everything including me is shaking,  Everything is over, everything is still  Then, I saw the bird outside the window, I looked at my colleagues and said:  Friends, welcome back to the earth!  The first thing the commander did after landing was  Disconnect the connection between the return cabin and the umbrella  One of two ropes  This is important in windy conditions, it prevents  The wind-blown umbrella lifts the return cabin off the ground  You know, you are on the ground, you hear the voice of the search and rescue team  The next step is, you know that in 5 minutes, they will open the hatch  You can breathe fresh air  The astronauts have returned safely now  There must be a recovery process after this extraordinary trip  Soon they will be reunited with their families"

 #8. “Hidden Critters”-This curious aspect of the one-dollar bill isn’t as easy to debunk as some of theories revolving around US currency. If you look extremely closely, and we mean magnifying glass close, outside of the top left part of the ornate border that surrounds the number one on the right side of the bill you will see an odd looking figure. Some say that the image is of a skull and some say it is a spider but the most common thing that people think it is, is an owl. What is the significance of this hidden critter? Well as it turns out the owl is considered to be one of the main symbols of the Freemasons, the secret and powerful brotherhood that many of the founding fathers are believed to have belonged. The Freemasons believe that the owl represents reincarnation because they are nocturnal and according to legends, owls contain the souls of people who have passed away who are waiting until morning to find a new body. Though less fantastical, they have also long been symbols of wisdom, the pursuit of which is a common theme in Freemasonry and the Illuminati.

#7 “Money Makings”- One secret that you probably weren’t aware of lies in what material the dollar bill is actually made out of. You may have wondered how something made out of paper can withstand so much wear and tear over the years and not disintegrate like normal paper would. Well, this is because U.S. paper currency isn’t made out of paper at all, rather a combination of  seventy-five percent cotton and twenty-five percent linen, which give it superior durability to plain old paper. These bills are also required to have red and blue fibers woven into the tight fabric for added security. The average dollar bill lasts around six years, whereas if it was made of paper it probably wouldn’t last more than a year under the conditions our money experiences.

#6. “Letter Code”- Unless you are completely oblivious to what you are putting in your wallet you have probably noticed the circular stamp-looking marking with a letter inside of it on the dollar bill. This is is the Federal Reserve Seal and the letter inside of it represents the reserve bank that ordered the bill. The number next to the seal, called the Federal Reserve District Number also corresponds to this bank. There are twelve of these banks across the country and each of them represents a different region of the country. If you see the letter ‘A’ and the number ‘1’ this means the bill was ordered by the bank in Boston. If you see the letter ‘L’ and the number ‘12’ the bill was ordered by the bank in San Francisco.",10 MIND BLOWING Secrets In US Dollars!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DSjpCk4pKI,0,1410159,11255,1245,1300,9DSjpCk4pKI,"From hidden symbols and animals to the true
 meaning of the 'Eye of Providence'. Today we look at 10 Mind-Blowing Secrets in
 US Dollars! Number 10. ""Loaded With Latin""
 Everything sounds much more regal and official when it is put into Latin. When the founding fathers were orchestrating
 the beginnings of the United States they not only knew this, but they also wanted to set
 a high standard as they were attempting to be the first true republic in hundreds of
 years. One of the ways to do this and to also pay
 tribute to the Roman and Greek Republics of the past was by incorporating latin phrases
 into our currency. Needless to say, they went all out with this
 concept in the dollar bill, as if you take a quick glance at it you will see several
 American mottos in latin. Around what has become a highly recognizable
 symbol to Americans, the Eye and Pyramid (known as the Eye of Providence) there are two such
 phrases. Above it is the phrase 'Annuit Coeptis' which
 translates to 'He approves of our undertakings' which sounds quite nefarious at first, especially
 if you are believer in the Freemason and Illuminati conspiracies, but they are probably just talking
 about God. Underneath the pyramid is the phrase 'Novus
 Ordo Seclorum' which translates to 'a new order of the ages' which is believed to be
 referring to the establishment of a new type of government, though one could see how conspiracy
 theorists believe this points to the ""New World Order"". In the banner that is in the beak of the Eagle
 on the back, you may recognize the latin phrase 'E. Pluribus Unum', which means 'one from
 many' and is talking about the thirteen colonies coming together to form one nation. The last bit of latin on the dollar bill isn't
 a phrase but a date. It is kind of hard to spot at first but if
 you look closely at the base of the pyramid you will see the Roman Numerals MDCCLXXVI
 which in English numerals is the year 1776, the year the Declaration of Independence was
 signed. Number 9. ""Something's Missing""
 There have been a lot conspiracy theories and mysteries involving other bills than just
 the one the dollar bill and one of them involves five dollar bill. Theorists have been quick to point out that
 in the picture of the Lincoln Memorial on the back of the bill only 26 states are listed
 whereas there should be 48 as this is how many states there were when the monument was
 constructed. People have been quick to jump to the conclusion
 that the number 26 or the names of the states listed must mean something bigger in the grand
 scheme of things. But the truth is on the actually memorial
 in Washington D.C. the other states are listed on the sides. So that's why they can't be seen on the five. Number 8. ""Hidden Critters""
 This curious aspect of the one-dollar bill isn't as easy to debunk as some of conspiracy
 theories revolving around US currency. If you look extremely closely, and we mean
 magnifying glass close, outside of the top left part of the ornate border that surrounds
 the number one on the right side of the bill you will see an odd looking figure. Some say that the image is of a skull and

 One secret that you probably weren't aware of lies in what material the dollar bill is

 Unless you are completely oblivious to what you are putting in your wallet you have probably
 noticed the circular stamp-looking marking with a letter inside of it on the dollar bill. This is is the Federal Reserve Seal and the
 letter inside of it represents the reserve bank that ordered the bill. The number next to the seal, called the Federal
 Reserve District Number also corresponds to this bank. There are twelve of these banks across the
 country and each of them represents a different region of the country. If you see the letter 'A' and the number '1'
 this means the bill was ordered by the bank in Boston. If you see the letter 'L' and the number '12'
 the bill was ordered by the bank in San Francisco. Number 5. ""Lucky 13""
 Beyond just the Federal Reserve Seal and District Number the dollar bill is chock full of numbers
 and letters making it the focal point of many conspiracy theories from numerologists. One aspect of the bill that can be agreed
 on by these numerologists and historians is the fact that the founding fathers were obsessed
 with the number '13'. Though there are theories that say otherwise
 there is a fairly obvious reason for the fascination--there were thirteen original colonies. When studying a dollar bill you can start
 to see that not only did the designer of the bill want the thirteen colonies represented
 in our currency they wanted to hit people over the head with the number. In the great seal the number thirteen is referenced
 in seven different ways. On the shield in front of the eagle there
 are thirteen horizontal and thirteen vertical stripes. In the eagle's talons it is clutching an olive
 branch with thirteen berries and thirteen arrows. Above the eagle's head are thirteen stars
 and the pyramid in the Eye of Providence has thirteen steps. Many numerologists and conspiracy theorists
 will tell you that you are silly for thinking only of the thirteen colonies when looking
 at this repetition, as the number thirteen has long had satanic connotations. Number 4. ""No Forge Fiber""
 You have probably noticed the vibrant blue security strips on the new 100 dollar bill
 but did you know that all dollar bills except singles have a hidden security thread like
 this? It is one of the biggest secrets that is keeping
 counterfeiters at bay and the technology for them is constantly improving. These threads, that can only be seen using
 ultraviolet light are embedded in the fibers of the bills and placed at different locations
 depending on the bills denomination. Each bill also has its own special color. The thread on a five dollar bill is blue,
 it's orange on a ten, green on a twenty, yellow on a fifty and in addition to the visible
 blue one on a hundred dollar bill there is a hidden one to the left of Benjamin Franklin's
 face that is purple. Speaking of the blue 3D strip that is on the
 old C-Note, the treasury may start putting these strips on all denominations in the future
 as it has proven so incredibly difficult to replicate by counterfeiters. One of the main reasons why the thread is
 so effective is that it is holographic, if you bend the bill back and forth you will
 see the tiny '100s' labeled on the thread, turn into the liberty bell. Number 3. ""Eye of Providence""
 One of the most conspiracy provoking elements of the dollar bill is that of the Eye of Providence. Not only is it considered a blatant acknowledgement
 that the treasury and our country is run by the freemasonry, but also apparently it has
 satanic imagery in it as well. We will start off with the historical reasoning
 behind the symbol. This image also known as the 'eye of god'
 or the 'all-seeing eye' and has been using in several forms by Christians for hundreds
 of years, well before the founding of the United States. The triangle border around the eye is meant
 to represent the holy trinity. You can see uses of this eye in churches,
 cathedrals and government buildings dating back to the Holy Roman Empire. The symbol has been mainly used to signify
 that whatever the eye is emblazoned on has the blessing of god. Now, it is true that the symbol has been used
 by the Freemasons since 1797, but the problem is the use of the Eye of Providence on The
 Great Seal predates this by five years. Still, conspiracy theorists suggest that the
 link is no coincidence. There are also several theories that suggest
 that when draw lines from the 'a' to the 's' in 'annuit coeptis' to the letter 'o' in 'novus
 ordo seclorum' and then back to form a triangle and then highlight the outline of the pyramid
 that a pentagram is made aka Satan's favorite shape. Not only that, but when you add the letters
 that the bottom corners of the pyramid are touching--'n' and 'm'-- to 'a','o' and 's'
 it spells out MASON. Number 2. ""Security Stars""
 You have probably seen this next extremely important secret but not realized it. What is known as the EURion Constellation,
 is a set of five small rings that are placed next to each other and look similar to that
 of Orion's Belt. This marker is not only on all US paper currency
 but in a vast majority of the banknotes throughout the world. This constellation is used as an indicator
 that the bill is in fact real currency, for several types of machines. It's main function is to recognize the banknote
 and stop the machine from copying it. The pattern has mysterious origins as no one
 outside of those who were producing currency were aware of its existence until 2002 when
 a security researcher was trying to figure out why his color copier wouldn't copy a banknote
 for 10 Euros. All the signs point to it first being implemented
 in the late 1990s as a Japanese company released a patent for the design and correlating detection
 algorithm in 1995. If you have a twenty dollar bill on hand you
 can find several EURion constellations hiding in the miniature '20s' on the back left side. Number 1.""Super Eagle""
 The proud American Bald Eagle of The Great Seal is one of the most analyzed and dissected
 parts of the one dollar bill. Though some of the theories surrounding the
 imagery in the depiction of this majestic bird are radical, some of the hidden meanings
 are intentional. We'll start with the history. You may have wondered why the shield in front
 of the Eagle seems to be floating in mid-air, well this was designed to represent the idea
 that the U.S. citizens should be self-sufficient. On the shield, the lines going up-and-down
 are meant to stand for the states, while the bars going side-to-side are for the federal
 government which binds the states together. In the Eagle's clutches are a branch of olives
 on one side and arrows on the other, these symbolize the balance of war and peace. Initially the arrows were in the Eagle's left
 talon, the side that the Eagle was facing, but the press and politicians over in Europe
 were fearful that this showed the U.S.'s true intentions. So, instead of arguing with them, they switched
 the sides the olive branch and arrows were on. When you focus in on the smaller details you
 can see where the hard facts end and the theories start. For instance, there are those who claim that
 the number of feathers on the Eagle's right wing, 32, are put there to symbolize the number
 of degrees or levels that one can achieve as a Scottish Rite Freemason. There are also theories that suggest the nine
 tail feathers on the Eagle represent the 9 spheres of heaven which is part of Illuminati
 lore."
moonlanding,"How did the Hubble Space Telescope revolutionise astronomy and surpass all expectations?
 
DCODE how it has guaranteed new discoveries about the universe, in this fascinating 2016 series - Space’s Deepest Secrets.",The Extraordinary Hubble Space Telescope,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nNiULl5_2k,0,354803,5101,149,691,-nNiULl5_2k,"March 4th, 2016, NASA releases a historic
 image, one that many believed was impossible. This red dot is an entire galaxy whose light
 took 13.4 billion years to reach us. It is a photograph of our universe in its
 infancy, a mere three percent of its current age. All of a sudden now, you have a ringside seat
 to watch the entire universe evolve and change in front of you. All of that is down to the Hubble space telescope. What could this mysterious red galaxy reveal
 about the origins of the cosmos? That story begins when the Hubble telescope
 is still on the drawing board. Hubble was meant to solve a problem, cause
 people were trying to use ground-based telescopes to measure how fast the expansion of the universe
 was. And that means a factor of uncertainty in
 the age of the universe. How and when did our universe begin? Solving that mystery would be an historic
 success at a time when the space program needs it most. In 1986, the nation is in mourning after the
 loss of seven crew members aboard the space shuttle Challenger. This is truly a national loss. The members of the Challenger crew were pioneers. We'll continue our quest in space, the future
 doesn't belong to the faint hearted. It belongs to the brave. They needed something to get back into the
 game, and Hubble was sort of that big shining star. This was a big space telescope and we're gonna
 put this thing into orbit, and it's going to look at black holes. It's gonna figure out where the universe came
 from. It's going to revolutionize astronomy. In charge of this daunting mission is Charlie
 Pellerin. The primary role of Hubble was to fix things
 after Challenger. To show we could still do hard things. I kept reminding myself of John Kennedy when
 he said, ""We choose to go to the moon. Not because it's easy, because it's hard."" We choose to do Hubble because it's hard,
 and it was damned hard. Hubble will far surpass all ground-based telescopes
 for one simple reason. Earth's atmosphere. If you look up at the night sky, the stars
 are gonna appear like they're twinkling, but the star is not changing. What's happening is the, the same kind of
 irregulars in the atmosphere that you encounter when you get turbulence in an airplane, it's
 all over the place. Now, the solution to that is to put a telescope
 above the atmosphere. But unlike ground telescopes, Hubble would
 be orbiting the earth at an astonishing speed of almost five miles per second. And that's a problem. Now of course, the Hubble is this thing in
 space, moving thousands and thousands of miles an hour in orbit, and which means its natural
 tendency is that it's going to be tumbling end over end. It's doing everything but holding still. If you wanna take a snapshot that's clear,
 you know you have to hold your camera very steadily. If you shake your camera, you get a fuzzy
 picture. Same issue with Hubble. The team must find a way to stabilize Hubble
 perfectly. The solution is a gyroscope. Like a top, a gyroscope maintains stability
 by spinning quickly on one axis. The team will equip Hubble with six of the
 most finely balanced gyroscopes ever constructed, each with a wheel spinning 320 times per second. But even the tiniest imprecision in the gyroscopes
 will smear Hubble's images. So, if you ask me before the launch is Hubble
 gonna work, and people did, I would say, ""Of course it's gonna work, cause there's no other
 answer."" What would you say? Would, would you say after you spent almost
 $2 billion and 15 years, would you say, ""Hell, I don't know?"" Or would you say, ""Let's hope so."" What would you say? There's only one answer. ""Of course, it's gonna work."" Let’s go for auto sequence... And lift off of the space shuttle Discovery
 with the Hubble space telescope. Our window on the universe. Okay, we have a go for release and we're gonna
 be a minute late. OK Charlie. Telescope's released. OK thank you. So, the telescope's up, Hubble's working. It's deployed into space, and the shuttle
 comes home. Feeling pretty, pretty, really pretty good
 right now. The flight systems are all working extremely
 well. Almost everything we agonized and worried
 about has done a great job for us. I think that today everything is going exactly
 as we would have hoped. But if we... We had an event about two months later where
 we're gonna look at what's called first light. Charlie is with Chief Engineer Gene Oliver
 when the first images arrive. And I said, ""Gene, wait a minute, wait a minute. That's a fuzzy spot OK?"" He said, ""Huh, don't worry."" I said, ""What do you mean, don't worry?"" He said, ""Well, if it's out of focus, we drive
 the stepping motor in this direction until it's in perfect focus, so no big deal."" Charlie becomes convinced all that's needed
 is a technical adjustment. He leaves for a trip overseas. When he returns, he calls his boss to check
 in. So, he comes on the phone and says, ""Charlie,
 where are you?"" I say, ""I'm in the red-carpet lounge in St
 Louis airport."" And he says to me, ""What do you know about
 sphere collaboration?"" And I said, ""Well all I know is that when
 people, amateurs typically, make a telescope mirror by hand, and they do it sloppily, then
 the telescope's useless."" He said, ""Well I'm glad you know that, because
 you launched Hubble space telescope with a spherically aberrated mirror."" I said, ""Did not."" And he said, ""Did so."" This is two PhD’s, right? And he says, ""Go find the front page of any
 national newspaper and bring it back and read it to me."" So, I come back and above the fold, ""National
 disaster. Hubble launched with flawed mirror."" And he says, ""Now what do you say?"" And I said, ""You guys are good. How did you get a fake newspaper into this
 very lounge that I'm landing in?"" The headline is no fake. Charlie has launched Hubble with a fatal flaw
 and not the one he had feared. Yesterday NASA admitted that its multi-billion-dollar
 eye in the sky has developed blurry vision. We had failed in the most visible possible
 thing we'd done in many many years. I'd have to say it was like a family member
 died. It was like that. I mean, it really was. The observatory will not be sending back the
 spectacular pictures that NASA had promised. The reason is that the mirrors are not focusing
 light properly. To achieve focus, a telescope's mirror must
 be perfectly curved so that its reflected light converges at a single point. After so much worrying about Hubble's ability
 to stabilize itself, Charlie's team made an amateur mistake. Hubble uses a mirror. It's two and a half meters across, eight feet. And it focuses the light to a very very specific
 focus. And if it's off by even a little bit, the
 light won't come to a focus. The problem with Hubble is that it wasn't
 the right shape. I believe that the edge of the mirror, the
 whole error was like a 50th of a human hair. No human could ever look at that mirror and
 suspect there's a problem. We had so many safeguards and I'll look at
 this, and I just go, ""My word."" Boy, we were in so much trouble and didn't
 know it. What, what, what a tragedy. Basically, without some novel technical answer,
 we're screwed. NASA is embarrassed, while across the country
 Charlie and his team are mocked. There was also so much in the media, Hubble
 was the butt of so many jokes. People were saying, ""Well how did we spend
 almost $2 billion and come up with this?"" I tried to avoid the news as much as I could
 but it, it was impossible. It was even in the New York Times, Washington
 Post. It had crying breaking out, and astronomers
 were crying everywhere. One of my most senior people is drunk at his
 desk. When I realised what had happened, I didn't
 believe my personal reputation was in danger. I believed it was ruined. I mean, it was gone. I mean, for this, this level of failure. Arguably the biggest screw up in the history
 of science, and I was the leader of the team, so yeah, it was bad. But Charlie is determined to find a solution. I'm not waiting a minute longer than I have
 to, to get this telescope fixed. I didn't know how to do it. I had no idea if it even was possible yet. After months of searching, his team thinks
 they might have an answer. If the mirror was simply poorly ground to
 a very sloppy weight, it'd be hopeless. But the mirror was perfect, just ground to
 the wrong prescription. When we humans have vision problems, we correct
 that problem by wearing eye glasses, which then are correcting the direction of the light
 and make sure that it is focusing properly. That is basically what the Hubble needed. These glasses would come in the form of a
 machine called Costar. Costar contains five pairs of small mirrors
 on motorized arms. These mirrors correct the light beam entering
 the telescope. Finally, you sorta go, ""My word, we can fix
 this thing."" But with Hubble already in space, this repair
 won't come easy. Kathryn Thornton and her fellow astronauts
 must risk their own safety to save Hubble from disaster. A lot of things can go wrong when you're on
 a spacewalk, but most people when they leave the airlock are not so much afraid that something's
 gonna happen to them, they're afraid they're gonna mess up. That's, that's, sure your biggest concern
 is that, is that our mission was so critical and it was critical that they be done right. Hubble's science instruments are contained
 in four bays. Kathryn must replace one instrument called
 a high-speed photometer, with Costar. Once installed, the corrective mirrors can
 deploy. I mean, remember, this is a huge instrument
 the size of a bus. Nothing like that has ever been done before,
 and it represents a huge number of technological challenges. But Thornton is far from certain that everything
 will go according to plan. And I would have bet money that when we were
 putting these instruments in Hubble, we would have run into some problem that we weren't
 expecting. I tell you, I'm gonna slip over, you got another
 set to keep coming up. Costar is a great big silver box the, the
 size of a phone booth, and I would have bet that things wouldn't fit. And we're gonna slide this thing in and it's
 gonna get halfway in, and it's gonna go kerthunk. And, and hit something. And as bad as it was, we could always make
 it worse. We could have killed it, we could have killed
 it. This is opening the door for Costar. I'm on the end of the mechanical arm, and
 I can recognize that from this picture because I can see the broken red stripes around my
 thighs there. I haven't seen some of this in a long time. This is nice, I like this. We had a lot of eyes watching us. We had everybody on the ground watching, we
 had everybody in the crew module watching us. You know, don't, don't hurt it, don't hurt
 it, don't hurt it. And it's all up to you. Don't screw this up. Costar is, is a pretty big instrument. It weighs several hundred pounds, maybe 700
 pounds on earth, and I can move it with just my fingertips. As Costar slides into place, Thornton can
 only hope that everything will fit. And it just slid right in. I could feel it hit a stop, but that was a
 bit of a relief. The nightmare I'd had didn't happen. But they couldn't calibrate it until after
 we were long gone, and so we had no idea that our mission was successful, even after we
 landed. All anyone can do is wait for the pictures. 11 days later, the calibrations are complete. You know, this was what was happening in December
 of 1993, everybody gathering around the monitors and, and looking at the first images taken
 by Hubble space telescope. And they were gorgeous. I'm sitting there with tears running down
 my face looking at this stuff. And everybody's spellbound. I had no clue that the images would be as
 powerful as they are. I never imagined something like this. This is, this is astounding. It's got to be astounding to anybody. But these are more than beautiful images. Each pixel helps unlock another scientific
 mystery. Cause people was trying to use ground-based
 telescopes to measure the expansion of the universe, and that means uncertainty in the
 age of the universe. But by looking deeper and deeper, it's looking
 farther and farther back in time, and it's measuring the expansion of the universe so
 we can tell precisely when the universe formed, you know, 13.7 billion years ago. Hubble has solved, you know, the, one of the
 biggest mysteries in astronomy and in science. With each image, the discoveries keep coming. The Hubble space telescope makes me feel like
 a kid in a candy store. There, there is no way you're going to be
 able to sample and taste everything that you want to. It just, it amazes me the power of something
 where you are guaranteed to discover something new about the universe. The universe is a pretty big place. So, you need a telescope that can see very
 very far away to even start to get a handle on how the universe is changing over time,
 when it began. In the case of the Hubble space telescope,
 the Hubble space telescope has the power to see on the order of, of, you know, 11 billion
 light years away. And that means you're seeing things as they
 were 11 billion years ago. All of a sudden now, you have a ringside seat
 to watch the entire universe evolve and change in front of you. You can see how fast things were expanding,
 how that whole process worked. And so, for the first time we knew that the
 universe really is about 13.8 billion years, we know how fast it expanded. There are very few times in history where
 you can just take new technology and discover something new, guaranteed. You know, in the case of the Hubble space
 telescope, you could point it somewhere random, and you would see stars and galaxies, and
 objects out there that had never been seen before. How many galaxies are out there? This was something that we wondered. There were theories about. But the Hubble space telescope really showed
 us how many galaxies there are. Hubble actually looked at a blank part of
 the sky, a part of the sky that we didn't think anything was there, and it stared at
 that place for a month. And believe me, this was controversial. Use a month of valuable Hubble time to look
 at nothing? But instead, pixel by pixel, photon by photon,
 Hubble teased out thousands of galaxies. Everywhere in the sky, every tiny point you
 look, is covered with galaxies. They've been invisible to us before, but they
 were there all along, and we are surrounded by them in the hundreds of billions. In every direction we look. They pointed Hubble at a place in the sky
 where there was nothing, and there are like 1500 galaxies in that photo. 1500 galaxies? You know, our Milky Way is just one tiny little
 galaxy. We now know that there are more stars in the
 universe than grains of sand on all the beaches in the world. But Hubble is also a time machine. You see, there's this wonderful look back
 effect, where the farther out in space you look, it took light a long time to get to
 you. And now you look at these images, and you'll
 effectively look back almost to the beginning of time, the beginning of the universe with
 Hubble. This new image from March 2016, is the furthest
 look back in time yet. The light from this young galaxy dates to
 just 400 million years after the Big Bang. It is surprisingly bright, which means that
 galaxies were growing much faster, and much earlier than we ever knew. 25 years after launch, Hubble continues to
 amaze. The idea that somebody could be interviewing
 me and putting these images up in front of me, and have me comment on 'em, and telling
 me that we're in our 25th year of successful science operations... that, that's a mind
 blower. In, in NASA, I think Hubble's only second
 to the moon landing. I mean, it's that big."

stars 4.37 light-years from Earth they are the sun's nearest neighbors there are now hints of something else in this system a planet if it's there it orbits too close to its parent star to bear life as we know it if we find other planets there especially one resembling her some say that will ignite an effort to build a vehicle powerful and speedy enough to get us there interstellar flight is part of a long-standing quest to expand our horizons and go where we've never been what imperatives will define our first interstellar mission when it finally launches and finally arrives a future journey beyond our solar system has been compared to the great human migrations of the past one of the greatest spanned the uncertain reaches of the Pacific Ocean it began 8,000 years ago with the arrival of people on Taiwan off the coast of China by around the Year 1200 ad there are Polynesian descendants arrived at their furthest point Easter Island in a thousand small journeys moving from island to island a seafaring culture emerged what are the Tongass the Fiji's and Easter islands of the future astronomers are now searching in the near regions of our galaxy they have identified 3841 planetary candidates nearly 1,100 have been confirmed the vast majority are Neptune or jupiter-sized planets that orbit close to their parent star by one recent estimate based on data from the Kepler space telescope our galaxy has nine billion stars with planets roughly the size of Earth with conditions that could support life the nearest possibility is a three star system called Alpha Centauri at 4.37 light-years away it's the brightest star in the southern constellation of Centaurus Proxima Centauri a red dwarf is the closest of the trio but so far no planets have been detected Alpha Centauri a is slightly larger and more luminous than our own Sun while V is slightly smaller a team of European astronomers working at the European Southern Observatory in Chile recently detected a subtle wobbling in the light of B it could be a sign of tugging from a planet's gravity if a planet is there it literally hugs its parent star with an orbit that's even closer than mercury is to our Sun it's probably molten with surface temperatures in excess of a thousand degrees centigrade are there other planets far enough out for liquid water to flow that prospect is the subject of intrigue in science and science fiction Alpha Centauri is the fictional location of Polyphemus a giant gas planet and its moon Pandora from the movie Avatar the year is 2150 for Earth has been ruined by environmental catastrophe greedy prospectors board the hybrid fusion antimatter spaceship venture star they descend on an innocent hunter-gatherer people called the Navi could such a place exists this close to home one problem with Alpha Centauri is that the orbits of a and B bring the stars as close as Saturn is to our Sun this means that planets further out could have been pulled away and flung out into space for this reason Alpha Centauri was not a high priority for planet hunters that is until similar examples turned up such as Kepler 16 16b is a planet that orbits two stars which in turn orbit each other or Glaser six six seven a triple star system 22 light years from Earth six six seven see is a red dwarf one-third the mass of our Sun with six planets in its fold three of them small enough to be called super Earth's orbit at a distance that could allow liquid water to flow on their surface that opens the possibility that planets may have survived in the Alpha Centauri system for now that question is on hold the orbits of Alpha Centauri a and B have brought them to close for astronomers to resolve the signal of a planet when they move apart again astronomers will have new tools at their disposal including the James Webb Space Telescope now set for launch in 2018 from a position a million miles away from Earth it will deploy a Sun shield the size of a tennis court and a mirror over 21 feet wide my service will use this telescope with its infrared light detectors to discern the chemical composition of planetary atmospheres here are Alpha Centauri a and B has seen by the Cassini spacecraft just above the rings of Saturn assuming it's worth the trip you'd have to travel a distance 30,000 times the orbit of Saturn to reach them put another way if Earth to Saturn is a meter then Earth to Alpha Centauri is New York to Chicago to put the journey into perspective consider Voyager 2 now on its way out into the galaxy after a series of gravitational assists from Jupiter and Saturn the spacecraft is traveling at about 62,000 kilometers per hour if it were headed in the right direction it would need another 73,000 years to reach Alpha Centauri the dream of traveling to other solar systems was forged by rocketeers a century ago a Russian schoolteacher Konstantin Tsiolkovsky inspired generations of space visionaries with sophisticated ideas about multistage launch vehicles he imagined the construction of space stations in Earth orbit and eventually permanent space colonies someday he predicted will evolve into a whole new species omo cosmic us since then rocket Ray's greatest advances have centered on ways of containing explosive propellants and methods of maintaining stable flight at high speeds the problem with chemical rockets is that they are just not very efficient to reach the speed needed to escape Earth's gravity 25,000 kilometers per hour the space shuttle carried 15 times its weight in fuel a massive study showed that to send a shuttle sized craft to Alpha Centauri in 900 years would take an unbelievable amount of fuel 10 to the 137th kilograms worth that's more than the entire visible universe there are several promising advanced propulsion concepts on the drawing board including fuel efficient plasma engines which accelerate a spacecraft gradually to high speeds it won't get us to Alpha Centauri in anything close to a human lifespan to go that far and that fast a pre Apollo project called Orion called for a series of controlled nuclear explosions to propel a spacecraft to high speeds the project died of it concerns about the impact of nuclear explosions on the environment back in the 1970s a group of scientists unveiled designs for Daedalus this giant fusion powered craft would have had to carry 50,000 pounds of fuel the plan was to accelerate to 12% the speed of light and reach a nearby star in 50 years other plans have included ramjets with vast magnetic fields that scoop up a fuel supply of hydrogen ions or solar sails powered by the solar wind and by lasers stationed along the way then there's the rocket of choice in science fiction powered by the most potent fuel in nature antimatter in James Cameron's Avatar a fusion antimatter hybrid engine powers a 1500 meter long spaceship it makes the journey to Alpha Centauri in just six years antimatter consists of electrons and protons but with their electrical charges reversed whenever it comes into contact with normal matter - to annihilate each other in a ferocious blast of energy only trace amounts can be found in the universe today for example in the high-energy environments of black holes it's so powerful that a mere ten thousandth of a gram is about all it would take to send a spacecraft to Jupiter current designs for an antimatter drive use magnetic fields to isolate and channel the fuel the idea is to merge a stream of protons with a stream of its antimatter opposite antiprotons a magnetic field pinches or compresses the combined streams into a narrow beam annihilation then produces an ultra high-energy laser that shoots out the back of the craft that causes a recoil effect that pushes on the magnetic field produced by the beam and propels the craft forward antimatter can be produced on Earth in giant physics labs like the Large Hadron Collider here scientists accelerate atoms to nearly the speed of light and blast them together to release their fundamental constituents the yield is so small that the cost of producing just a grams worth of antimatter would be upwards of 100 trillion dollars and this stuff is so volatile that storing more than a few atoms at a time remains a significant challenge if specialized facilities were built the cost could drop by one estimate to as low as 10 billion dollars per gram one idea would be to station an antimatter Factory in space powered by the one billion watts per kilometer delivered by the Sun another is to harvest antimatter already produced in space the idea is that cosmic rays interacting with interstellar particles send about a kilogram of antimatter flying into the solar system every second some of it has been shown to circulate in radiation belts that surround the earth theoretically it could be captured by a large magnetic scoop that sits in a high orbit above the planet short of traveling to another solar system there may be good reasons to develop antimatter propulsion an interim mission would speed beyond the orbit of total sending back close-up images of objects in the Kuiper belt a longer distance probe could reveal new details about the Oort cloud a vast realm of comets that envelops the solar system once out there it could sample interstellar particles or deploy an interstellar telescope to make it all the way to Alpha Centauri within 50 years an antimatter probe would have to accelerate to around 10% the speed of light over 100 million kilometers per hour my velocity has its perils at such speeds even dust has enough mass to destroy the craft a magnetic shield would be needed to clear the way if it could be done there may be other destinations to consider at least 22 stars within 12 light years of Earth any way you look at it the first interstellar voyage will be a quantum leap for Humanity the urge to reach out to distant horizons to climb the highest peak is a vital part of human nature but explorers of old set off not just because it was there at times it was greed under fear and despair that propelled them from their homelands and allowed them to endure their long journeys what imperatives will send future generations into space to the physicist Stephen Hawking it's a question of survival I don't think the human race he said will survive the next thousand years unless we spread into space there are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet we can't foresee the impact of wars social upheaval or the course of human civilization in coming centuries but an early context for the mission may be emerging now on one hand the technological advances that might make such a mission possible could revolutionize many other aspects of life on this planet the ever-increasing number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on the computer microchip has become a metaphor for the advance of technology some observers forecast a steep rise even an acceleration in the pace of invention and basic research and for whole new solutions to the problems of energy food production health and more in addition despite the daily drumbeat of violence and war we are actually living in one of the most peaceful eras in human history over the centuries the number of people killed in battle has steadily dropped as civilizations evolved with two world wars the 20th century was pretty bad but the 19th was even worse in terms of deaths per 100,000 from war genocide murder and other factors the world is relatively calm on the other hand major periods of scarcity and suffering may though the last century saw the world's population grow from less than two billion to nearly seven billion today it may reach nine to ten billion by the Year 2040 according to a recent UN report the world will have to produce 70% more food by the year 2050 and at least that much more energy to sustain its population simple clean water in some regions is already extremely scarce now throw in environmental impacts like rising sea levels or the spread of deserts linked to a gradually warming climate no matter how you look at it our world is changing in ways that will impact the way we live and relate to each other will technological advancements allow us to halt the degradation of our natural environments and increase the carrying capacity of our planet will be find ways to mitigate the effects of war natural catastrophes or political upheavals the technology needed to launch a first interstellar mission is certainly decades away the actual journey could take centuries the mission will likely be designed to relay basic information on a world whose light we have studied intensively from afar back home it will no doubt spur reflection on who and what we have become as a people as a planet as our cosmic emissary makes its way across the void we on earth will continue to struggle in our pursuits of happiness prosperity and mere survival when it arrives we'll scan the data for evidence of a world like our own one that may Harbor life will we come to explore and expand our knowledge or to begin a long journey out into the uncertain reaches of the galaxy"

White Star Line left Southampton she was commanded by Captain Smith Commodore of the White Star Fleet and this was to be his last appointment before retiring a crowd had gathered on the pier to watch her leave her moorings the Titanic was a new breed of luxury liner the route for this maiden voyage took her to shurberg and Queenstown where she took on emigrants bound for the new world among her passengers were many of the wealthy and influential with according to one calculation combined assets of a hundred and twenty million pounds there was something about the Titanic it was so very farmer it was so stiff the atmosphere was stiff the coziness well you know they kind of get together feeling it didn't exist always remember going up on the lift a little boy said to me you know madam it's quite an honor I'm only 14 years old I'm a live boy but we were sleeping 6 in a bug and we were treated alike as if we were here third-class rested as de Graaff the food we were not allowed to go at any part of this ship except the deck that we allowed together if you are rich the decks provided a sumptuous way of life the band played the gayest tunes and American ragtime dancers and in the splendor of the cafe Parisi and the light melodies of the day the dining room staterooms and common rooms were furnished in various periods and styles so that English gentlemen might sit in rooms paneled and adorned write their own at home and so that there's extra good food inches could be counteracted they even provided a splendidly equipped gymnasium on Sunday evening April of 14th the night of the gala dinner the band was playing the millionaires were drinking at the bar the Titanic was aglow with glittering lights then three rings on the Bell gave the alarm from the crow's nest and a shot down the telephone ice ahead the time was 11:40 it was a very slight bump just a little jar nothing at all now went in my room there was a second light jar nothing of consequence but you knew something had happened and one man said no dad that's a nice bird and it's a whopper because you know there's one-eighth above the water and 7/8 below and this bloomin things there oh all the way over the top of the ship thought nothing of it we picked up the bits of ice and motiva sprayed snowballs well I've had a lifebelt it went to the cabin to the first class cabins I'll put this older not just not securely and I was walking aimlessly on deck thinking was it an X and looked over the side I saw the boats being launched for the survivors and it supposedly children first side then child's there while looking over the side of the boat one of the crew in the lifeboat shells out the wings a jump or I didn't actually double the both us called across and there it's came roundel Falls topped in the water and I was picked up with a boat that we towed the pick me up a little while later a man came to my door he's Teachman chattering he said madam get up get out do you know they're making a women and children leave in lifeboats they say you're coming back for breakfast you know these crazy English they do anything then we could get up go off and boats and go off and come back for breakfast what do you think of that but before I went unlocked every window in my three staterooms and close every trunk and locked every trunk and took the keys with me 19 keys for 19 drums out of my evening slippers diamond buckles no not real diamonds but diamond and I had a wool cap and two Fox furs and a paper-thin broad tail coat and no underwear and no stockings but a pair of velvet slippers and these buckles now lost a buckle and who should I see mr. monk a miniature painter he said look it's trouble there's just a No well he said you have to jump now into the life oh I said jump with this thing I got on what do you think I am an acrobat or a monkey or something I can't jump in this thing what he says you're after my sister's in that lifeboat well I looked at that lifeboat swinging out on the davits Oh possibly oh I don't know by measurements it was an awful long way and down below was the sea 14 stories below or if we jumped in you fell between no I never would have left the ship but a sailor came along and he said say you you don't want to be saved well I'll save you baby and he grabbed his feet from under my arm and he tossed it in the lifeboat and I turned to this man monk and I said that does it but when they threw that gig I know it was my mother calling me yeah when we look at the figures there were less people say from the steerage class that's right then they were from the first job because they were not allowed to go on a personal stake and that was the only way one could be saved yes in the wireless cabin the two operators Phillips and bride flashed out signals for assistance until the deck was awash did the band actually play music while a ship went down no yeah I heard the band playing with a boat struck when I first tried to give them deck but when I decided to jump off the boat I actually saw the big stand about with the instruments I don't doubt that they were playing music other people heard it but when people say that music played as a ship went down that is a ghastly horrible lie Arthur Lewis the bedroom steward was saved because he was detailed to row one of the lifeboats what were the other passengers like in the lifeboat what I never spoke you see those women the children in the boat all night but they never spoke there's just sit back sit back down there waiting for you picked up did you never talk to each other know what we did know one another so we can get in conversation then the horrible fear was in my heart and I think everybody else's that the dreadful dreadful suction that it drawn us towards the Titanic would Serkis under the Titanic at 2:20 a.m. on Monday the 15th of April and two and a half hours after she struck the iceberg the largest liner afloat slid beneath the black icy waters to the floor of the Atlantic the Titanic carried a total of 2,000 206 passengers and crew 703 people survived the total loss of life was 1503 you"

moonlanding,"Nick Cannon dishes about his holiday plans, reveals why he stood up for his friend Kevin Hart and tells us about his new show, ""The Masked Singer"".",Nick Cannon on Kevin Hart Oscar Backlash,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69a6cdgGLV0,0,1451597,11942,1583,3542,69a6cdgGLV0,"(upbeat techno music) Please welcome, Nick Cannon. (audience cheers) Hello! What's going on? How you doing beautiful? Welcome back. Thank you for having me. (audience yelling) Do I feel cashmere? Yeah, a little cashmere, a little Balmain cashmere. How luxurious! I had to come see you Wendy. I had to show up with the gloves, the shoes, the scarf. Okay. I had to do it all. Give it the shoe cam. Put those feet, now.
 Oh yeah, shoe cam. Damn. Oh wow. Damn. Okay. You know I had to show up and show out. Well you got it like that. I try. You're about to lose your wallet though. It's okay though. Oh that's your phone cover. You got your eyes on my wallet. (audience laughs) Why not? How you been? I've been doing well, it's good to see you. Happy holiday. Happy holidays. (audience claps) But Nick, most noticeably you never age. Where's your afro? Where's my afro? I had to let it go, man. I had to get rid of all the hair. (audience cheering) She stood up for it! She was like, I like that. But you know what, you still have a good hairline so you could do that. I do, I don't know what it is, I was blessed with good genetics I had to throw the waves in there. Does your father still have all hair? He does, he has it all. I thought the hair was a little much, I was looking like a Berenstain Bear. I had to. Now, do I see a slight mohawk? Yeah, that's a little wave-hawk, I had to do it for the young folks. Okay, okay. I had to do it for 'em. How are your kids? They're amazing, thank you for asking. They're excited for the holidays obviously. (audience sighing) Now you're spending holidays sleigh riding from one house to the next? All over, I'm Saint Nick for real. Obviously, I have extended family so I will be visiting many houses over the holidays. But you know what's interesting, I'm starting off in Haiti, where I go to Haiti every year and I give toys to an orphanage down there, so that'll be on like the 23rd. Nice. From there I'll be flying over in my sleigh dropping by. To Mariah's? Of course, I gotta pull up in Aspen, from Haiti to Aspen, to California, I'm all over the place. And then to the oops baby? (laughs) The disrespect! No! The oops baby? Well, we talked about this before when you were on the show. You were only with the girl
 I love you. like it just happened, and all of a sudden she was pregnant. The oops baby? Oh you're not going to pull out a chart on me are you? No! You gon' chart me out here? I was wondering whether it was one of the beautiful girls from Wild 'n Out or who? I mean because you are man about town. Am I? Look Nick. Am I a man about town? Yes! (audience clapping) I'd like to say, I'm a man who is searching for love. True, unconditional love. No you aren't, no you aren't, not yet. Why not? I don't believe it. Why not? 'Cause you are
 I am sensing that you don't understand my pain and my passion of trying to find a true good woman that loves me for me. Nick? I'm just saying. Before I met you, and I was on the radio, and I would talk about you when you and Mariah got together, and you got together quickly, and then got married quickly, and then you got the tattoo, and I didn't believe any of it, and I was like what is she doing with this little boy. He's so corny. Wow.
 He's so corny. And then you met me. And then I met him, here on the show, he's a live wire. (audience claps) Definitely, got all your teeth. All of em, they all here. (laughs) So Kevin Hart in the news, Yes, yes For not wanting to host the Oscars, because of not apologizing. What are your thoughts? My thoughts, I mean I had to stay by my best friend. I mean honestly because I feel like he made a strong decision. He learned from his mistakes, apologized for them and then for this to be brought up again you know, when I know how much this moment meant to him, it was so important to him and then for that
 Do you get paid for host the Oscars?
 to be taken away. I don't even think it's about the money, I mean like. But do you get paid? I think there's a nominal fee or something like that, but honestly I know how much it meant to him and I had to stand up for my best friend. Just to show the selective outrage and hypocrisy that's out there and then you gotta understand. (audience clapping) In moments like this as a community we can all grow because there's a lot of pain in a lot of communities and it's really focused on not about who's right, but about what's right. And if we can focus on the understanding and growing through this pain, that's what it's all about. So I commend Kevin. (audience claps) So a lot of female comedians are online from many years ago. Yeah. Saying a lot of words. 'Lot of words. A lot of words. Who were these girls? You can call them out.
 You know, I would say, and I didn't wanna feel like I was pointing fingers at these-- We are.
 Young ladies 'cause I truly respect them and their craft. I like them. But I'm saying if there's gonna be a double standard let's talk about it and more so, I think we should point the finger at the Academy because if the Academy wants to step up and say you are gonna be held accountable for your past, they should be held accountable for their past. They both use-- (audience clapping) They treated us wrong for so long. Hattie McDaniel had to sit in the back corner of The Oscars the night she won an Oscar for Gone with the Wind. It had to be segregated, we didn't get an apology for that. Yeah. (audience claps) You know two of the comedians that we just showed used the English word (censored) for a cigarette but talking about gay people and then one of them used (censored) Right.
 Yeah, so. It's unfortunate but like I said, let's take this moment to learn and to grow for all of these communities. I mean I've been an advocate for the LGBTQ community for quite some time. I'm on the board for the-- (audience cheers) Saint Judes. Yeah, yeah the global Stomp Out Bullying campaign and I've dealt with some of these young people from this community and all they wanna do is be understood and accepted so let's use this moment to understand them and accept them. (audience claps) Why don't you host? Why don't I host? Don't get involved. I done said too much bad stuff, they gon' find something I done said that's crazy 'cause I'm so outspoken. Like when you were with America's Got Talent. Exactly. Nick is a comedian. Yes. And while he was doing comedy explain what happened. You know again, speaking freely and I'm definitely I'm an advocate of freedom of speech and I said some choice things about my current, not my current my employer at the time and I used some words that they weren't comfortable with and they threatened to fire me in the same way like Kevin. I chose to say, ""You know what? ""Keep your job."" And I kept my dignity. (audience claps) And didn't they call you back? They did, they begged me to come back. And I said, ""No I'm going to host The Masked Singer."" There you go. (audience cheers) So, Pete Davidson. Yes, that's my guy. I love him. Funny, people don't about Pete Davidson it was actually when I was doing my morning show here in New York. I discovered him when he was 15 years old. He would call my morning show everyday saying he wanted to open up for me doing stand-up. Wow. And he did, and I took him on the road with me at like 16, I talked to his mom, got him to finish high school, all of that stuff. And then from that point on, we put him on Wild 'n Out, he got the job on Saturday Night Live, and then he got engaged to Ariana Grande. Wow. Did he come to you for advice? He did, he called me before he popped the big question and all of that. Now let me guess, you were all for it? I said ""rumble young man, rumble."" Go 'head all. (laughs) As one who gets married quick. The funny thing he called me he's like ""I'm walking in your footsteps for real."" I was like ""Ay, slow down Paco."" Like you know like. It can get a little crazy, but he's dealing with it in such a, I would say a poised way. I commend him, he's a great comedian, a great talent, he's gonna go on to be a huge star. You know, his relationships will be the small footnote in his career. (audience claps) So you were doing an interview, and during the interview the interviewer asked you something about Kim Kardashian. Right. And you, you said. What you say? You're always getting me in trouble, Wendy. Tell us what you said. I don't know what I said. I do a lot of interviews, like you, you asked me about my personal life Oh, excuse me. And I don't back down from any question that's why me and Wendy get along. 'Cause you ask me something, I'ma give you the honest truthful answer and some people ain't always gonna like those answers. Well I forgot the quote, but whatever it was, it was something like, ""She's got a fat ass."" Did I say that? Yes. I didn't say that.
 Yes you did. I mean it's true but I didn't say that. (audience laughing)
 Yes you did, yes you did. I did not say that. You said she's got a fat ass I would never say that. I'm way more articulate to say someone has a fat-- No you aren't, I know you better. I was saying it was like succulent, or it was voluptuous. I wouldn't say fat ass. Okay, then you used one of those theatrical words. Yeah, it was a nice rotund, round, derriere. So then Kanye jumps on social media and has a fit and tells you in a video don't you ever talk about my wife ever again, keep her name out of your mouth. Like really? It's outta your mouth. You know what? It's funny because Kanye is someone that I grew up with. I always tell people I think I introduced Kim and Kanye to be honest. But, he's been a friend for so long-- Here, you can have her, I had her already. Aww, see? (audience yells) That ain't right. I did not say that. See, this how I get in trouble. Kim Kardashian is an upstanding, beautiful, amazing American citizen that we all respect and I'm not saying anything disrespectful about the West-Kardashian clan. But here's the thing, I think that's such a non-factor It is.
 in the man, that you are today. Thank you. Can you not talk about that anymore? You talking about it! No, I talked about it. She brought it up. How you gonna tell me not to talk about something that you talking about? I talked about it because I wanted you to talk about it here but-- But after this, no more? Right! So what if the next person asks me about my past? Everyone else is a softy, they're not gonna press, press, press. Let's do this. Can we not talk about Kim, Mariah, such and such? Let's talk about me. No, Mariah. Kim doesn't have babies by you as far as I know. Why does it always have to be somebody's personal life? Because Mariah's part of your personal life, she's a-- I love her, I respect her, she's the mother of my children, I will only have great things to say about her, but we shouldn't have to. Every interview people always want to talk about my personal life. Because it's very personal. (laughs) Is my personal life that interesting, ya'll? (audience yells) Yes it is. I'm enrolled in college, I go back to the prison systems and teach-- Nick. Nick. Nick. We can talk about everything And since you have a late night talk show about to come out, congratulations. Thank you. (audience cheers)
 Let's talk about that! Now I get to talk about other people's business, I get to sit where you get. And then-- And you gonna come on my show and I can talk about all your personal business. And then people will talk about you. There it is. And that's one of the reasons why I wanted to do it because I felt like, it's a homogenized time slot when you think about late-night. It's a lot of guys named James and Jimmy in there and I need to put some of this swag up in there and talk to them real quick. (audience clapping) Will it be a guest show or just you talking mass or? I mean I'ma gonna take some pages out of your book, I mean you it so well.
 Everyone does. Yeah, everybody be copying. I might do some hot topics. Hot topics, ask Nick. All of that good stuff. Go sit in the audience. Shoe cam, all that. Yep, all that. We should do the show together, Wendy. You should be my first guest. (audience cheers) I'll be your first guest.
 Wendy's gonna be my first guest! But I don't do co-hosts. No. You just come rock with me. The same way the first time I came on your show I was a little reluctant. You stayed the whole time. And I stayed the whole time. And we had a wonderful time. And I think you should do the same thing on my show when I do one. (audience cheers) I'll think about it. You'll think about it? But I do wanna be a guest. Absolutely! Now this show The Masked Singer. Yes. It's a little confusing. (laughs) It's a little crazy. The outfits are beautiful by the way. Yeah, yeah. All the budget is being spent on the outfits. Absolutely, we have an amazing costume designer now. The thing about this show, I said I was not gonna host another competition show until I heard this concept. It's a global phenomenon, it's been a big hit in other territories, and you know, I'm the co-executive producer as well so, I was like you know what? Thank you. (audience claps) It's our time in America to do this show that's been working all over the world. And the fact is it's A-list celebrities dressed up in full costume head-to-toe singing their hearts out to win the golden mask. So you get a little bit of The Voice, you get a little bit of Got Talent, you get a little bit of Dancing with the Stars, Halloween, everything all mixed up in one. So there's no money involved, it's winning a mask? Yeah, the people in the mask are already rich, they don't need no money. And who are the judges? Well I like to call them the panel because they do so much more than judge, they actually trying to figure out. They're our investigators, yeah we got Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong, Nicole Scherzinger, and my man Robin Thicke. Nice. The best-looking and most talented panel on television I would say. Okay.
 Yeah. Well good luck with that. Tell us about this book, I'm curious. Oh yeah I wrote a romance novel. King of the Dancehall. (audience yells) And it's funny because, I actually, I turned it into a film as well. It debuted at the Toronto Film Festival, it's been all over, won a bunch of awards and stuff because it's all about the subculture of dancehall and the Jamaican Caribbean culture that's so rich and sexy. Ooh! Get sexy. Yum. Thank you Nick for being here. Everybody give it up for Nick Cannon. The Masked Singer premieres January 2nd on Fox. Everyone here is going home with a copy of Nick's book. You get the book! King of the Dancehall. (upbeat techno music)"
moonlanding,"CBS Report on Air France flight number 447: In response to the release of the final report on the crash, Captain SUllenberger comments on the event and what brought airliner down.",Air France 447: Final report on what brought airliner down,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kERSSRJant0,0,1341648,4733,439,2854,kERSSRJant0,"for more than two years a few pieces of debris floating in the Atlantic Ocean were all that was left of Air France flight 447 and the answer to what happened seemingly lost forever on the ocean floor but in May of 2011 state-of-the-art submarines made a remarkable dive more than two miles below the ocean's surface and collected the crucial black box expert analysis of the reported cockpit transcripts point to a perfect storm of problems including stormy weather aircraft malfunction and pilot error but some say there was another contributing factor the very design of the airbus cockpit what Air France 447 have had the same disaster if this cockpit were a Boeing instead of an Airbus I think it would have been much less likely to happen in a Boeing because the control wheels are large they're obvious I think it could hardly have been missed what's the last time you were in one of these to help us break down and understand what happened on board Air France flight 447 CBS News aviation and safety expert captain Chesley Sully Sullenberger took us into an Airbus simulator this is going from neutral to full nose up command full aft side stick that's it right there that one little movement that small movement on the Airbus flight controls or side stick raises the nose of the plane and instructs it to climb pilots rarely perform the maneuver at high altitudes because it can be very dangerous but that is exactly what one flight 447 pilot did around 2:05 a.m. when the airbus a330 was flying through a storm system all three of its speed indicators stopped working as a result the aircraft's autopilot turned off with a captain on break the two Co pilots were forced to fly the plane manually the least experienced pilot 32 year-old Pierre Bona was in the right seat and said I have the controls copilot david robear was in the left seat and even though considerably more experienced he let buona fly theoretically it was possible to apply the airplane those conditions challenging but manageable yes although they lost the autopilot and speed indicators they were flying normally and safely but then suddenly and without robear knowing bone and does something almost inexplicable he pulls back on his side stick and raises the nose of the plane that causes the aircraft of fall and the stall warning sounds minutes the stall warning will sound 75 times but strangely neither pilot will mention it and unbeknownst to robear Bona will keep the nose of the plane up almost the entire time exactly what he shouldn't do a decision that experts still can't understand it's difficult to explain that I just don't know why he did that and there's nothing to you that makes sense on on any experience or intellectual level about pulling back when you should push forward no nothing at all because of bonus actions the plane is attempting to climb but is actually losing altitude robear appears to have no idea the nose is being lifted when he says what the hell is happening I don't understand what's happening if he had known what Bonin was doing where a bear could have conceivably solved the problem very easily at this point so you're sitting where Bonin was sitting and he starts pulling back and right Sullenberger showed us why he thinks in this situation the design of the airplane helped keep robear in the dark and it's a subtle movement compared to more traditional airplanes and unless I happen to notice you visually doing it I would have no way of telling the writer but it does because your science dick is not linked to mine when I moved this one that one never budgets by traditional airplanes Sullenberger means those built by Boeing there are only two major airliner manufacturers in the world Boeing and Airbus and the two have different cockpit designs and philosophies the main difference Airbus uses sidestick technology boeing uses a yoke and this airplane you have a big control wheel it's right in front of both pilots we sat down in a Boeing 747 simulator to see the difference there mechanically linked they're not independent so if if I move mine yours moves in unison had he been pulling back in a Boeing how would it have looked like this and on my side it's in my life yes robear would clearly have known what was happening if this was happening in a Boeing I think it would be obvious yeah Airbus didn't respond to our request for comment however they have never wavered in their public support of their cockpit design at 2:10 a.m. five minutes after the autopilot disengaged the airbus a330 continues to lose significant altitude as the captain brie enters the cockpit and says what the hell are you doing Bona the least experienced pilot continues to hold back on his side stick but still doesn't seem to understand what's happening we've lost control of the airplane banaz says robear tells the captain we've totally lost control of the plane we don't understand it all almost a minute later as the plane is now just 10,000 feet above the surface of the ocean but net finally reveals the crucial information they've needed he shouts I've had to stick back the whole time robear seems to instantly realize what's going on he jumps in and says give me the controls give me the controls but it's too late about 40 seconds later the two co-pilots say what will be their last words robear damn it we're going to crash this can't be happening banana but what's happening four seconds after that the voice recorder cuts out it's clear that the pilot of Airbus have to work as a team man Roberts ULA's lost his 24 year old daughter Caroline in the crash her husband of just two years was a flight attendant on board I was alone on the earth nothing to speak no a lot of questions with no answer 228 people lost their lives that night after analyzing debris and examining remains experts suspect passengers likely didn't know what was going wrong until they had the oceans surface a tiny bit of Solace in one of modern Aviation's biggest disasters we don't want that the victims dead for nothing Sulis and everyone who lost someone that night want answers but industry experts want more beyond increased pilot training if deemed necessary even changes to the cockpit design so the circumstances that took down flight 447 never happened again if we only blame the pants we will not have changed any of the fundamental underlying conditions we would have done our best to prevent this from happening again"

It's like what the medical medium recommends only better!",I Tried Celery Juice for 7 Days and This is What Happened!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlPuKjj-EIw,0,188069,9093,223,1354,VlPuKjj-EIw,hey guys you've probably heard about this out we juice craze right now celery is the kanye west to vegetables so I decided I would try it for seven days and I want to share with you what happened but first a couple of thoughts there's a hell phenomena that happens where if everybody is doing a thing and then I start doing that thing my health will improve that's how health and nutrition works and stuff it's like being a sheep without the meat hashtag vegan and that's why I want to try celery juice for seven days celery juice really does so much it's kind of miraculous it cures skin issues digestive issues narcissism bedwetting it kills pathogens gives you more energy makes you more beautiful and strengthens your bones so here's how you do celery juice you want to drink 16 ounces first thing in the morning on an empty stomach so all you need to do is buy it watch it and then because nature is stupid and accidentally puts the juice inside the celery you'll need to use a juicer to correct nature's mistake by extracting the juice and you'll love how quick and easy cell reduces - it only takes two minutes to wash the celery five minutes to juice it two minutes to drink it then about 90 minutes to clean your juicer but hey a little time-saving tip don't wash your celery or clean your juicer and it is important to drink your celery juice out of a jar because it'll make you feel like you're from Portland and that's cool don't watch and see what happened to me on my seven-day celery juice journey okay guys so day one I've just made my juice and I'm about to try it for the first time wish me luck oh my god it's not that bad it's taste nutritional you know like the juice that comes out in the bottom of a garbage bag on a hot summer day it tastes like that except like the garbage of people who eat organic alive I already feel more energy in like 11 times more purified hey guys its 15 minutes later and I'm getting a little urgent surprise I'm getting even more benefit from the celery juice because now I have diarrhea and I usually just have normal healthy poop so I guess the juice has cheered me of that oh my god just two days in and I am feeling so well hydrated it's shocking to think that drinking a bunch of liquid could hydrate me but that's one of the magical properties that only celery juice has also kind of exciting things changed up a bit where the loose stools didn't come on the toilet hey guys well I don't need the toilet anymore JP I'm done with the bathroom and you need it to wait so day three I decided today to use a nut milk strainer and a high speed blender to show you how easy it is in case you don't have a juicer and I can totally tell my skin is getting so clear it's just fabulous look and I also feel a lot stronger like I think athletes should just drink celery juice instead of taking steroids to get stronger it'd probably work a lot better okay guys day 4 now usually it's important to use only organic celery because non-organic celery is one of the most heavily sprayed foods with pesticides but because my self worth it's a little bit low today I decided to use non-organic celery as a way of saying you to me the celery is so anti-inflammatory I think it just cured my autism and it's only four days into it do my boobs look denser to you I think they're getting denser oh my god guys today the store was completely sold out of celery that's how popular this cleanses which really reaffirms how effective it is so accordingly I didn't drink any celery juice today then I kept feeling even better that's how powerful salary juice is but my diarrhea did go away for some reason that's probably the only negative scored more celery today guys back on the Jews hey now because celery is such a powerful purifier today I'm feeling a lot of detox symptoms at the headache my stomach really hurts really low-energy brain fog feels like I'm losing my health but I know I'm getting healthier because I learned how to call these negative destructive symptoms detox reactions and that makes them healthy oh and even better my diarrhea came back today it's the final day of drinking celery juice it has completely transformed my life I feel like the celery juice has helped me weave right into the fabric of nutritional pop culture and that makes me feel included today I noticed I don't have a lephant itis so I think it's safe to say that celery juice prevents elephantitis I also think I don't have polio so you can just drink celery juice instead of getting vaccinated if you want so in conclusion you gotta try celery juice for seven days guys you're gonna love it I just wish they discovered celery before 2019 I have the more energy than a cocaine addict working on Wall Street I think clear and has killed more pathogens that I haven't seen that I can count I can honestly say celery juice has changed my life and it also forces me to change my pants often - hey guys thanks for watching please leave a comment below sharing what kind of miracle salary juice has done for you
moonlanding,"MORE HERE: Kubrick's Notes on The Shining - http://bit.ly/2vX01K1

Whenever I think of The Shining, I’m always amazed by the sheer number of iconic moments in a single movie. So, I wanted to take a look at the writing process and see how we ended up with such a masterpiece of cinema. Now, there have been plenty of great videos on The Shining as well as videos specifically about the script, but I want to go deeper. What exactly is happening from a storytelling perspective? 

What was it like to collaborate with Kubrick on this screenplay? How did the movie wind up so different than Stephen King’s original novel? How close did they stick to the screenplay during production? What were Kubrick’s thoughts on horror? All that and more on this episode of Making Film...

 amazed by the sheer number of iconic moments in a single movie. So, I wanted to take a look at the writing
 process and see how we ended up with such a masterpiece of cinema. Now, there have been plenty of great videos
 on The Shining as well as videos specifically about the script, but I want to go deeper. How was it written and what exactly is happening
 from a storytelling perspective? What was it like to collaborate with Kubrick
 on this screenplay? How did the movie wind up so different than
 Stephen King’s original novel? How close did they stick to the screenplay
 during production? What were Kubrick’s thoughts on horror? All that and more on this episode of Making
 Film... In 1975, Barry Lyndon had hit the theaters
 and Stanley Kubrick was eager to find a subject for his next film. After he finishes a film, he just begins to
 read anything he can get his hands on, hoping to find a subject that has certain cinematic
 possibilities. Kubrick: ""I don’t find any systematic way
 of reading. It’s a terrifying prospect when you realize
 all the books there are in the world that you’re never going to read or that you should
 read, so I find by just reading at random, that seems like the best approach” (A Voix
 Nue). There was an interesting bit in American Film
 magazine, which noted that Kubrick acquired many books on the supernatural. He would sit in his office and read. it across the room against the wall.” Apparently Kubrick’s secretary outside noticed
 that the sounds of books hitting the wall had stopped. She went in and found him reading The Shining
 (Kubrick Companion). It’s hard to tell if there is much truth
 to this story, but John Calley, an executive at Warner Brothers, sent Kubrick the manuscript
 of The Shining and when asked about the book, Kubrick said, ""The Shining I found very compulsive
 reading, and I thought the plot, ideas, and structure were much more imaginative than anything I’ve ever read in the genre” (The Soho News Interview). Warner Brothers had bought the rights to Stephen
 King’s book shortly after it was published in 1977 and they also bought a screenplay
 based on the book written by King himself (Kubrick Companion). However, Kubrick wanted to use the novel as
 simply a jumping-off point and therefore he didn’t read King’s screenplay nor did
 he wish to collaborate with him on a new screenplay (Kubrick Companion). It’s interesting to note that nearly all
 of Kubrick’s films are adapted from previous books and there are a couple of reasons for
 this: First, Kubrick felt that there aren’t many
 original screenwriters who are at a high enough caliber as some of the greatest novelists—
 unless they plan on directing the film themselves. And second, and perhaps most important, is
 that it allowed him to see the story more written, you have the irreplaceable experience
 of reading it for the first time. This is something which you obviously cannot
 have if you write an original story” (Archives). This way, Kubrick could experience the story
 as a whole and an entirely unique experience and then evaluate what it was about the book
 that affected him. He could get at the core of what was good
 about the story, strip away the clutter, and enhance the most brilliant aspects with a
 profound sense of hindsight. (Something we probably all wish we could do
 with certain movies). For the task of adapting the book for the
 screen, Kubrick enlisted the help of novelist Diane Johnson. He had met her in 1976, when he considered
 making a film adaptation of her book The Shadow Knows-- a psychological thriller about a woman
 harassed by an unknown menace (Kubrick Companion). They had discussed the book extensively and,
 at the time, she was teaching a class at UC Berkeley on the Gothic novel (New Perspectives
 285). So, when he ultimately decided on pursuing
 a film adaptation of The Shining he thought that it would be interesting to work with
 her. which, indeed, she proved to be” (Archives). In early 1977, Johnson spoke at length with
 Kubrick over ten days and then she received an outline later that year (New Perspectives
 285). It wasn’t until March 17th, 1978 that Johnson began working with Kubrick on the story full-time (New Perspectives 288). She said, ""The driver would come and pick
 me up every morning and drive me out there I would stay all day, through dinner. We would work in the morning and then Stanley
 would have a lot of things to do because he was doing the sets and the second unit were
 already in America” (New Perspectives 288). Johnson and Kubrick had long discussions around
 literature, particularly Gothic horror— Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and stories
 by Edgar Allan Poe. They also watched movies every night—many
 of them starred Jack Nicholson specifically to see whether they liked him more as a “depressive” or a ""hyped-up animated"" character (New Perspectives 288). They discussed The Shining for over a month
 before writing a single word (Kubrick Companion). Many of their discussions started from simple
 questions posed by Kubrick. Johnson said, ""Stanley uses the Socratic method:
 is the husband a nice man? Does his wife love him? What kind of clothes would she wear? In this way, Kubrick got to know and understand
 his characters before setting them in motion for themselves"" (Kubrick Companion). Johnson also said, Kubrick’s ""approach was
 very literary and intellectual, he was big on outlines, big on lists and he focused on
 clearly expressing the implications of a scene or the problems that it posed” (New Perspectives
 288). They also drew a fair amount of inspiration
 from Bruno Bettelheim’s study of fairy tales titled, The Uses of Enchantment and the writings
 of Sigmund Freud, but more on that later (Kubrick Companion). Johnson and Kubrick each came up with their
 own short plot outline for The Shining based “more fleshed-out outline” (Archives). They worked on the screenplay for 11 weeks
 in England and then Johnson left for the United States (New Perspectives 288). She returned to England in 1978 for a few
 weeks to work on the script during shooting. Johnson said, there were ""a lot of phone conversations
 about details and things. When I left the second time there was a pretty
 good script. Stanley went on to make some changes but most of them he checked with me” (New Perspectives 288). Without Johnson’s contributions to the screenplay,
 the film might be very different and it is important to recognize the work that she put
 into crafting such a great adaptation with Kubrick. On October 17th, 1979, Kubrick had her contact
 the Writers Guild to notify them that he wanted there to be a shared screenwriting credit
 on all of the publicity and advertising (New Perspectives 289). Kubrick’s first treatment, completed on
 June 20, 1977, was 36 pages and contained 61 scenes. The treatment ends when Grady removes the
 bolt to the pantry door freeing Jack. This is one of the most important moments
 in the film as it is the first time there is any evidence of a ghost having any affect
 on the physical world. All supernatural aspects of the film up to
 that point could very well be happening only in the minds of the characters or have some
 other explanation (SK Reads SK). Wendy: “You did this to him! Didn’t you!?” Kubrick: ""I’ve always enjoyed the genre
 and I felt that I hadn’t really seen a picture that presented that genre. There have been pictures which have had shocks
 in them and which have had some wonderfully gory or horrific moments. get involved in the story and the supernatural
 events were presented in a way which seemed dramatically realistic. What I found so ingenious about the way the
 novel was written, as the very supernatural events occurred, which you always wonder to
 yourself, ‘how is the writer ever going to explain this?’. The way the story is written, you assume as
 you read it that the things that are happening are probably going to be a product of his
 imagination. And I think this allows you to start accepting
 them, and not worry. It isn’t really until the bolt is open that
 you’re absolutely certain that it isn’t a product of his imagination” (A Voix Nue). The guiding principle for Kubrick’s journey
 into horror came from an H.P. Lovecraft essay that states, “In all things
 that are mysterious—never explain” (Soho News Article). Kubrick expands upon this in an interview
 saying, ""as long as what happens stimulates people’s imagination, their sense of the
 uncanny, their sense of anxiety and fear. And as long as it doesn’t, within itself,
 have any obvious inner contradictions, it is just a matter of, as it were, building
 on the imagination (imaginary ideas, surprises, etc.), working in this area of feeling”
 (The Soho News Interview). Kubrick was keen on using the audience’s
 own imagination against them and, by introducing mystery and the suggestion of horror, the
 audience can fill in the blanks with their own fears. The story beats are very simple, there isn’t
 a big convoluted story to follow like in many horror films. Instead, we are watching with a mindset based
 more on emotion over logic, but we get both. We get lost in the mystery, but we are also
 concerned with survival. We experience the fear of the mystery and
 the logical thinking of how to escape the situation. Kubrick uses the first expositional scenes
 to tell us, more or less, that this guy is going to go crazy and try to murder his family
 and this boy is a clairvoyant. In this way, we are placed in a similar situation
 as Danny. We know Jack will go crazy, but there isn’t
 anything we can do about it. Then we are left to watch it all unfold. Jack: “Well, you can rest assured, Mr. Ullman,
 that’s not going to happen with me.” In early versions of the script, quite a great
 deal was explained, in fact, there was a storyline that was discarded that involved Danny finding
 a scrapbook full of newspaper clippings of all of strange things that have happened at
 the Overlook Hotel. There was another version where Jack finds
 it in the cellar as well as a version where the scrapbook just appears on his desk (SK
 Reads SK 192). We can see the scrapbook on his desk in the
 final film, however, there is no mention of it. Another guiding principle was raised by Kubrick
 in a separate interview. He says, ""... in fantasy you want things to
 have the appearance of being as realistic as possible. People should behave in the mundane way they
 normally do. You have to be especially careful about this
 in the scenes which deal with the bizarre or fantastic details of the story” (Archives). This contrast makes the extraordinary more
 powerful and we can see this in the actors as well (Archives). Mundane Fantastic The opening scenes are presented almost exceedingly
 ordinary... Hallorann: “How do you folks like our hotel
 so far?” Wendy: “Oh, it’s just wonderful! Hi Danny!” Since the beginning, Kubrick knew that he
 didn’t want the ghosts to be bright or transparent as you see in most film and television depictions
 of spirits. He said that, in the stories of people who
 have claimed to see ghosts, they are always described as solid and seeming very much like
 a real person (A Voix Nue). Films and television often use transparency
 to help communicate to the audience that what we are seeing is a spirit. Kubrick subverts this and uses context, but
 there is actually a deeper reason why Kubrick would choose to depict the ghosts as solid
 and somewhat normal looking human beings. You see, Johnson and Kubrick drew a great
 deal of inspiration from Freud’s essay on The Uncanny. If I’m understanding it correctly, Freud
 defines the uncanny by using the German word heimlisch which means ‘homely’ or ‘cozy/comfortable’
 but uses unheimlisch to refer to a feeling of uncomfortableness inside the home. It is something unfamiliar and possibly threatening
 within something that is familiar. This can refer to the Overlook seeming like
 a perfectly normal hotel with some unknown interior threat, but it can also relate to
 people. Freud notes the fear of inanimate objects
 somehow becoming sentient, like in Poltergeist (although he says that, this is not usually
 terrifying for small children who often treat inanimate objects like living things for fun). And in Poltergeist, the youngest character
 has the least amount of fear. Carol: “They’re heeeere…” However, as Freud points out, the reverse
 is also terrifying—something that looks like a person, but is not. We can see this in the most terrifying moments
 such as the Grady Twins and the woman in the bathtub. We don’t know what these people are or what
 they are capable of and we don’t know if they exist at all or if there is some sort
 of disturbance in the characters’ minds. Perhaps the most terrifying of all is a combination
 of these two concepts— at the beginning, Jack Torrance seems normal and he is a familiar
 member of the Torrance family, but over the course of the film, he becomes something unfamiliar,
 looking like himself, but his actions and psychosis make him a threat. We can see a similar concept at play a few
 years earlier in William Friedkin’s The Exorcist where a woman’s young daughter
 is possessed by a demon. Incidentally, Kubrick was offered the job
 of directing The Exorcist but turned it down. Despite really enjoying Stephen King’s book,
 Kubrick knew that the story had to be substantially changed in order to bring it into the medium
 of film. Kubrick said, ""The main problem with The Shining
 was to work out the structure of the story and to reinvent those paragraphs where the
 action was insufficient. (...) Diane and I talked endlessly about the
 book, and then we designed the frame for the scenes, which we thought the movie should
 contain. The scenes on this list were changed over
 and over again until we were satisfied” (S.K. reads S.K. 190). I imagine he means cutting the inner monologues
 and much of the dialogue of the book and trying to translate the story into something more
 visual. Now, I’m not very familiar with the book,
 but there are some notable changes from the book as well as many iterations of the script. The bigger changes, in terms of character,
 were making Wendy into a weaker mousy character because Kubrick thought she was more realistic
 for the purpose of the story and a stronger woman would be less likely to put up with
 Jack. This change actually happened fairly late
 in the writing process (S.K. reads S.K. 190). They also used the H.P. Lovecraft principle and removed most of the
 backstory save for a couple of remarks throughout— most of which are in the scenes with Lloyd
 the bartender. Kubrick said, ""From Jack’s character, for
 instance, all the rather cumbersome references to his family life have disappeared in the
 film, and that’s for the better. I don’t think the audience is likely to
 miss the many and self-consciously ‘heavy’ pages King devotes to things like Jack’s
 father’s drinking problem or Wendy’s mother. To me, all that is quite irrelevant. There’s the case of putting in too many
 psychological clues of trying to explain why Jack is the way he is, which is not really
 important” (The Soho News Interview). I think that is a major key in what makes
 Jack so scary— we don’t have a real sense of his humanity. The earlier treatments stuck much closer to
 the book. One early treatment explained the woman in
 the bathtub as a victim of suicide, which These early treatments also had Tony, you
 know, Tony as a character who Danny would actually see. Hallorann trekking out to the hotel after
 a telepathic communication from Danny and the ballroom scene with Grady are some of
 the earliest plot points that that made it through each version and into the final film
 (S.K. reads S.K. 191). The second draft of the screenplay, from July
 12, 1977, actually contained a scene with Danny and the woman in room 237—which happens
 off-screen in the final film. What’s interesting is that this version
 of the script describes the ball rolling up to Danny with the sound of the Grady twins
 giggling and possibly glimpses of them, letting us know not only who rolled the ball, but
 that the twins and the woman are somehow connected (S.K. reads S.K. 191). And, as some have pointed out, it is possible
 that Kubrick isn’t cutting between the old woman with Jack and the same woman in the
 tub. They might be two different people. You can see that one has much shorter hair. Perhaps they are the Grady twins. As for the third draft, from August 1, 1977,
 we could have actually seen Jack’s nightmare of him killing Wendy and Danny as well as
 a flashback where Jack beats up a student, which caused him to be fired from his teaching
 job (S.K. reads S.K. 191). According to an essay by Ursula Von Keitz,
 these scenes were removed to ensure that we are kept in the present as the characters
 are experiencing it (S.K. reads S.K. 191). The fourth draft, dated August 15, 1977, is
 the first time there is some kind of ending written and, boy, is it a doozy. Jack surprises Wendy and Danny after he is
 freed from the pantry and he injures her. She hits Jack with a rifle butt and then Hallorann
 arrives at the hotel and is hit in the head by Jack. Wendy kills Jack and rushes to help Hallorann
 and then a grinning Grady walks up to them and greets Hallorann by saying: “Good evening, chief.” The script ends with forest rangers entering
 the hotel filled with snow from broken windows “blown his brains out” (S.K. reads S.K. 191). There were really an incredible amount of
 iterations of the script. Here are just some of the ideas that were
 included in drafts that were ultimately scrapped: Tony speaks with a voiceover, Hallorann arrives
 at the hotel and turns evil with Grady and fights with Wendy, Halloran becomes demonic
 with destructive powers, Danny finds bloody girls’ shoes in a sand pit, Danny sees a
 wall covered in blood and brain matter, a flashback of the incident when Jack injured
 Danny, and a version with more Native American imagery including a mask that appears in Danny’s
 visions (S.K. reads S.K. 194, 195). I believe that some of these were taken from
 the book, but speaking of the novel... One of the more brilliant changes from the
 book was in Hallorann’s demise. In the book Hallorann journeys to the hotel
 and saves Wendy and Danny and the film sets this thread in motion only to have Hallorann
 axed the moment he shows up at the hotel. I love the idea of this moment surprising
 the people who had previously read the book because this moment marks a point where they
 too don’t know what will happen next. One thing that's really cool is all of the
 notes by Kubrick in the margins of the script as well as the book. We can really get a sense that new ideas were
 constantly being tested and the script was being distilled and simplified and refined. I’ve made a page with the notes I was able
 to find. Click the card to check it out. Jack: “Go check it out!” Now, as Lessons From the Screenplay mentioned,
 the actual scripts for The Shining are only available to see at the Kubrick Archives in
 London. However, I imagine that if you had the chance
 to read them, you might find them fairly unremarkable. The purpose of these drafts was to get a sense
 of what the film would be, but it was all very fluid. Diane Johnson was quoted saying, ""The writing
 was secondary to knowing who the characters were, what the events were, and the exact
 function of every scene. Stanley kept saying, 'When you know what's
 happening in a scene, the words will follow’"" (Archives). It wasn’t until the production itself that
 the script entered a completely new phase of rewriting. Kubrick:“But I find that the structure, you
 know, the events, if they’re right, you know, if the moments are right, it usually
 is fairly simple to write the scene. There are times in various films where there
 hasn’t even been time to write the scene. It’s never been solved until, say, two days
 before you do it, you just couldn’t think. Once you know what’s supposed to happen,
 really, you sort of write the scene on the actors— as it were—in the rehearsal. I mean, that part of the scene, the dialogue,
 is not the most difficult. It isn’t in this type of story. It is, obviously, in a film where someone
 is going to sit and talk for thirty minutes in one place, you know, like a play. When the attitude of the people is correct
 and the purpose of the scene is correct and the action of the scene is interesting, then
 the rest of it is pretty simple” (A Voix Nue). Kubrick’s approach during the production
 phase was to get the actors to collaborate on their character, make suggestions, and
 this way, the story is constantly getting better even as it is being filmed. Kubrick said, ""The key part in shooting a
 film is not to necessarily execute what you When asked if he lets the actors improvise,
 Kubrick said, “Yes. I find that no matter how carefully you write
 a scene, when you rehearse it for the first time there always seems to be something completely
 different, and you realize that there are interesting ideas in the scene which you never
 thought of, or that ideas that you thought were interesting aren’t. Or that the weight of the idea is unbalanced;
 something is too obvious or not clear enough, so I very often rewrite the scene with the
 rehearsal. I feel it’s the way you can take the best
 advantage of both the abilities of the actors and even perhaps the weaknesses of the actors. If there’s something they aren’t doing,
 or it’s pretty clear they can’t do (I must say that’s not true in The Shining
 because they were so great), you suddenly become aware of ideas and possibilities which
 just didn’t occur to you” (The Soho News Interview). Diane Johnson: “When it came to the shooting,
 he cut out a lot of Wendy’s lines… They didn’t get along (he and Shelly Duvall)
 and he didn’t like the way she would say the lines. And so he’d say, ‘oh, well then nevermind. Cut that.’ And so, finally it came down to her just screaming
 a lot, basically, as you probably remember.” If something isn’t working, it is usually
 the script that is the issue. There really isn’t a point in trying to
 stick so rigidly to the script if it doesn’t work with the actors or some other reason. Kubrick continues saying, ""I’ve always been
 impressed reading that some directors sketch out the scenes and can actually find that
 it works. It may be some shortcoming of my screenplay,
 but I find that no matter how good it ever looks on paper, the minute you start in the
 actual set, with the actors, you’re terribly aware of not taking the fullest advantage
 of what’s possible if you actually stick to what you wrote. I also found that thinking of shots, or thinking
 of the way to shoot a scene before you’ve actually rehearsed it and got it to the point
 where something is actually happening that is worth putting on film, will frequently
 prevent you from really getting into the deepest possible result of the scene” (The Soho
 News Interview). Thanks for watching! The Shining was suggested by my patrons over

 again. In the last few weeks the tabloids and conspiracy theorists have been busy
 with yet another dire prediction that Nirbiru aka Planet X or Planet nine will trigger
 earthquakes, floods and generally the end of the world. This time it was meant to
 be on November 19th but as you can see we're all still here.
 The problem here is that Planet X, Planet 9 and Nibiru are often used to
 describe the same phenomena of the thoroughly debunked theory first put
 forward by Nancy Lieder in 1995 that a planet-sized object which she called
 Planet X and about four times the size of the earth on a highly elliptical
 orbit would pass close by to the earth in 2003 and its gravitational effects
 would effectively destroy the earth. This theory has been respun to try and fit
 the end of the last cycle in the Mayan calendar in 2012 and more recently to
 biblical passages with its effects said to occur on the 23rd of September 2017
 and then November 19th 2017. The mysterious Nibiru which has never been
 seen by any serious astronomers, NASA or ESA
 let alone had its orbits plotted has also mutated from a physics defying
 planet to now a brown dwarf just beyond the edge of our solar system. Again
 nothing has ever been seen and more importantly no gravitational effects
 noted that match its description. If it were to be that close to the earth we
 would all see it in the sky and not in some dodgy photographic anomalies or
 30-year old satellite data. But the term Planet X is a real one and was first
 used by the astronomer Percival Lowell in 1906 to describe what was thought to
 be a missing planet which was causing irregularities seen in the orbits of
 Uranus and Neptune. Lowell proposed that the missing planet would be about seven
 times the mass of the earth and about 43 AU or six point four billion kilometres
 from sun. Although Lowell searched in vain until his death in 1916 he never found his planet X. The search for a missing planet
 resumed in 1929 when 22 year-old Clyde Tombaugh joined Lowell Observatory
 Tombaugh's job was to photograph sections of a night sky taking two images of the
 same area two weeks apart and then using a blink comparator he was able to see if
 there was any difference between them. This would show up any objects such as a planet as a moving object against the star background. After looking at about
 two million stars over one and a half years Tombaugh saw a moving object not
 far from the location where Lowell had predicted it should be. This new planet
 was called Pluto and the search for Planet X was over, or so they thought.
 Barely a month had passed since Pluto was discovered when further observations cast doubt on Pluto being Planet X. Firstly there was no visible disc that
 would been expected when looking at a planet, secondly it was very dark it was
 more like a distant star than a planet something that was rather strange for an
 object that should be large enough to affect the orbits of Uranus and Neptune,
 this meant that it was either a darkest planet yet discovered or it was very
 small and thirdly it had an elliptical orbit slightly inclined against the
 solar plane much more like that of a comet or an asteroid. Over the next
 almost fifty years further observations and calculations downgraded Pluto's mass 
 from seven times that of the earth which Lowell had assumed, to around north 0.1
 times that of the earth. By 1978 astronomer James W. Christie observed
 Pluto's moon Charon. By measuring Charon's orbit around Pluto it was
 possible to accurately work out that Pluto was about 1/500th of mass of
 the earth, far too small to be Planet X. When Voyager 2 visited Neptune in 1989
 the measurements it sent back showed that Neptune was smaller in mass than 
 was first thought when. JPL reran the ephemeris calculations on the orbits of
 Uranus and Neptune with the new data the earlier discrepancies disappeared along
 with the need for a Planet X to account for them. Even just after Pluto's
 discovery in the 1930s there were calls from some astronomers but it should not
 be called a planet, it was just too small and in 2006 it was officially downgraded to
 a dwarf planet. By 2014 there have been six other objects of similar size to
 Pluto found in the Kuiper belt, the ring of mostly frozen debris leftover from
 the formation of the solar system. It was the discovery that some of these large
 bodies known as TNO's or Trans-Neptunian Objects had rather
 strange orbits. When looked at as a whole nearly all of them had their orbits
 clustered in one direction rather than being spread out as would be expected. By 2016, 7 more TNO's had been discovered again with most of them having similarly
 offset orbits but that's not the only odd thing in the solar system. In fact
 there were several more unexplained peculiarities, the first of these is
 obviously the orbits clustering of the TNO's, then there was the fact that the
 orbits of these and some other objects were out of a plane of a solar system by
 some way and some were even orbiting in the opposite direction of the rest of
 the planets. Also it's an odd fact that the plane of all the major planets is
 tilted about 6 degrees from the equator of the Sun when you would expect it to
 be the same. But if we put a new large but as yet undiscovered planet into the
 computer models these peculiarities can be explained quite easily.
 Astronomers have nicknamed it Planet 9 and say it it will have a mass of
 around 10 times that of the earth and be about four times larger. It would be on a
 very large elliptical orbit out of a plane of the solar system taking about
 20,000 years to complete one orbit. This would also explain why we haven't yet
 found it we've been looking in the wrong place and it could be up to 1,200 AU or
 180 billion kilometres away at its farthest distance. It's
 computer-simulated orbit would bring it into about 200 AU or 30 billion
 kilometers at its closest approach still well out from the orbit of Neptune and a
 very, very, very long way from the inner solar system on earth. We've also
 recently been able to detect the solar systems around other stars and the most
 common exoplanets found are ones which match the size and mass of a missing
 planet 9 making our solar system look rather odd as we don't appear to have
 one. Theories are that the missing Planet 9 is most likely to be an ice giant
 similar to Neptune that was thrown out of the solar system's plane by Jupiter
 or Saturn or it could possibly be a planet captured from another star in the sun's birth cluster shortly after the
 formation of the solar system. Until it is visually confirmed these will remain
 just theories but it would plug a lot of holes in our current understanding of a
 solar system and reinstate a new planet into Pluto's place. It also unfortunately
 gives plenty of ideas to the Nibiru believers to conflate these pieces of
 information and come up with more wacko end the world theories, so the quicker
 it is found the better it will be for all of us. So thanks for watching and I

right it would move a little bit but we usually usually ignore that you know the earth makes the Sun move a little bit but it's so small we can ignore it the moon makes the earth kind of wobble around two point three quarters of the way from the center of the earth we usually don't account for that when we're looking at satellite motion well instead of just letting go of one what if I give it a sideways push now it orbits now it's losing energy which wouldn't happen in the solar system right not noticeably there's some perturbations from other planets and things but this one does lose energy and spirals in if I don't push it as hard it will do the lips when you study the solar system all the planets are going around the Sun the same way why is that did God decide the only life clockwise or as I'm whether he's above or below the solar system right why is everything going in the same direction well the answer is it wasn't different directions but there was a preferred direction the distant form from had a slight preference one way versus another and things go in the opposite way got eliminated and when it's all said and done everything is going the same way that usually that works 90% of the time and so I had slightly more in one hand and another but I don't consciously do that and you want to give them something spread out a little yeah the wrong way get eliminated right now there also would have been you know this is where this analogy breaks down there's you know another dimension right but those things are out of the plane also that weren't near the preferred plane also got eliminated and so that's kind of cool now my students use a pH et Phet simulation called my solar system and so they've seen all this on the computer and when we do this during our special relativity unit they're like he is just like the computer that's kind of cool that a stretch see the Micra model sings suicide just like it learn to the computer now some things we've discovered using this I'll say it's just some larger marbles my friends with them out but they've been space time too right and so maybe you can get one thing so the earth-moon system maybe and so you see that this seemed you know you can't buy micro this big you get it in rolls and you have to sew it together I've been told to use a stretchy string the stretchy thread to sew it together and so the next time I do it I'll do that because it pulls and so you just a little bit of thread fixes it and so in the morning when I first set this up look at leaning against the table will be underneath fixing holes from last year one time my principal walked in and I hear somebody in the room and I'm underneath on the middle sewing in a little paws yet and then he's looking around for me and he kind of knows some of these in the room buddies oh there you are because what are you doing there and I go I'm repairing a rip in the fabric of space-time you've probably seen plastic ones of these right the Discovery Center Children's Discovery Museum in San Jose has won the Exploratorium has won sometimes they have MIT's shopping malls you put money in it but one thing you can't do with those is put two masses in and so when we went to the moon when we first started we set our spaceship so I'm going to call free return trajectory x' so they would go to the moon and this is hard to get down and they would come back and like a figure eight and so that lets you show now of course the moon is smaller but if you look at the plots of the free return trajectory back from the Apollo program you'll see it has a figure eight sort of shape and so this takes a little bit of practice to be able to do the figure eight these clamps around here you can adjust it to make it tighter if it's not working so Steve and I when we set this up in the morning we played around with it and actually I think it was working better than usually is it's so not easy and so I go through that's one year a kid who read some stuff about the dark energy energy have extra oh and so I'm just energy what does that makes everything come apart right and so dark energy would be that stuff goes apart rather than toward it so if you work in dark energy anytime right and so I go through that spiel maybe it takes me ten fifteen minutes talking with the kids you stuff they're not familiar with and then I just let them play and so that's where we discovered the earth-moon thing is I just let it play and they're like mr. Barth career-low and they're all excited cos they discovered that so so if you want to try it out what we do but we want to play mr. burns so I see the whole thing if you buy all the parts and everything is about a hundred dollars but one of my favorite days so you're gonna do it Monday right Steve don't do it but just do it once and you'll be hooked it will take a little bit of cooling to put it together but I'll post the plans it takes it comes apart all the PVC pipe wrap it with a bungee cord stuff the biker in that box and I can carry the whole thing myself this is about the right size you can get your whole class around it pretty much smaller what one problem is reaching some of you I think would have trouble with that so you get a student to do it right one thing you got to watch though is some students will think to go underneath to push up and then while they're underneath somebody decides to put the big mass out and you know they get their space-time warped and so just tell me can't go under and so is general relativity in the state standards no probably the the crowning achievement of science not in the state standards can you fit it in after the star test you bet you can find some videos like you know I show a thing on gravity waves and then we do this and that's you know a day almost a day but since I don't understand it myself that's plenty so let's go back into the room
moonlanding,"A millennial marketing conference asked me to give a talk on how to market to millennials. The thesis of the talk I gave: Millennials don't exist and the entire idea of ""generations"" is unscientific, condescending, and stupid. For more misconception destruction, check out my show ADAM RUINS EVERYTHING on TruTV!

UPDATE: Since making this video, I've met Jean Twenge, who let me know that she felt I had misunderstood (and thus misrepresented) some of her research. I'm always eager to hear from an expert - which Jean genuinely is on this topic - so we sat down for a special episode of the Adam Ruins Everything podcast to talk about Jean's research on generations and my reservations about the term. Enjoy! http://www.maximumfun.org/adam-ruins-everything/adam-ruins-everything-episode-28-jean-twenge-and-adam-discuss-their-difference

UPDATE 2: Here is Jean Twenge's response to this piece: https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/our-changing-culture/201706/adam-ruined-my-research",Millennials Don't Exist! Adam Conover at Deep Shift,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HFwok9SlQQ,0,3436759,72891,1941,5697,-HFwok9SlQQ,"We have Adam Conover from TruTV's 'Adam Ruins Everything'. Adam joined College Humor in 2012 as a staff writer and a cast member of College Humor Original. He's also the creator and star of the new TruTV series 'Adam Ruins Everything', which is based on the College Humor Original series of the same name. In addition to writing College Humor originals such as 'Mitt Romney Style', he has appeared in videos for the site's 'Hardly Working' series. Prior to joining College Humor, he was an instructor and performer at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York City. He is a stand-up comedian who performs nightly around LA, and he hosts his weekly comedy show 'Fresh Out' at UCB Sunset. Please welcome Adam Conover. Adam: Oh my God, woah, thank you! Thank you for having me. Hello everybody! Hi there! How's it going, are you guys enjoying the conference so far? Are you having a good time? Good. Sorry, I'm trying to do this like a comedy show 'cause that's what I know how to do. Start by dropping my water every time, um, yeah. My name is Adam Conover, I host the show 'Adam Ruins Everything'. Why am I here speaking at this event? I'm not entirely sure. I am a comedian. If you're watching this, getting the sense that ""Wait a second, this guy's talking about marketing and generations and Millennials and he doesn't know what he's talking about, this is just some dumb comedian's take on the issue"", that's exactly what it is. That's exactly what I'm going to present to you, but that's what they asked me to give. What I was told was that my show is very popular with Millennials, it's based on a web series that was also very popular with Millennials. So maybe I have some insight on how to appeal to Millennials, and I do, but it's not what you might expect because my show is, if you haven't seen it, what it is is it's an educational comedy show in which I dispel common misconceptions about the world in which we live. I puncture your widely-held beliefs that you would rather not have disrupted. We talk about issues like engagement rings are a marketing scam, that's true. They were invented by the De Beers diamond corporation in the 1930s as a way to sell more diamonds. Diamonds are also virtually worthless, as we talk about in that video. The TSA does nothing to prevent terrorist attacks. We're taking our shoes off for no reason, it creates the illusion of security without actually making us more secure. And the hymen doesn't work anything the way you think it does... ...guys in the audience, and also many women, don't know our cultural idea of the hymen is totally at odds with the reality. I won't get into the details. It gets a little biological, but you can watch the episode later. And we back up all of the jokes I make on the show with research and we have a research team that does it for us. So these are the sorts of topics we do, right? So it wouldn't be very on-brand of me... Did I use that right? Okay, good, marketing people... ...if I didn't 'disrupt' this conference by telling you the following: Millennials don't exist. That's right, this is 'Adam Ruins Millennials'. That's the segment we're doing today Now, I'm being a little bit glib when I say that, right? I don't mean that literally 20-year olds don't exist, because if they didn't, who would make our coffee at Starbucks? Babies? I don't know. Those are the only people who would accept those wages, I think, other than 20-year olds. But what I mean more specifically is that this image of a Millennial - this is the current cultural image of the Millennial that we see in the media, right? The lazy, entitled narcissist who lives with their parents, takes photos of herself on her phone, right? This person does not exist. I mean, this literal woman exists, right, but she's modelling for Time Magazine. This is a stereotype. This Millennial also does not exist, and neither does this one. I know a lot of 20-year olds. Not a lot of them stand in front of hand-drawn graffiti of social media jargon, you know? They're not like, ""oh man, I love walls! My favourite thing is walls!"" You know, they use Facebook but they don't really like it, you know what I mean? They're not like, ""Ooh, 'social', that's my lifestyle! Right?"" It's not real. And so, if you try to market to this image, you will end up completely alienating your audience because Millennials hate this shit! They hate it! They can't stand it. And the fact is, generations in general don't exist. They're not real things that exist in nature. We made them up, okay? Let's look at the chart of the classic Millennial breakdown. Everyone from 1980 on is a Millennial, '60s to '80s, that's Gen X, '40 to '60, that's Boomers, '20s to '40s, that's the ""Silent"" Generation... I actually hadn't heard of them before I read this chart.. ... I guess they don't talk about themselves that much. And then we have the ""Greatest Generation"", which, speaking of narcissism, my god! The ""Greatest Generation"". Alright. Fine, great, terrific. So now, the horizontal line going up and down, that's based on data. That's the number of people who are alive, who are born in a particular year, right now. This is how it breaks down according to birth year, right? So that's based on real data. The vertical lines, though, those are just sort of slotted in there. Those don't correspond to anything specifically in demographics, you know what I mean? It's not as though every Boomer gave birth to a Gen Xer, gave birth to a Millennial. This is just like an artificial way to divide it up. There are Boomers whose kids are also Boomers, and there are Millennials who have kids who are Millennials. Imagine that right now. There are Millennials with little baby Millennials. It's bizarre. If you look at the demographics, here's what really exists: People! This is an actual generational breakdown, we just got a whole lot of people who are alive at the same time And there's different amounts... varying amounts of them, right? That's what actually exists. A-and the census department themselves say we do not define generations The census bureau does not define generations, right? So, now the thing is generations, right, they are a convenient lens through which we look at the people and the question is how explanatory, how useful is the particular lens we're using, right? So...and you can do it any way that you want And the thing is that the categories that we use tend to reveal our own prejudices and opinions about the people we're describing And so you have to ask yourself: is the description we're using actually helping us to learn or do anything at all, right? So first we might say people born in the early twenties that those are the people that grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression and all that poverty and want and that probably shaped their lives and the way they look at the world Correct, right? I would agree with that but equally true about them is that they're also the generation that enjoys jazz clarinet music Right? It's equally true about them, a lot less useful of a fact, right? People born in the late eighties, you might say, ""Oh, there's the people who grew up with MTV"" That's the MTV generation. They grew up with music videos.. ..you know, fast movie media, stuff like that. Also true, you might also say, ""Well, this is the generation that saw Janet Jackson's nickel...nipple at the Superbowl Also true, less explanato...now I know you're going to say a lot of people saw her nipple Those were the people who were okay with seeing her nipple They were like, we're happy to see the nipple, it's fine. Why is everyone making such a big deal about it, right? This is how we divide it up, like We can divide up these people however we want. How useful is the divisions that we're using, right? So where do our actual divisions come from? Where do the generations that we talk about, you know, where does the idea of millenials, boomers, where are those big ones Where did those come from? The fact is writers invent them to get rich Generation X was coined by Douglas Coupland. He was a novelist in the early 90s He wrote this book...Generation X was a huge bestseller. You can see up in the top there ""The book that defined an era"" It was very successful for him. He got on the cover of Time magazine And after that, it was like a gold rush Who can name the next generation?! Who's gonna get the name that sticks And as we all remember, there were like dozens of names tossed out there that are just like, you know Rose and fell. There was echo boomers. Remember that one? Sixty minutes apparently was pushing echo boomers with a flip phone, I guess, represented...millenials to them Very clearly a show made by old people Echo Boomers, I guess, because they were echoing the pre..,like the baby boomers, something, whatever The net generation, okay, that's pretty good. The generation that grew up with the internet Maybe we could get some value out of that There was generation Y, as in ""WHY?"" wasn't the person who came up with this more creative? It was great, but the winners of the big generational jackpot Were these guys, Neil Howe and William Strauss. Who coined the term ""Millennials""... ... That was the term that stuck, right? Here them describing that on TV, and also they coined the term, so they got to pick, what they thought differentiated the generation from the ones before, right? So here's there pitch Strauss: Today with the emergent of yet a new generation Babies are to be protected... Howe: And we call them the ""Millennial Generation."" Conover: Ok, Millennials babies are protected, right? We protect millennials, right? As opposed to previous generations who are just allowed to like, play in open mine shafts... ... and with TNT, right? That's why they were called ""Baby Boomers"", cause they were always exploding. That's the best joke in the presentation... ...But, look, these guys did it! These guys have made a ton of money! I believe they're millionaires, because they coined the term ""Millennials"" They founded a firm called LifeCourse Associates which use a visionary blend of social science and history. To interpret the qualitative nature of a generations collective persona To help managers, and marketers leverage quatitative... ... They take a lot of money to do a lot of nothing. In my opinion, that's what they do. I sounded like Donald Trump for a second right there.. .. And they consult for huge firms like, Best Buy, Merrill Lynch, the NRA, and the Coast Guard. And they are very successful, because I know a lot of millennials who are like ""Oh yeah! Merrill Lynch is totes on fleek! You know? The Coast Guard is bae, right? Worked out great for them. It's fantastic. Here's the fact generational thinking.. Talking about generations this way, has always been historically reductive and condescending To the people who are being described. The first person to talk about generations was ""Hesiod"" He was histories first economist, he was an ancient Greek economist."
moonlanding,"Even the most daunting world records are meant to be broken… eventually. For elite navigator Stan Honey and a crew of sailing all-stars, beating the prestigious monohull transatlantic sailing record was the ultimate accomplishment. And it was no easy feat. On July 22, 2016, the Comanche—a custom-built, 100-foot racing yacht—set sail from New York to the southern tip of England. Precisely five days, 14 hours, 21 minutes and 25 seconds later, the Comanche’s crew shattered the world record … by more than a day. Brave the high seas as we set sail on one of the most amazing and inspiring journeys ever to take place on film.

A boat so light, so fast, that it would shatter
 every record it attempted. In 2014... That dream became a reality, with 100-foot monohull, Comanche. the fastest monohull in the world. she has since been dominating the world of professional sailing, blowing competitors out of the water. Now, skipper Ken Read is on a mission to break one of sailing's
 most prestigious benchmarks, the transatlantic record. - It's one of the holy grails
 of ocean-going records. from New York to the
 southern tip of England. The crew's success depends largely on how elite navigator, Stan Honey, can predict, harness, and adapt to the Atlantic's
 fickle weather patterns. If broken, this record will
 secure Comanche's place among the most successful
 racing boats in sailing history. (slow mysterious chiming) - Overview of Comanche is really simple. It’s, uh, Jim and Kristy Clark's dream to have the ultimate race boat, the
 ultimate monohull race boat. of the modern monohull,
 then set out to build the next iteration of racing boats, principally designed to
 break open ocean records. are the best of the best. - There was no expense spared
 in creating this thing. It's either carbon or titanium. - With the engineering structure, with the use of carbon fiber, with this canting keel mechanism, this boat is literally half the weight of a boat like this,
 even 10, 15 years ago. - Ken Read, the skipper,
 and Jim Clark, the owner, gave the designer a
 very, very clear mission, which was to design and build
 the fastest possible boat that was legal to enter into the major ocean races around the world, and to, ideally, set the course
 records for these events. That sort of clarity of
 objective was, I think, critical to the boat coming out the way it did. - You know, it's meant to make a statement in the sailing world,
 and you can just tell by its outward appearance, it
 makes a statement. (laughs) - The level of detail that they
 take in building these boats then filters down throughout
 the whole sailing team. - Ken is among the best
 sailors in the world. He's a commentator for the America's Cup, he's extremely
 knowledgeable, you know, about sailing, and he's a great skipper. - Ultimately, what I'm
 pretty good at doin' is getting a compatible group of all-stars from all around the globe, that can actually handle a boat like this. It's like a Formula One car: You let it get away from
 you, it'll get away from you. - It is a very dangerous boat. Everybody who is onboard this boat either has America's
 Cup, Volvo Ocean Race, Grand Prix high-end racing background. It's their career; it's their job. - My job, specifically,
 is really quite easy: I get to sail the coolest
 boat in the world. I guess, as the skipper of the boat, I'm ultimately responsible
 for the safety of the crew, the big decisions, you know? I work very closely with
 Stan Honey, the navigator, on where we position
 ourselves in the ocean. It's critical, because the
 navigator and the skipper work together very closely. And then where we overlap
 and work together, is in the tactic area. - The boat's a 100-foot screamin' machine, that has been built to break
 every record in the world that we can, and she's
 on her way to doing that. Comanche went straight
 for her competitors. - Wild Oats is the boat to knock off, and we're here for a
 reason, but there's also three or four other really
 good boats in this event, that could do the same exact thing, so we've just gotta go out and sail well, and let the chips fall. to any other boat out there at the moment. (crowd cheering) - I think it's fair to say, we've got the fastest
 100-footer in the world. You saw what it did off the starting line and what it did down that first run, and we were 30 miles ahead when we broke. We love this boat. and setting the records. - This boat's unique, because it's the fastest
 in the world. (laughs) set their sights on sailing's
 most prestigious prize, the transatlantic record. - Stan Honey is a legend in our sport. When you think of all
 the great navigators, Stan is one of those guys right at the top of the list who comes to mind. The amount of work that he puts into it, to make these attempts happen, without him, it wouldn't happen. - So, uh, the transatlantic monohull record is probably the most prestigious
 sailing record of any. was first set by the schooner, Atlantic. It took her 12 days and
 four hours to cross, a benchmark that stood for 100 years. Since then, only four boats
 have improved on her record. is to try to set the monohull record for the fastest transatlantic passage. That record is currently set at six days, 17 hours, by Mari-Cha. - Mari-Cha did as well
 as any boat could do in that tactic, where you're
 gonna have to use two systems to get across the ocean. So what we were trying to do was to take an entirely
 different approach, which nobody had ever
 done before in a monohull, but take a single system
 all the way across. - You know, he watches the weather,
 just religiously, looking for all these small little things that might happen. - I had access to 11 years
 of historical weather data, so I routed Comanche every six hours for each of the last 11 years,
 from June through November, and what I discovered was that there was only two
 possibilities per year, on average, where Comanche could stay
 ahead of a southwesterly storm the whole way across. - You can't take the ocean for granted. This is man against ocean, this
 is man against the elements. If I've learned anything,
 you start to just get a little cocky in the
 ocean and it'll bite you, hard. Stan Honey spots a moving
 low in the westerlies, potentially favorable
 for an Atlantic crossing. Within a day, the
 international Comanche team is assembled in New York City,
 waiting for a green light. - It was kind of a cruel turn of fate that it turned out that the
 perfect weather had evolved at a time when Kenny couldn't join us. - For Ken, it just came at a period where he had a prior commitment
 with the America's Cup, but that's the nature of weather. Captain Casey Smith will
 take the helm as skipper. - I’ll (expletive) my pants to start with. (laughs) - But at that point, Kenny
 knew just how hard it is to find these opportunities, and said, ""Okay, well, I can't make
 it, but you guys gotta go."" - To be able to be told that, ""Hey, you're gonna be the guy in charge,"" and I was really, really
 happy to be in that position and trusted like that. - Casey is an enormously
 experienced sailor, and he was the boat
 captain, so he's the guy in charge of moving the
 boat around between events, so nobody knows the
 boat better than Casey. - Casey in the pit, Nick Dana at the rig. - The transatlantic was a
 very interesting one for us, because we had three false starts. You're waiting for that exact window and you have to be ready at any moment, so your life's pretty much on hold. At this point, we're not that confident that this was actually, the one. - We are getting constant
 information from Stan. - We wanna start as close
 as we can to the front, but ahead of the thunderstorms, because if the thunderstorms catch us, you guys know what happens. where you're waitin'
 for that exact window, and you have to be ready at any moment. put yourself in harm's
 way to try to do something that nobody else has ever done before. and started motoring out,
 that's when it really was like, ""Wow, we're doin' it, we're gonna go!"" Amazing. (tense music) - It's real, it's happening. We positioned ourselves about a mile away from the Ambrose Light,
 which gives us enough runway to hit the start line at full speed. We had the sail combination
 that we wanted to use, we had the perfect wind,
 it was time to let it rip. - Honey! Oh, this is perfect, guys. can often put you on your butt. - Copy, 16:58.16. - And we came past the
 Ambrose Light fully lit up. Everyone gave a huge hoot and holler as we went past the start
 line, and off we went. (wake hissing) (dramatic drum-heavy music) And, it's pretty radical. You've got all the sail area up, you've got all the power
 in the world you need, so, you know, for a start,
 you don't want to mess it up. (wake hissing)
 (dramatic music) - New York's there, England
 is there, 3,100 miles now. We're gonna knock this bastard off. (thunder rumbles)
 (wake hisses) things take a dangerous turn, as Comanche tangles with a
 formidable thunder storm. - The worst part of it, the most dangerous part, weather-wise, was actually the first
 night and that next morning. - We started ahead of a front, and the thunder storms preceding the front came out earlier than expected, and kinda gobbled us up,
 which was unexpected, and you know, we definitely
 had to change our plan, adapt on the go, sail a course that we
 weren't expecting to sail, and the first thing in my mind is, ""Is it over? ""Are we done? ""Are we sailing home and
 going on standby again?"" through the wind and waves of the unforeseen lightning squall. - You know, you can't
 control the lightning. The lightning does what it wants to do, and so you basically just
 put that out of your mind and focus on the sailing. You focus on what you can control. - I thought it was over. When the thunderstorms came, I
 thought it was actually over. But luckily, we were able to find a little narrow bit of
 breeze, up close to land, and escaped. - And we managed to just
 wiggle our way out of it and, uh, keep on going. - Well, tough morning, day two. The thunder storms, which were brewed up over the Central America, came out and got us. Now we've popped out the other side, and we're back in the forecast winds. - So we're heading east at pace. - It's probably closer
 to a dive expedition. We spend a lot of time underwater. All of our gear is our
 only line of defense from becoming totally saturated, turning into a giant raisin. - You've got 18 guys onboard, and it's for 5-1/2 days, so it's pretty tight quarters, even though it is a 100-foot boat. You're sharing bunks, sharing bowls, you're sharing water bottles for drinking and everything. - This race we just did a
 simple four-on, four-off, you know, traditional watch system. waking up every four hours to come on deck and do your watch. - No, you're off the lock! You might sleep for
 three hours out of that when you're down, when you've eaten. but you never miss your
 four hours on deck. - When you're off watch, you
 gotta do everything else. That's when you gotta do the cooking, do the tidying up, do the eating, and try to get some sleep. The four hours goes by pretty darn quick. - So, you have your helmsmen, who are... They'll drive the boat for two hours. You've got your trimmers of the sails, who are basically the engine,
 making the boat go fast. - So I'm one of the bright individuals that is on the front of the boat, that's basically taking on a lot of the dangerous situations. Up front, we deal with all
 the sails going up and down. who are required for the
 muscles and everything, to pull those sails in. - The more prestigious of the records are set by boats where
 all of the sail handling is done with human power. - We have six grinding pedestals, so we have to pull any
 sails up or trim them in. We have 12 guys just going at it, until, you know, the trimmer's
 happy or, you know, the sail's up. you're steering, you're always sort of losing, losing, losing, losing against the, the sleep. even though, it's a terrible
 place in a lot of respects. - Oh, I wish I had new boots. (laughs) (wake hissing)
 (crew chatting) - Being onboard Comanche in the
 middle of the Atlantic Ocean is something that, you realize
 how small you are out there. You realize that you're a speck. Personally, I love the silence. You know, when you're
 flying an airplane across and you look down, you're
 never gonna see us. It's huge. You know, if we were to lose all
 communications and everything, you'll have a hard time finding us. - Another thing that you
 tend to notice early on is how big the ocean is. You know, if you're sailing around the world, you can just sail for day,
 after day, after day, after day, even on a really fast boat. - You have a lot of time to
 think, when you're out there. The day slows down a lot. You're living every hour. (water splashing) - It's kinda cool to just disconnect, and you're out there, in the elements, the wind and the waves... It's nothing like it, it's crazy. - You have a lot of time to reflect on everything in your life, but as well, you have a lot of time to appreciate where you are in the world. All of us were definitely captivated by
 the sea at that point. - It's amazing. - You get the clouds getting
 lower, and lower, and lower, and the sky turns more and more gray, and then you get this sort of
 drizzle, as it starts to rain, and that's what we had, all
 the way across the ocean. Just kind of this gray drizzle. - Things move differently compared to other keeled
 boats I've sailed on. One minute you're doing 10 miles an hour, and then you blink, and honestly, you're up to 20 to 30 miles an hour. - The thing's a weapon. It just goes forever, and it's
 not a really short awesome, but things being awesome for days on end. (tense music) - Okay, guys, there's ice
 contours we're keeping track of. Comanche faces its greatest obstacle, navigating through an area
 known to have icebergs. - There was a very small
 patch of south-westerly that we had to stay in,
 and that patch of wind took us right through an area where there was known to be ice. (tense throbbing music) - Couldn't see more than 100-feet in front of the boat. Fully engulfed in fog. You know, doing 20 knots, 100-feet isn't enough
 warning to avoid the ice. - And it sounds crazy, to have guys on deck keeping
 a careful watch for icebergs when you can't even see the bow, but a funny thing happens when
 you get close to an iceberg. The icebergs are just unbelievably white that they appear to glow. You know, you're sailing along and the pea soup fog suddenly gets a little bit clearer, and then a part of the
 horizon looks funny, 'cause it looks like it's glowing. - The consequence of hitting icebergs is so severe and it's like you just turn it out of your mind. We just can’t. You prepare for it, but
 if it happens, it happens. - On the leeward side of an iceberg, you can get these small
 bits of ice called growlers. They're too small to see on radar. You know, they're like the
 size of a pick-up truck. If it hit the boat exactly wrong, it's potential, that it
 could punch a big enough hole into the boat, so that
 the boat could sink. - To be fair, it's hard to sleep when you're off watch and go down below, because you know the other
 watch is going through exactly the same thing, so
 it's a little bit nervous. Not my favorite part of sailing. I don't like it, yeah. - That's why, when we sleep down below, we sleep with our feet forward, so if you stop suddenly,
 your feet'll take the impact, not your head. - Hey guys, we're out of the area that there are known to be icebergs, and we've got 20 minutes
 till we're out of the area where there's any
 possibility of an iceberg. - Yeah, right now, by the GPS we're at 22 miles, a
 little over an hour to go. - We knew we were on the pace. We knew that the time was right. (winches ticking) - And a lot of transatlantic records fail right at the finish. Boats get within a hundred
 mile of the finish, and then they stop, due to the light air. And I knew, once we were
 2/3 of the way across, that that wasn't gonna happen, that that low was powerful
 enough to push that ridge and we were gonna have
 good breeze all the way in. - Land, yeah. We're looking for the Lizard. Should be on the bow, about 10 miles, can't quite see it yet. - And the finish is off
 the Lizard Lighthouse in southwest England. - Now!
 (cheering) (speaking in foreign language) - Essentially, we had crushed the record. - The goal was to improve
 Mari-Cha's record by a day. We were able to improve it
 by one day, three hours. We pioneered a completely new tactic, which is the tactic of
 doing it in a single system. And it was just barely possible to do that with a boat like Comanche,
 and I don't think it would have been possible with a monohull that was any slower. - This boat was built to do that. It did it. We're all very happy. - It's such a special thing, to be able to break this
 transatlantic record. Huge thanks to the weather gods to allow us to do it, as well, 'cause that what it really took. - I'm happy, I'm tired! (laughs) - I think, for everyone in the crew it was something they're real proud of, because these records live forever. - A record like the transatlantic record is one of the most prestigious
 events in all of sailing. Even if somebody beats our record, it'll always show that Comanche
 took one day, three hours off the previous one. (laid-back synthesized music) (fireworks whistling and cracking)"
moonlanding,"The Warriors Superteam was completed when Kevin Durant signed as a free Agent in 2016. However, the Warriors core of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green took years to assemble. This video details the rough times that happened beforehand and all the major events that led to the Warriors becoming one of the greatest teams of all time.

http://www.youtube.com/user/CHUKImusic",Timeline of How the Warriors Built a Superteam,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7w3d-h_QYnI,0,3820232,37387,1548,3776,7w3d-h_QYnI,final seconds here this 2018 NBA season there's the buzzer face a new dynasty in the NBA the Golden State Warriors champions once again back-to-back titles three in four years and the latest will have sweet Latrell Sprewell is on suspension for attacking Golden State Warriors coach PJ Carlesimo his coaching style does not mean that somebody has a right to choke him right now which right there did you say I think it's a good question about this this a real good question some like I said it like I said early life will be determined with a lot we don't know by Charlotte sighs she'll fall away mr. poor fundamentals though by the Warriors find your man and put a body on it first then go get the ball I want to thank our warrior fans for their commitment and passion to this organization they deserve better than what we've been able to deliver over the course of the last several seasons and we are committed to to doing whatever it takes to win with the seventh pick in the 2009 NBA Draft the Golden State Warriors select Stephon curry from Davidson College you were talking about playing alongside Stefan curry it's tough and maybe a little more difficult if both of your on the floor right now and maybe even right now him being a rookie it takes time to learn how to play this game everybody knows the business so every year another flare come into your position the disgruntled Jackson one of the major links to the team's last playoff run became disenchanted with the makeup of the team and have been trying to orchestrate a trade since midsummer Jackson had said quote I'm just looking to go somewhere where I can go win a championship and he begs at home over him curry has saved his best for last 42 points with the sixth pick in the 2010 draft NBA Draft the Golden State Warriors select f8u though from Baylor University well it's been a long time since the Warriors had an all-star and they acquire one today in David Lee the power forward and a sign-and-trade from the New York Knicks I think we have a chance to do some special things and like I said a good young chord that can grow together so they think it turns into a great situation Peter and I just want to thank all of you for the opportunity you run this franchise going forward if you look up there that is a very lonely flag we want another one Epis completely and it's it's kind of nice to be able to get somebody with more than just one skill and not a lot of these guys have more than one but some are just specialists or they're either outstanding shooters your outstanding rebounders nuther 20-point shot by Durrell right and that's a franchise record nine fries made tonight breaking news this just in the Sports Center mama there goes that man Golden State has found its man the Warriors announcing tonight mark Jackson will take over as head coach by the bay it's Jackson's first head coaching gig in the NBA with the 11th pick in the 2011 NBA Draft the Golden State Warriors select klay Thompson from Washington State University Monta Ellis Steph Curry backcourt that experiment it just didn't work and so I like the I like the balance of the roster a little bit more curry if he's healthy klay Thompson the rookie getting more minutes and then Lee and Bogut up front I like it I love the action parker has six assists already tonight to go with his nine points timeout Golden State the Warriors have promoted Bob Meyers to be their new general manager Larry Riley will remain with the team as the director of scouting my love for the NBA started with this team and so for me it's more than just a job it's can't wait to get started four years forty four million that's essentially eleven million a year for a guy with no ankles that's a horrible contract no he played 26 games last year he's still hurt now that's just not something you want from a guy who can do nothing but score his assists aren't that great he can't really rebound but he's gonna be hurt with the seventh pick the Golden State Warriors select Harrison Barnes the 35th pick the Golden State Warriors select draymond Green from Michigan State University I should think the stuff is a tweener because he shoots a lot for a point guard he gave up more than he gave I want a guy who can I need a stopper at my point I can't let my point guard give up 42 points but I just thank you guys obviously the end the way we wanted to but all the hard work and the foundation we built this year we're gonna keep getting growing and keep getting back to to this level next year despite losing Carl Landry and Jared Jack the Warriors did sign a very impressive player in Andre Iguodala and they were in the race for Dwight Howard though I think you know last playoff run really good a big build job for them and I when I saw Steph's the video when he said it he was to me look like he was joking we gonna win the championship next you know like yeah of course he's confident he's tragically flawed as a basketball player where he's got tissue paper ankles both of them if he can stay healthy he he brought he might be the best point guard a league next year obviously frustrated we fought so hard this whole series this whole season to put ourselves in a position to advance in the playoffs so very very frustrated disappointed miss things right now I have no idea why he was coaching for his life you know they made to play all the one time in 17 years before he got there and he got him to the playoff back-to-back years they and they were not the team that was gonna beat the Clippers the Clippers had a better team but at the first sign of trouble next regular season you know where the criticisms gonna be aimed at the head the new head coach oh no more Mark Jackson new coach Steve Kerr has never coached a dribble in his life Wow he's gonna be on the hot seat pretty quickly there I think if you look at Golden State you know they have fans big plans either did they believe if they're able to get their hands on seven love but they can combine him with Stefan curry and potentially try to offer themselves up and the Warriors found their backup Steph Curry they signed six foot seven guard Shaun Livingston he can play the point shooting guards three-year deal 16 million no lawyers lawyers that is all like jump shooting team I don't think you can win the championship be good team shoot jumpers but they're not even top three in your mind oh but I like the big man on those other three team you want to see a dribble move watch this move double behind your back knock it down and the bench is loving it get it again of you're wondering what the NBA record is for most points in a quarter he had just watched it everybody on the court produced may may plays the guys here before me HB can't say enough about his performance tonight on both ends of the floor it was I think because everybody was kind of enjoying the moment and the dream season is now complete the Golden State Warriors of the 2015 NBA champions their first title in 40 years and how sweet at the speed for those crazy loyal Bay Area fans david lee thankful to have a championship but wanted to go somewhere where he could play more boost his value for next summer when the big money comes in from the TV money and the cap goes up so can you maybe shift your opinion on how you can win a Finals no not really because I still think of Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving out of been half of they would have won that series but I don't think he'd be all of a sudden is gonna I have a bunch of three-point shooters and play on a bunch of small lineups you do have a timeout decide not to use a curry curry with six tenths of a second remaining killing of Stefan Kelly continues and he ties the NBA record with his 12th three-pointer of the game I think Steph Curry just played the greatest single season we have ever seen any NBA player have last night made his 400 and second three-point shot breaking his record by a hundred and 16 set last year that's crazy how we doin still hyped I'm great absolutely got the finals we all want it that is a fact I know I'm much better than Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook are at this moment well who is and that's it correct thank you final seconds it's over it's over Cleveland is a city of Champions once again the Cavaliers are NBA champions what happened to the Golden State Warriors they're up one going to the fourth quarter and they managed a grand total of 13 points at home in Game seven what players set to be free agents in 2016 could get paid big time thanks to the NBA's new multi-billion dollar TV deal the salary cap is expected to spike this is a story that I just don't buy Durant to the Warriors I think there's zero chance it happens in Hollywood and a star driven business in Hollywood you don't want to become the also starring dot-dot-dot this guy breaking news it's here and it's gold in the stage for Kevin Durant I'm about that team think about a 73 win regular season team one win shy of back-to-back NBA titles and they just got the last MVP to win that award not named Steph Curry how are you viewing this move from Durant well I'm doing it as the weakest move I've ever seen from a superstar but the flipside is this they were up 3-1 in the Western Conference Finals three times he failed particularly in Game six and you depart for the team that beat you you're jumping on a bandwagon as far as I'm concerned you know a lot of people complained we sat before the season last year right well how could KD what do you mean you went from Oklahoma City to the team that beat you you can't do that in the super till stuff we talked about but do you think he's he's shutting up people up I mean back-to-back championships back-to-back NBA Finals MVPs I don't know what else he could do to prove that he made the right decision without a one-on-one in Oklahoma City you

Take,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSE91uFPvbc,0,291599,2506,136,628,xSE91uFPvbc,I want to be very very clear by where I stand KD overall because we have some history ourselves I am NOT concerned in the slightest not even a little bit not even a little bit let me be very very clear and this morning reason I had to modify my position I'm on the record we all know this when he left to go to the old estate weakest move I've ever seen by a superstar KD and I talked about the hash that we good but the reason why I called it a weak move was because he's so great that it drastically shifted the balance of power and MBA to a point where there's no competition now obviously I had some person who things going on at the time with my mom and all of that other stuff that was one of the reasons but that year how much fire gamesman five games but what who don't know what's gonna happen just wipe the competition there is no way somebody that great can be on that squad and guess what you got a chance so that's why I said I thought the move was weak then obviously I apologized to the wonderful mama Durant because you know you ain't wanted that's my lady in when my mom passed away she's one of the first people that was there for me I love that woman she is special to me having said all of that I also had a problem with people taking my words and using that to interpret it as weak question than the greatness of Kevin Durant I said no no I'm saying he's so great this is the main competition unfair that was my point so that brings me to where I'm at right now I don't want to hear these lies about he's six nine that man is o-69 not six not okay shorter than a Greek freak this dude got a six a seven six wingspan can pull up from 30 2025 Ted mid-range game long range game he could by the way he could post when he wants to fadeaway shot baseline perimeter wig he don't this tools effectively is so elite he's so elite now if he were a Russell Westbrook or a Derrick Rose or somebody like that it would be different because this success is largely predicated on their athleticism Cady's success is predicated on the fact that he is a marksman he is a marksman and that's how my chicken Achilles injury ain't gonna make them shorter he ain't gonna make him shorter it's not going to strip him of the ability to get off his shot you certainly ain't blocking it most of the time not when he's seven feet not a so he still isn't understand it but what I'm saying to you is he don't have to be about him in the slide what about on defense okay you could say that you know what my response would be are you gonna have him chasing out on the perimeter because you might not have to do that and guess what if you have to chase if he doesn't have to check I agree we don't have to chase people on the perimeter then excuse me it's not gonna be that glare it's not yes it's that it's unlikely he'll it's very likely we've already seen the best of KD that is a sad thing for me because we should have seen at least this much for the next three or four in the contact thank you for not unlike the Warriors where he could you just couldn't lose so you're really not proving anything to me he could have proven some jam I'm making fun of a slump I feel better Oh Tom Brady and I'm not getting all your talk about this to stay with me Oh Tom Brady's gonna fall off a cliff still win the titles and all I'm saying to you is Katie somehow someway the dude that's a career 27 point but gets go I apologize man he might have is 26 instead of 27 huh me that's a buddy I'm not worried the minute okay is he gonna be enough Network at all will he be a peak ended I think yeah thanks nothing so I think you're right I don't think we're back can i play becomes a different factor because we did pros and cons today of each scenario on which he can go to and one of the pros we did about that over there across the East River and Brooklyn was that Katie's always played for himself right like OKC turned into himself where it's narrower Russ would imagine whatever you want to call it Golden State he had to prove something I don't think Katie I think one of the things that lures him a little bit to Brooklyn a little bit is about the culture a basketball man like he's from Prince George Prince George's County right the DMV like there are kids over there that look like him that sound like him like there's a culture movement that could be pushed into this whole said could you talk to me about the potential culture impact he could have if he were with the Knicks instead of this well my thing is how I see this question as a real New Yorker yes because I live in Brooklyn I'll just say this I come into the city sometimes I don't know what Manhattan stands for I agree with you international money all of that stuff but the real problem is the Knicks because remember the net the Mets are in Queens the Yankees are in the Bronx both the Jets and Ajanta in these four other for the New Jersey it's about New York as opposed to one of the borough's but my response to that would be you wouldn't have that question if they had a basketball team I had a basketball where Spike Lee live it's true it's reach you something about New York most people that are from New York we never want to live in the city we want to live in the borough's but we go to the city because that's where the action is what we don't want to live there because that's where the noise is you want that's where the noise and the buzz is you go home for peace and quiet no tensive to live in the city we would know the Brooklyn Nets or more emblematic of New York City than the New York Knicks the Knicks are a Russell in the NASA Brooklyn or a soulless corporate organization that hasn't won anything in 46 years the Nets right now are the rising tide in New York and if KD goes there listen to me is from this from the guy that was standing outside on line go to the upper deck then the cattles when

moonlanding,"This video from the Glenn Research Center highlights in stunning, behind-the-scenes imagery the launches of three space shuttle missions: STS-114, STS-117, and STS-124. NASA engineers provide commentary as footage from the ground and from the orbiters themselves document in detail the first phase of a mission.","""Best of the Best"" Provides New Views, Commentary of Shuttle Launches",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwqZ4qAUkE,0,896107,12534,219,0,vFwqZ4qAUkE,hi i'm matt melis i'm an aerospace engineer for nasa and i worked on the shuttle program for a good number of years and i'm here with my colleague today kevin burke who participated in the acquisition and deployment of uh the 30 or so clips that you're going to see in just a few minutes now um and kevin thanks for being here today glad to be here matt uh what what you're going to see is uh what i consider to be the best of the best state-of-the-art imagery on both film and high definition video that the space shuttle program is capable of producing today and uh not only does it serve a technical purpose um and we'll get into a lot of that detail as we get into the uh the movies here but it also uh serves as an enormous inspirational and educational aspect for for all of nasa's stakeholders there's a number of intents that we have for this production and one of them is to pay tribute and commemorate the shuttle program which has essentially been a 30-year program and it's nearing completion as we go to final print with this production we also want to pay tribute to the men and women that made all of this imagery possible over the years of different missions and launches that we've had and also to give a view that not very many people see outside the nasa family of these fantastic pictures that are used largely for engineering purposes uh and to let everyone on the outside of the nasa family have insight as to to what goes on with the shuttle when it launches i think this is a very moving set of clips that you're about to see we're opening here with this somewhat stylized view of one of the launch sequences that actually is going to play out in the in the upcoming clips and i've got a little soft focus on it and i thought we would open it up with a a couple of fun facts about the shuttle it really is an amazing piece of equipment has phenomenal amount of fuel that it burns over the eight minutes during his trip to orbit and when they get up there in that short eight minutes they're going about five miles a second which is a pretty spectacular achievement for a piece of machinery so uh this is how it all happens this is how the the uh the machine does its job and uh the film speaks volumes this is camera view e19 we commonly refer to this as echo19 and it's a 16 millimeter camera with a 10 millimeter field of view for the lens the focal length of the lens and it's running at 400 frames a second so the effective shutter speed is really one one twelve hundredth of a second yeah that's it's pretty amazing i mean this is all a slow-motion event uh and basically you're going to see the six seconds prior to launch of the vehicle uh as the space shuttle main engines turn on now the purpose of this camera they all have different purposes these most of these uh if not all of these cameras that you're going to see in this production are engineering uh cameras to look for different engineering aspects of of the launch process and so the purpose of this one is to check to make sure ignition is going off okay which is what you're seeing here main engine start is just happening and you can see the engines are starting one at a time uh this particular camera looks at uh engines number one and three right is that what this is yep and um and so you can see them they're starting to fire up uh those sparkers that you see are are there to make sure that any unburned hydrogen gets ignited before it floats around and collects in some place where it can ignite later and cause problems again you're seeing the engines sort of turn on here and so uh we're roughly coming into about five seconds before liftoff the computers are checking and validating that everything's a-okay and uh there's a little bit of a of a pitch over that the whole vehicle does as a consequence of these these engines thrusting off the center of gravity and when the whole vehicle snaps back and is straight up in the air the engines or the boosters ignite and the whole thing takes off great great photography here i mean you can see all this flow phenomenon going on inside the engines now the spatial main engines are burning hydrogen and oxygen and i'll talk about some of the fun facts about that later on in some of the other clips that you're going to see but here you can see the engines have stabilized and uh everything is a-okay and uh in just a few moments you'll see the boosters fire off um did we talk about the time code i can't remember so no we haven't talked about the time code the time code that you'll see the led display on the right-hand side is actually positioned between the two sprockets um on the 16 millimeter frame and uh the time code is utc time code it's an irb format and you'll see that it's uh 21 hours so being utc at a 502 pm local time 2 minutes 11 seconds and the three digits that are moving in the upper right hand corner would be representing a thousandth of a second the solid number one on the second digit from the top is uh indicating the synchronization of the cameras is more of a technical parameter and that is uh on every camera to synchronize the field of view they've synchronized the time this is pretty cool you can see some of the oxygen that that cloud of vapor there was from the oxygen uh fuel umbilical uh of course the solid rocket boosters have now uh ignited their the whole vehicle is lifting off the pad and uh you can see sort of the glory of this moment i mean there's an enormous amount of fuel being burned uh one little thing that i love is if you look at the sky in the background this was a very clear day these pictures were selected or these movies were selected because of the the the wonderful photography that we got in the state and you can see the sky deep into this dark blue and that's because as uh as kevin will talk later on that we got into uh color correction that we do post uh post launch to make sure that we're capturing all of this uh the events that are going on all of the flow events so here the vehicles uh clearing the pad and um we're on our way this view that you're seeing here is uh is camera e8 or echo 8 and it's a 16 millimeter camera with a 10 millimeter lens yeah you can see the booster is now coming off the pad and uh one of the amazing things that a lot of folks don't know about shuttle is bolted to the mobile launch platform is it's basically through four bolts on each solid rocket booster and the intent of these cameras is to watch that bolt which is an explosive uh nut bolt arrangement and the bolt weighs about 100 pounds i should say and these nuts fracture and the bolts uh slap down into a holder that you're actually sort of seeing in the foreground here and they literally release the vehicle from the pad and allow it to uh to take off so for obvious reasons we have a camera on each one of these explosive uh hold down posts and uh to make sure that they're operating uh they're a critical aspect to the launch process we wanna make sure that they're operating good so you can see that puff of smoke coming out and actually if you wanna put the uh remote on a frame by frame uh stop action you can actually see the flash as it explodes now kevin here here's where you guys really did a fantastic job of of capturing the the detail in the plume through this automatic aperture on the cameras you want to talk about that a bit sure uh many of the uh 60 millimeter cameras that are on the mlp and pad structure have a an automatic exposure control it's the only real way to to keep the the exposure the high dynamic range exposure from uh pre-ignition of the srbs uh through through the uh the liftoff out of the frame of view uh so the camera has a basically an automatic exposure right now look at this sky on the left uh thing and see how it gets dark actually on both sides you can see how it turns that deep blue that's the automatic aperture in action right there right allowing us to see the detail in the in the pad structure and also in the flame yeah i mean when you see a launch in real life you the you can't see any detail with the naked eye in the plume it's just like looking into the the sun almost it's so bright we can see some of the water from the launch pad there's a cooling water that comes out we'll talk about that later that's splashing onto this quartz uh protective glass that the camera's behind of course they're in these explosion pool uh containers right to keep the cameras safe and sound that no cameras were harmed in this in the making of this movie that's right the cameras are in an explosion-proof box uh which is nitrogen purged and uh the quartz glass on the front protects the lens in in most cases there are some cases where there's damage and if that's the case the lenses will be re-polished re-ground or or whatever is necessary to bring them back into optimal condition well at this next view coming up is uh echo 18 or camera 18 and it's a 10 millimeter lens uh and looking at the tsm or the tail service mast carrier disconnect yeah the umbilicals uh there's one on each side of the orbiter one for the liquid oxygen fueling and one for the liquid hydrogen fueling those are primary purposes you can see there's a lot of other instrumentation on these things in feed lines but these cameras their intention is to make sure we get good retraction of this and there's actually a huge 20 000 pound mass that pulls these things inside the tail service mast uh for the door to slam shut and protect them from the um the hostile environment on the outside now these umbilicals are about four feet wide by six foot tall so you don't really get a sense of scale when you're looking at these in these movies uh but they're as big as a as an average size human being so they're quite large one of the interesting photographic challenges that we run into in photographing the tsm carrier disconnect from the inside of the tail service mast is once that door closes it's pitch black in there so there's a set of uh series of tungsten lamps that provide illumination and the vibrations the tremendous amount of vibrations that are induced during the during the liftoff uh really rattle those lights and keeping them from having those bulbs break is has been quite a challenge in fact they are in the process of changing those lights over to the new led arrays that provide more stability and less uh frequency of having the bulbs go out um before the film yeah they're a lot more robust to that kind of environment okay matt this is uh echo001 and this is uh one of the four cameras on the edges of the mlp deck this is on the this camera happens to be on the northeast corner of the mlp deck and it's a 16 millimeter camera as all the ones on the mlpr and 10 millimeter focal length it's a wide angle view and the effect of shutter speed is about 1 1200 of a second for our viewers uh you can see that we pulled a little bit away back from the vehicle now we're taking a little bit of a wider view there's the ssmes just firing off there and you can see the plume in the background uh growing in fact if you look carefully uh against the plume there you can see a couple of cameras um once you mention what those are those are some motv cameras operational television cameras that are used for surveillance of the of the vehicle there the uh and are piped back live to the launch control complex signals so the smes are firing you can actually see the launch tower on the right hand side of the screen and again they go on for about six seconds computers are making sure that everything's working and at t minus zero those boosters are going to fire and yeah you'll see a big puff of smoke come out of the flame trench there and it'll get sucked back down in uh as the boosters come off the pad and these two sort of uh structures uh one standing just to the left of the left booster and one standing just to the right of the right booster are called rain birds and uh there's some piping uh sort of flat against the launch pad as well that sort of connect all these things together there go the boosters firing and uh all of this fresh water 300 000 gallons to be exact comes pouring out of those rain birds and onto the launch pad to deaden the acoustic noise and cool the pad down so that's where the water comes from some of these camera shots and here you can see the uh the aec on the automatic exposure control on the cameras taking over as the booster plume comes into view and allows to see um the aec allows you to see the the detail both in the plume as well as in the vehicle and structure itself and you can also see very good detail on the the deck of the mlp now we talk a little bit about the purpose of each one of these cameras and this one is to look for some structural anomalies on the vehicle some thermal insulation failures we might have on the tiles or the blankets etc and how the water is getting dispersed on the pad and also we're looking at debris and actually you can see here that we've got quite a bit of debris in the field and debris is a big concern for the shuttle folks and we want to keep an eye on it to make sure we don't have anything that's going to threaten the vehicle now matt you can see that this is uh well this is camera echo 4. uh e004 it's on the uh corner of the mlp deck and uh very similar in field of view to the camera we just looked at what one of the things i like to point out as you can see one of the camera box enclosures we were talking about a little bit earlier uh in the left-hand side of the frame right in front of the uh the left srb yeah and in fact uh as we mentioned earlier in the in the piece there's about 125 cameras or so actually more uh that document any given launch and so for brevity in this piece and to make it watchable we had to have a lot of a lot of film hit the cutting room floor and it was really difficult for me too to cut a lot of it out because i loved all of the footage i'm a fan of each and every camera uh but that little camera there didn't get its uh it'd stay in the shade that that that film of the booster had to uh we'll have to have that for the director's cut in the future and uh just to give you a perspective this camera originally captured the scene at uh 400 frames a second so it's being played back at 24 frames so it's about 1 16 of the speed um that it was actually captured at to give us a real-time view now you can see here how absolutely gorgeous the day was and as we mentioned earlier it was about five o'clock in the afternoon so in the film industry they call this magic hour and and there's no question about it that this is one of the best times of day to take photographs of the shuttle you have these rich colors and uh just a beautiful blue sky to sort of highlight all of this so um i find these pictures second to none in all of the launch imagery that's been taken i should say that these boosters uh shed about 10 000 pounds of mass per second once they're lit up and that's each so it's 20 thousand pounds combined and you can really get the feel of of uh that awesome magnitude by looking at these images you see a piece of debris in the right sort of doing a ballet and in slow motion there this is some tie-down string from some water membranes under the srbs that we'll talk about in a few moments you know teams go through this uh this is engineering footage and the teams go through this and identify everything they see in it okay this uh this is a camera echo 36 and this is uh this camera is located on the fixed service structure at the 255 foot level we refer to the fixed service structure as the fss it's a 16 millimeter camera with a 16 millimeter focal length lens and the effect of shutter speed is about a 1200 of a second similar to some of the other ones that we've seen this is a long clip um in fact this is probably the longest clip uh that that i sort of chose for the uh the production there's a lot going on in here but it looks a little boring for a while because those engines are on for a long time so we're still at 400 frames a second here right yes yeah okay so there you see the main engines igniting you can see all of this water pouring into the flame trench there's a big flash uh the hydrogen and the oxygen lighting up i should tell you that uh coming out of that external tank uh inside there the cryogenic propellants liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen 750 gallons a second of liquid hydrogen is pouring into that engine cluster and 280 gallons a second of liquid oxygen all of these uh things being combined uh instantly effectively instantly to to create this fantastic combustion process burning 3000 pounds of propellants to turn it into water vapor every second and it's almost invisible when it comes out of the engines so the engines are turning on now and you can sort of see them glowing against the water pouring into the flame trench that water's there primarily to deaden the acoustic noise and keep things cool and you've got a good look at the belly of the orbiter here one of the purposes of this camera is to look to see if we lose any tiles uh due to the shock of ignition of the solid rocket boosters now you can see the boosters around just a couple of minutes and you see those red sort of ribbed uh surfaces there inside the flame trench those are actually um membranes to hold water and those will get burned away and you'll sort of see that in the film when the boosters fire there you see them right there and there's water in there that's sort of uh that's sort of getting jarred loose and turning into steam uh and and i'm assuming i don't know for sure that it prevents uh sort of a recirculation of the exhaust at liftoff probably again acoustic deadening noise and there you see those boosters firing off if you look in the upper left-hand corner you see the um the umbilical uh falling backwards there and then look at how the spatial main engines are punching through that that uh that water in the flame trench that's really cool yeah it is it is quite a dramatic shot and the uh you can see the uh auto exposure control on the on the lens as we've talked about um on some of the other views really helping to be able to see the detail on the uh the ssmes punching that hole as well as looking at the plume from the for the from the srb and seeing the the edge of the belly of the orbiter too see the ssmes aim a little bit off uh kilt there and you can see them hitting the uh the upper part of the mobile launch platform as they rise off amazing that they capture all that detail in the s the srb plumes it's good stuff it's a fantastic clip it really is this is a camera echo 41 this is on the fixed service structure on the fss at the 255 foot level it's a uh 10 millimeter focal length on the 16 millimeter camera it's a really interesting view and you know matt you want to provide some more details about what we're seeing yeah you can see the boosters have already fired and this big uh umbilical structure that you see swinging back uh is actually very massive the plate on the end of that is about a foot and a half by three foot uh square you'll see a close-up of that a little bit that's the um the uh ground umbilical to uh hook up to the uh the venting for the hydrogen tank and and it's got some nitrogen and helium purge lines and some instrumentation to go with it a pretty complicated structure you get a picture of that in a minute if you look at the mlp or the mobile launch platform you see all the water coming out of the rain birds under the launch pad again our active exposure kicking in there and giving us a great shot of the plumes as the vehicle clears the tower look on the right you can just see a tad of the ssme burning there that little blue cone fantastic detail there isn't it yeah it's a great shot echo 40 is one of my my favorite shots matt and this is on the fixed service structure on the fss at the 275 foot level just a bit higher than the two previous views we we saw and this is uh really an incredible view of not only the orbiter but the uh the beautiful ocean the late spring day in florida and very nice lighting uh on the tank and as well as you'll see on the orbiter surfaces yeah it truly is a magic hour on this uh that orange tank for those that aren't all that familiar with the shuttle that's foam it's insulating foam on the tank to keep the cryogenic propellants cold on the inside uh liquid oxygen liquid hydrogen are pretty chilly when they get into their liquid state you can actually virtually look into the cockpit here if you look carefully you can see the ocean right through the window just briefly there for a moment kind of fun there's discovery in all its glory this this engineering view is to look at uh any possible issues with the tiles or the thermal protection system on the vehicle and look at that absolutely gorgeous you can see some of the flakes of ice sort of tracking the vehicle as it moves upwards remember uh as we mentioned earlier that 3000 pounds of water vapor a second is coming out of the spatial main engines on the back it's pretty incredible and it's virtually invisible all right this view is of of a structure we call the gup which is the ground umbilical carrier plate which attaches to the ground umbilical carrier assembly sometimes called the gucker that plate is about a foot and a half by uh three foot it's a sizable plate you don't really capture the scale in this and you can see the vehicle is now lifted up and it's taking off that umbilical peels back right at uh solid rocket booster separation her detonation and matt this is a camera 33 and this is at on the fss it's at the 235 foot level um and is using a fairly long focal length lens it's and you can tell by the field of view that it is a long focal length lens and it's 75 millimeters now if you look you can see the boosters kind of surging it's not a continuous pass it sort of pushes and then slows down a little bit and what you're seeing there is the natural frequency of the booster thrust um i believe it was on the order of about seven hertz uh seven cycles a second and you can see that go by and hear the uh the aft skirt of the boosters going by with a really nice tight shot of the uh the exhaust this camera view is uh on the pad perimeter it's located at camera site 3. it's about 1273 feet away from the from the vehicle and it's the first in a series of the 35 millimeter cameras which will be seeing the upcoming uh sequences there's a lens on here the focal length is 500 millimeters or so and the effective uh exposure um is a 1 450th of a second and the camera's running at 180 frames per second yeah it's a beautiful shot and uh this is gonna as uh kevin sits first in the 35 millimeter shots they're a little better quality uh because they've just got more surface area to put an image on um you can see the ssmes firing and uh all in nominal operation here and as soon as they pull away from the pad you'll see the left booster in the background centered between the two service tail masks and just a gorgeous shot right there looking at the steam coming off the ssmes and this is a fantastic capture of what what remains behind after the vehicle clears the tower is you have all of this water and steam being pushed around in this amazing hostile acoustic environment i mean look at what's going on there this is all acoustic noise and shock coming from the boosters in the ssmes camera 63 is located on the pad perimeter one of the camera sites it's 1270 feet from the vehicle and it's using a hundred and 105 millimeter lens the camera is running at 180 frames a second and that's pushing about 630 feet of film through the camera per minute quite quite of quite a fast rate especially for 35 millimeter yeah you can see the spark is going there just getting ready to turn the main engines on and uh in the background you see the water tower that's where all that fresh water comes from to flood the pad to keep it chilled and deaden a lot of that acoustic noise that we've already seen what it looks like in the plume uh absolutely gorgeous day really accentuated by this shot blue sky in the background goes great with the uh the white exhaust plume coming out there and uh you can see a lot of splashing and stuff jetting out from all different directions at the bottom you'll see more of that shots that are coming up this shot is going to be the first uh of a bunch of different views as we march counterclockwise around the pad to look at it from different angles and there you can see the boosters have fired and you see it all coming out the other side of the flame trench and uh beautiful shot of it coming off the pad and the lighting at five o'clock in the afternoon on this late spring day is just about perfect from this camera view of course it won't be perfect for all the views but uh certainly is a nice angle and really eliminates the vehicle as well as the structure very nicely yeah i like when uh when the vehicle leaves uh i left a lot of these shots run long because i thought it was kind of neat to see what happens afterwards and you can just see the the whole service structure here being engulfed in steam and exhaust from the solid rocket motors now one interesting thing about the 30 this particular 35 millimeter format is uh earlier we mentioned about the time code and the irig time code is uh burned in with an led display and on the 35 millimeter format it's actually in part of the the image area because the 35 millimeter format has four sprockets per frame uh so there's no way to position the uh the led time code in between the sprockets like we can on the 16 millimeter right so so if you looked at the the 16 millimeter you could actually see the the sprockets at the top and the bottom of each frame and those aren't visible in the 35 as you see here the uh the camera number uh is on the lower right hand uh on the lower right hand display of the led time code and it's in this case it's camera number 62 so the uh the 35 millimeter format also allows us to put a a camera designator number that's uh fairly often used just to help for viewing purposes and tracking purposes this again is a 105 millimeter lens and is on the pad perimeter approximately 1270 feet from the on the vehicle look at look at the the uh the the absolute force that all of this stuff is coming out of there i've talked uh earlier in the piece about how much is coming out of the solid rocket boosters 20 000 pounds uh combined and then the uh ssmes are losing three thousand pounds of uh liquid propellants a second and that really shows up here when you're looking underneath the launch platform you can see uh that all of that stuff doesn't have anywhere to go which is why it's vectored out on both sides uh so it can be um sort of safely directed away from the vehicle so there's no rebounding or or sort of backflow so to speak and one thing we haven't had a chance to talk about earlier is the uh how the cameras are triggered currently the camera's all triggered using the pox for the photo optical control system which triggers all the cameras on the pad perimeter on the fixed service structure as well as the the mlp and it's quite a sophisticated system to synchronize and trigger all the cameras based on the launch clock yeah it's undoubtedly a very complex system to have all these cameras operate uh flawlessly for each launch they're very important if not critical for for shuttle launches and um it's an amazing achievement that uh all the men and women who work on this are able to do it with such a degree of reliability every launch another shot here is as i said moving around counterclockwise you see the ssmes or the boosters are just firing excuse me and there you see the the gup falling back as we talked about earlier the umbilical assembly this view is using the same 105 millimeter focal length lens that the the other two views we just looked at and again is about 1200 feet from the from the vehicles where the camera site is located you know this was a really unusual day because you just mentioned earlier that you know from not from all views is the lighting going to be as good but this is about as good as it gets i mean each and every one of these camera views is well exposed uh both from an engineering and a beauty standpoint uh they're all very very nice shots and it's why we selected 124 uh to be the predominant content in this movie there's the the water tower by the way in the foreground it's just about to get engulfed with the exhaust this is a dog 68 it's a 35 millimeter camera and it's really uh uh intended to be a documentary camera so it's running at 28 frames per second not really a high-speed camera so it's it's almost real time a real-time camera view it's a just a really beautiful shot and because it's a documentary camera we're able to enlarge the aperture so the timing block isn't taking up image area and present it in it's a widescreen view and i think it's quite dramatic yeah from a from a beauty standpoint this is probably at the top of my list for favorites it's just gorgeous quality fantastic color saturation and very unusual for shuttle photography to be so beautiful at the same time so echo 55 begins our series of tracking cameras echo 55 is mounted on a kineto tracking mount or ktm which we commonly refer to it as and it's located at cs1 about 1200 feet from the vehicle this is a nice shot because you can see uh there's a bit of a distortion cloud here that we're shooting through and what that is is hydrogen being burned off um from the fueling system they they burn off any excess hydrogen to safely combust it and so that's what we're seeing here and it's really gorgeous as the vehicle sort of comes out of that and goes into its roll program clearing the tower again just a fantastically well lit photograph on this on this day some of the white things that you see falling off there are paper covers which protect some of the order maneuvering system engines we'll talk about those later but kevin the these are all manually operated right i mean there are human beings behind the scenes doing this tracking now yes this uh uh ktm or the can connector tracking mount has about four cameras that are mounted on it and this particular camera echo 55 is one of a pair of cameras and is intended to look at the top half of the vehicle while the other camera is intended to look at the bottom portion of the vehicle right and we'll see that in the next shot we'll have one of the uh one of the views from the bottom of the stack on the next one in fact our intent is uh to have in the deleted scenes on this disc um a set of camera pair views sort of pieced together so you can see them simultaneously so look for that in the extra features this is this is a fantastic now they're completely uh done with their roll program and uh sort of on their way yeah the uh the intent of that uh camera shot is only for the first 1200 feet uh of the ascent is uh really the uh the the intention of that uh that view and that takes about 18 to 20 seconds i believe okay now this is camera 52 and this of course is at the bottom of the stack now so it's a little different view and uh but part of a camera pair again right this is this camera is uh as you said is 52 and this is located on camera site uh two and is about the same distance 1200 feet uh 1270 feet from the vehicle nice shot of the ssmes there it it always amazes me how transparent the exhaust coming out of the ssmes is now this conetto tracking mount is uh is controlled by an operator manually controlled by an operator who's sitting in the lcc on the second floor below the firing room and the person he or she is using a trackball to track um the the vehicle and it's uh it's pretty tricky because they're just looking at a little video monitor and uh the vehicle is moving much faster in real time than we're seeing we're seeing it at uh you know one-fifth the speed in this particular case of uh what it is in real time uh this kineto tracking mount also has uh hdtv cameras that are mounted that are used for what we'll call quick look what's called quick look to look at the these views in real time and then in near real time uh you know when they start the uh image analysis uh this is done while the film is getting processed and uh transferred that was a fantastic shot um seeing the sun go right in between the two plumes and in fact it gives you an idea how bright these plumes are to the naked eye because the sun as it passed through there wasn't much brighter than the plumes that you saw wonderful shots showing the column of fire that the vehicle rises on and it really contrasts nicely with the blue again highlighting why sts-124 was was really the correct mission to to sort of springboard off of to show all the beautiful film this is a camera 57 this is at cs6 again 1200 feet from the pad or so and we're looking at the bottom half of the vehicle as i mentioned earlier that the camera is mounted on a tracker a ktm tracker has four or five different cameras on there and this is the lower half film camera looking at the bottom of the vehicle you can see the paper covers come off the rcs engines those are tieback covers just same same kind of material that you put on your house when building it and uh those covers are there in case they get a squall or a little stormwater the shuttle's out on the pad not uncommon in florida and we can't afford to have water inside those engines so we put those paper covers on there and they have these little pair of foils that inflate sort of tear the cover off they're just adhered with an adhesive of some kind so you'll see a lot of that white paper coming off during these launch shots beautiful shot looking up the tail end of the uh the stack and uh possibly on the deleted features or the deleted scenes on this disc we're going to try to edit a uh pieced together showing this the camera pair the views from the camera pairs pieced together and it should look pretty nice look at that on our our deleted scenes uh feature on the disc this is uh echo 225 as you can see it's already in flight it's a really interesting view it's a medium range uh tracking camera the mount and the camera are located at ucs4 which is about 2.4 miles north of the pad one of the reasons i selected this shot uh to be included on the dvd is because um i thought it was really striking and really beautiful how in their role program as they went into their role the the sun sort of peaks over like it does here and then you can see the name pop out and uh slowly the whole orbiter becomes lit with the uh with the evening sun and the textures are fantastic here you can see the thermal blankets you can see some of the thermal exposure to the thermal blankets you see some variation in color and you can see the tiles literally make out the the boundaries of the tiles there so uh really a wonderful uh piece of footage and and a remarkable contribution to the dvd from a photography standpoint the lens that's on the camera is a 150 inch uh sheer lens it's a cat eye dioptic lens so it's got a mirror surface and it's about 4 000 millimeters of focal length if you converted the inches to millimeters just to give it perspective matt the weight of this lens is about 250 pounds just the lens itself it's a huge lens and a really unbelievable piece of optics you can really see a lot of nice textures on this shot too on the on the booster if you look at the the forward part of the booster you can see the access panels and that big line coming off the external tank that's actually the oxygen feed line on the external tank that's where that 280 gallons a second of liquid oxygen are flowing through to the main engines that feed lines about 17 inches in diameter so it's a pretty beefy system and i think another thing to point out here is that this camera mount is manually tracked so the operator is looking through a bore sight at the camera site launch vibrations going on all around uh hammerhart and keeping uh that uh vehicle uh dead center in the frame and it's a quite amazing um feat to be able to do that so quite so accurately yeah they uh they've done a great job of keeping on target every step of the way now they're getting a little further away obviously and you can see uh sort of the glow of those engines starting to come up against the bottom part of the uh the stack there as they call it and um lets you know that something's going on at the back end of that vehicle so the next series of shots we're going to see is the views from the hd cameras and in this particular view this is uh from sts-114 return to flight so this was in july 26 of 2005. and we're about one about two miles from the pad just south of uh pad 39b here and the camera is uh is cocked at a 45 degree angle to enable maximum use of the 16 by 9 aspect ratio that is available with the hd tv cameras now it's important our viewers take a good look into the left window there you can actually see eileen collins who commanded this mission you can see your suit inside the window um absolutely amazing and this is a first right this is a first in the program we started using high definition video after columbia and that was one of the first times we saw this level of detail in photography that's that is correct so this particular camera view is ehv 225 this was recorded on sts-117 it was in june 2006 and the camera is running at 60 frames a second as all the hdtv cameras do the the orientation of the camera is uh is cocked at 45 degrees to make maximum use of the aspect ratio of the 16x9 frame to get as much of the vehicle um space shuttle vehicle in the frame as possible this particular shot i chose because um it's well exposed and it shows a beautiful uh sequence in the roll program but you also get this really nice vapor phenomenon as the vehicle accelerates uh to higher speeds and this is not always visible to the uh for every launch is it's a consequence of atmospheric conditions dew point humidity etc so um i thought it was kind of a nice nice touch to this particular image this is the only long-range camera that made the final cut and kevin will give you the details about that in a moment but i want you to look at the bottom of the tank there as you saw it just sort of became engulfed in flames and you should know that this is a normal phenomenon in a shuttle launch what's effectively occurring here is the exhaust gases coming out of the srbs and the ssmes are sort of expanding into the higher vacuum as they head into space and the radiant heat from the expanded plumes becomes high enough to ignite some volatile gases that are caught up in this aerodynamic dead zone so to speak at the rear of the tank for a couple of moments during flight but this is an amazing shot kevin because it's from so far away so why don't you explain uh what we're looking at here yeah matt the camera here is located at a place called apollo beach it's within cape canaveral national seashore and the camera mount is about 20 miles north of the pad so it's quite a distance away this is a brashear 150 inch lens again about 4 000 millimeters so quite quite a distance in the trackers as we mentioned earlier is manually operated says an operator looking through a uh a scope and uh using a trackball to keep the uh the vehicle in the field of view yeah it's also difficult for the operator because of the distance to see the vehicle at launch to sight the pad yeah it's just so he has to tighten the light right so so he or she grabs it on the fly and it's it's quite a quite a skill level that's uh that needs to be developed in order to do that well and of course we watched our solid rocket boosters separate um which is uh sort of at the tail end of what we can see with with all of the tracking cameras and um there you see our boosters coming off and they they separated about 29 miles in altitude about two minutes into flight and they are recovered by divers out in the atlantic ocean and uh although they appear to be falling back here they're actually traveling another 15 miles or so up just tumbling on their own forward momentum before they peak and then come back down in the atlantic about 150 miles out where the diving things pick them up and bring them back for refurbishment so this sort of brings us to the end of our production um i hope you guys have enjoyed the commentary kevin and i have enjoyed uh doing it today for you and uh as the boosters sort of fade out and the external tank and the orbiter continue on their way to orbit we want to dedicate this movie to all of the men and women over the 30 years of the program or so that have committed themselves to capturing all of these fine images it's uh amazing work takes a lot of commitment and it's extraordinarily tough to do so and our hat's off to them so kevin thanks for doing this with me thank you um it's been a wonderful endeavor and hopefully we'll see each other again on the next space program so signing off you

10 Most Expensive Things Owned By Donald Trump",10 Most Expensive Things Owned By Donald Trump,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MY_4VmvXrMw,0,656999,4863,668,930,MY_4VmvXrMw,"by any measure Donald Trump is filthy rich currently worth just over three billion dollars the real estate mogul and television star who found a third career as president of the United States can afford just about anything he wants and he has no problem showcasing that ability to everyone around him aside from his documented love of cheap fast food there isn't much Donald Trump purchases that the average person could afford here now are the big questions here are the most incredible things the president spends his billions on so many cars like many rich people Donald Trump has an exquisite car collection his might be among the most impressive around though more for quality rather than quantity Trump doesn't collect dozens of cars but what he does own are some of the most expensive most powerful and highest quality luxury vehicles ever made he owns of 2003 mercedes-benz SLR McLaren which ran over four hundred and forty five thousand dollars upon release he also keeps a 1997 Lamborghini Diablo VT a Mercedes Maybach s600 a Tesla Roadster and a 2016 Cadillac Escalade in addition he keeps a 2015 rolls-royce phantom around this vehicle starts at $500,000 and is fully customizable who knows how much Trump spent to make the interior as lush and golden as he likes everything else then there's his 2011 Chevrolet Camaro Indianapolis 500 pace car which was a legitimate pace car that he was apparently supposed to drive in the 2011 Indy 500 until scheduling issues make that impossible finally there's his 1956 rolls-royce Silver Cloud which is technically a replica this was one of trumps first cars and he fell in love with it so much he eventually paid rolls-royce to make him a new one just like it the offer was clearly enticing enough that the company happily agreed seventeen golf clubs as he's shown many times over the past few years Donald Trump loves the game of golf he's been investing in the sport since 1999 when he fell purchased his first club but he certainly didn't stop at one currently the president owns not one not two but 17 different golf courses around the world many of his clubs were properties he snatched up after the Great Recession of 2008 even still he spent hundreds of millions of dollars simply on buying all these properties never mind renovating them and turning into worthy showcases of both his brand and his favorite pastime take the trump National Golf Club in Los Angeles Trump paid 27 million dollars to buy the course from its former owners after a landslide sunk the 18th hole and forced the club into bankruptcy Trump and his organization have since spent over two hundred and sixty million dollars renovating and updating it making it the single most expensive golf course in history though most of trumps golfed properties are based in the US he also owns several courses in Ireland Scotland and Dubai once he leaves office there's no reason to think he won't seek to add even more causes possibly in more countries to his repertoire that way he can golf on his own course literally anywhere 100 million dollar private airplane if Trump ever feels like a luxury helicopter is too cramped he's always got his luxury private jet to play around in his personal Boeing 757 is among the most valuable and most powerful private planes on the earth Trump purchased the Boeing which had been built in 2011 for an incredible a hundred million dollars that alone makes the jet now formally dubbed Trump Force One the eighth most expensive plane in the world it's likely worth even more now that its owner has upgraded it so much inside you'll find a lounge bedrooms a dining room a guest room and Trump's own personal master bedroom inside the master bedroom is a private cinematic entertainment system and a private bathroom that bathroom as befitting Trump sports a sink with a 24 karat gold interior but don't feel left out yet if you can to use that sink just about everything on the plane that can be is plated in gold the plane itself is a technical marvel featuring a state-of-the-art computerized glass cockpit and boasting two rolls-royce engines that can propel Trump Force One to speeds exceeding 500 miles an hour it's no wonder Trump didn't exactly want to park it in favor of the official Air Force 1 upon taking office but that's exactly what he had to do as the presidential plane has actual security measures and access to military operational secrets and procedures he'll just have to wait until the job is done to fly his beloved Trump Force One again three helicopters lots of rich people own helicopters Trump meanwhile reportedly has three mostly because he's well Trump to be fair we've only seen two of them and considering how much Trump likes to show off his wealth it's rather curious he doesn't show off all of his whirly Birds but he's certainly wealthy enough to own more than one chopper if he likes this second helicopter isn't technically his well not permanently anyway that would be marine one the official White House helicopter that due to security reasons is the only chopper he's allowed in while he's president that'll be just one of the many perks he can look forward to after returning to his private life the ability to fly in his other most famous chopper in 2011 he bought a used sikorsky s-76 copter spending upwards of seven million dollars to acquire it but the ride wasn't to coin a phrase Trumpy enough for the Trump so he reportedly spent an extra seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars so famous New York aircraft designer Eric Roth could make the copter worthy of its owner's name the mission was most certainly accomplished as the Sikorsky now with the name Trump spelled outside in giant lettering is pure helicopter luxury almost everything inside from the seats to the pillows are either colored or covered in gold much of the wooden surfaces have the Trump family crest painted on it in gold of course even the seat belts are gold because Donald Trump is nothing if not dedicated to stamping his personality onto everything he owns Gold everything we can't proceed any further into an article about Donald Trump without mentioning what he seemingly loves most of all gold perhaps the ultimate symbol of luxury and a well-off life Trump refers as much of his world be adorned in gold as possible from gold rimmed cups and plates to gold-plated sinks in his private planes Trump's world is only slightly less covered in gold than King Midas's the furniture blankets and curtains in his jets and homes are even laced with gold this even applies at his new job where he's replaced the curtains in the Oval Office with gold colored and gold rimmed curtains if he thought he could hit a golf ball accurately with gold-plated golf clubs he probably would and because this is Donald Trump his gold possessions aren't just colored that way whenever possible he uses genuine 24 karat gold to turn his world into a monument to his wealth his love of the shiny metal is so far-reaching he'd love to officially make it how the United States makes and spends its money the u.s. abandoned the gold standard in 1973 but Trump has made several comments since announcing his campaign for president about how he would return to that standard whether that happens or not it's clear that Trump will continue to adhere to his own personal gold standard for the rest of his days real estate forget the politics and the apprentices Donald Trump is first and foremost a real estate guy he's been active in the industry since joining his father's company in the 1960s it's where he made his billions and where he likely will continue to do so after leaving office currently Trump invests in properties all over the world outside of the US buildings in Canada India the Philippines South Korea Turkey and Uruguay all bear his name and fingerprints in the United States Trump owns buildings in New York New Jersey Connecticut Illinois Florida Hawaii and Nevada it's difficult to say how much money he's invested over the decades but considering his specialty is high-class luxury apartment life it's safe to say he spent hundreds of millions if not billions between buying selling and investing in all of these properties Trump currently isn't active in real estate due to all the duties that come with running a humongous country but it must be comforting to know that once his political career he'll definitely have something lucrative to fall back on the Trump winery despite being a teetotaler who claims to have never even sipped alcohol in his life Donald Trump owns a humongous winery clearly he's not his own best customer in 2011 Trump purchased Charlottesville Virginia's Cluj estate winery and vineyard which was at risk of foreclosure he ultimately paid just over 3.5 million dollars for the estate through methods one could describe his both creative and Shady according to Bank of America who had paid 16 million dollars for the property's mansion at a foreclosure auction Trump first purchased acres of land around the estate then arranged for it to intentionally look closed off in Raggedy this move alleges Bank of America made other potential buyers shy away from making an offer as they thought the property was either wrecked beyond repair or exclusively earth by shrub thus without any other options the bank took a bath and accepted Trump's offer whatever you think of this method it was clearly worth it as the former Clews winery is currently valued at over 25 million dollars since renaming it after who else himself Trump's revamped it to be much more than a winery it's gone a clubhouse a hotel it can host weddings and corporate events and it's crafted several high-scoring and award-winning vintages Goat a tribute to Muhammad Ali not everything Donald Trump spends his money on his gold-plated in super flashy sometimes what he purchases has legitimate sentimental value such as his signed copy of a Muhammad Ali tribute book the fact that its cover is almost entirely gold is merely a bonus Trump has long been a huge fan of the boxing legend even tweeting after Ali's passing about how he was truly a great champion and a wonderful guy so it makes sense that he would pay top dollar for the book goat a tribute to Muhammad Ali of course everyone who owns this book did only 1,000 copies ever made it into circulation but not only was each one signed by the greatest each copy cost around $15,000 for Trump it was money easily spent well spent a gold-plated motorcycle Donald Trump isn't one to ride motorcycles but he's most definitely one to own one but being who he is he couldn't just buy a regular expensive motorcycle in court today no he had to find a way to adorn it with as much gold if not more than his usual insane purchases in 2012 Trump visited the set of American Chopper and the show's stars agreed to customize a special motorcycle just for the future president it was pure Trump with gold plating and lining everywhere the tank was gold the handlebars were gold and even the wheels were gold the Trump name made it right onto the pedal and the engine but what good is having a chopper like this made just for you if even one person doesn't know it's for you we don't know exactly how much Trump paid with his commission or how much it's worth only that it can't possibly be less than tons we do know however that Trump heartily approved of the project and isn't making the customer happy what really counts Trump Tower by 1995 Donald Trump had a ton to his name so why not spin the money to add not just one more thing but thee one more thing he did just that by purchasing a 71 story building at 40 Wall Street in New York City renaming it naturally the Trump building the total cost ten million dollars the total value damn near priceless this building has a storied history that long predates Trump it was built in the late 1920s as part of the so-called race to the sky a competition between several NYC fat cats to see who could build the world's tallest habitable building the 920 7-foot Trump building then known as the Manhattan company building actually won the race briefly until a month later when the nearby Chrysler Building added a giant spire to surpass it at a thousand and 46 feet the Manhattan company called shenanigans since spires aren't exactly livable but less than a year later that twelve hundred and fifty foot Empire State Building showed up and claimed the tallest title outright by the time Trump showed up the building was in bad shape having been neglected four years after a shadowy 1982 deal brokered by Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos fell through Trump purchased the lease in 1995 for ten million dollars though he's since claimed he only spent 1 million either way it's clearly been a sound investment as experts currently pegged the building's worth at over a billion dollars making a Trump's most valuable building by far not bad for a place that was just shy of

This is part one of a planned two-part video covering Operation MI. As you can see I spent a considerable amount of time covering Nagumo’s Dilemma. To me it's one of most striking examples of how tough it can be for a commander to make a decision based on the information at hand. I found that to be the most interesting aspect of the battle.

Corrections: 

""Strength"" , ""Auxiliary"", and ""unknown"" are misspelled in the video. 

At 22:55 I should have stated “North of Midway” instead of Northeast of Midway. The illustration shows a 10 degree 240 nm from midway location. Not so Northeast as I audibly stated.

At 23:43 I should have stated 79 aircraft instead of 78 and I should have displayed 35 instead of 34 torpedo bombers. the “mistake” came about because sources still differ on whether there were 27 or 26 Carrier attack planes (Kates). If it was 27 it would have been 79 Planes. if it was 26 it would have been 78. During the recording I somehow mixed up the numbers. 

Additional Notes:
notice that the carriers started off the battle in a box formation. This provided further mutual support for their rather weak AA fire. however, due to the incessant air attacks from VT-8, VT-6 and VT-3, the carriers were never able to reform in a box formation, instead they were in a ragged line which further worsened their AA capabilities. 

-----------------------------------------Spoiler Below regarding Nagumo's Dilemma---------------------------------------------

So what was the answer to Nagumo’s Dilemma?

“Taking all together, and admittedly operating with the benefit of hindsight, the “right” answer to Nagumo’s conundrum probably should have emphasized maneuver, offensive speed in preference to mass, and passive damage control. With fifteen minutes in which to act, he didn’t really have time to implement anything terribly fancy. But he could have helped himself immensely by immediately spotting every strike airplane in his hangars, whether they were armed or not, and launching them at the Americans. The sixty-four armed aircraft he had in had were perfectly capable of doing enormous damage to his enemy. And by emptying his hangars, he removed the single greatest danger to his carriers --- the presence of fueled and armed aircraft within them.”

Japan needed to end the war quickly before the US, with its mighty industrial strength, ultimately defeated them. So, what Japan needed was to win a decisive battle - one that would demoralize the Americans and finally bring them to the negotiating table. It was considered that America's center of gravity was its Pacific Fleet, primarily its carriers. Destroy this and you destroy their will to continue the war. Therefore, the only chance Japan had a winning this war was if the American carrier fleet was destroyed. But the question was: how to provoke the carriers from leaving it's safe base at Pearl Harbor? The answer: attack an objective that the Americans wouldn't relinquish without a fight and, after much debate, it was decided that Midway would be that objective.  If the Japanese attacked and invaded Midway, the Americans would certainly respond in force and this would finally give the Imperial Japanese Navy a chance to annihilate the American carrier fleet, once and for all. And thus, Operation MI was created with the objective of capturing Midway and destroying the Pacific Fleet. The Japanese premised their plan on achieving surprise and therefore would have to make the 3,000 mile voyage on radio silence. Also, they were to disperse their forces in order to avoid detection and mask their intentions. In conjunction, there was another operation to the north to take over the Aleutian Islands, which was code-named Operation Al. And so, on the early hours of June 4th, all the forces were in position to attack a small tiny atoll in the Central Pacific. The stage was set for one of the most epic engagements in naval history. This is the Battle of Midway. The battle will be told from the Japanese perspective. The fog of war will be included during this video. That means you, the audience member, will only know the positions of the Americans the moment the Japanese commander  knew of it. This is to put the audience member in the commander's seat to see how they would have reacted themselves given the unique circumstances and complex scenarios that plagued the Japanese on the morning of June 4th. So, to start off, let's see who the commander was and what his forces were. Spearheading the MI formations were four top-of-the-line fleet carriers of the First Mobile Striking Force, also known as the Kido Butai. This was the most destructive offensive weapon the Japanese Navy had and would be the main protagonists of the upcoming fight. Its commander is Vice Admiral Nagumo Chuichi. He was 55 and had assumed command of the First Air Fleet in April of 1941. He didn't get this post because he had a naval aviation experience. In fact, he has specialized in torpedoes. He got the job simply based on seniority. It was said his command style lacked decisiveness and that he was too reliant on his staff. Nevertheless, in June of 1942, he was the most experienced carrier commander in the world. Nagumo had four carriers with him this day. His flagship was the Akagi. The Akagi was the oldest and longest of all the flat tops. She had a large aircraft capacity and since she had been converted from a battle cruiser hull, possessed a high speed. The Kaga was a battleship conversion so this made her the least maneuverable and the slowest of the four but she did embark the most aircraft. While typical squadron strength was 18, she herself carried 27 carrier attack planes. These two carriers were just solid war horses of the Kido Butai. They packed a mean punch and were not to be messed around with. Next came to two dashing cavaliers of Carrier Division 2. They were the smaller but more nimble Soryu class. They were designed from the keel up, had a good air group size, and a very high speed due to their light hull and construction. However, the downside was that they were lightly armored. The Soryu came first, being commissioned in 1937. She was well liked in the Navy. Her near sister ship, the Hiryu, was almost identical but had a larger bridge and was slightly better armored. Real Admiral Yamaguchi was a commander of Carrier Division 2 and he made the Hiryu his flagship. He was another high-ranking member of the fleet and was known to be an aggressive, hot-temper commander compared to Nagumo. From the four carriers, Nagumo had a combined strength of 248 aircraft; 260 total aircraft if one includes the scout planes from his escorting cruisers. What was equally important in the aircraft themselves was the quality of Nagumo's air crews. It wasn't a stretch to say that at this point in the war, the best naval pilots in the world were onboard these four ships. Nagumo's mission was not going to be a walk in the park. He essentially had a dual mission: One, take out Midway. He needed to neutralize the base and its aircraft before the invasion convoy arrived two days later. Task number two was to keep a lookout for enemy carriers that might appear in the defense of the islands. Now, this was unlikely as the Americans were not expected to react so quickly to the invasion. But as a safe measure, he was to keep half of his strike force armed with anti-shipping weapons in the event the Americans did show up early. It has to be mentioned here that there were some ominous signs for the Japanese. As mentioned, the Japanese were counting on surprise for this bold operation to succeed. However, on the eve of battle, there were signs that this may not be going their way. Intelligence had revealed suspicious enemy activities around Midway, meaning the Americans were more alert than they should have been. Second, it must be emphasized that the Japanese, up to this point, have failed to confirm the location of the carriers. The Japanese believed they would have to face against two, possibly three carriers to their four, so it was imperative that they get a confirmation of their whereabouts. It was believed that they would still be in Pearl Harbor during the first days of the operation and there were two attempts to verify this. The first was a reconnaissance mission to reconnoiter Pearl Harbor. However, this mission had been canceled but there was still a fallback plan: a picket line of submarines ahead of Nagumo's force, and, so far, none of them had reported anything at all. So as far as Nagumo was concerned, everything was going as planned. Dawn: June 4th. Compared to the scatter cloud cover to the northeast, the Kido Butai found itself under low, but light cumulus clouds. The carriers continue to steam into the wind, which is coming from the southeast, to prepare for the air raid. At 0430, a strike of 108 aircraft was launched against Midway. All of these planes were launched in just 10 minutes, a testament to the skill and training of the Japanese pilots. Leading the strike was Lieutenant Tomonaga Joichi. He was a veteran of the air war over China, but this will be his first combat sortie against the Americans. Nagumo had to keep the other half of his planes in reserve in case American carriers appeared. The pilots in this group were the A-team, the best the Kido Butai had to offer. Akagi's torpedo squadron was said to be the best in the Navy, while Carrier Division 2 had the reputation of having the best dive bombers. Any report of an American carrier and these pilots will make easy work of them. At the same time of the launch of the Midway Strike Group, reconnaissance planes were sent out from the escorting cruisers. The search consisted of 7 lines, 6 of which stretched out to 300 miles. Clearly, with only seven planes to cover more than a 176,000 square miles, the search effort can be considered half-hearted, perhaps even negligent. But, in Nagumo's defense, it must be reminded that this was a precautionary air search. Simply put, Nagumo and his staff were convinced that no enemy carriers would appear this early into the battle. Although, I would say criticism is justified. I mean, given the fact that intel reported suspicious activities around Midway, and given the bad weather in the area, Nagumo should have doubled his search efforts as a safety measure. It's what a prudent commander would have done. Anyway, the launch of the search planes went well except the launching of Float Plane No. 4, from the cruiser Tone, was delayed for thirty minutes. As the military proverb goes: ""no plan survives contact with the enemy,"" and today would be no exception. The operation officially began to unravel at 0532. An American Catalina PBY was spotted surveying the Kido Butai. Damn, Nagumo had been spotted, meaning surprise had been lost. This meant that the Americans would be able to get their land-based aircraft airborne before his strike arrived. As predicted, the Americans have been able to launch all of its planes before the strike arrived. The bombers went to attack the Japanese carriers. Only the fighters stayed behind to defend the islands. These were 18 obsolete Buffaloes and 6 Wildcats. They intercepted the Japanese at 0620, 30 miles from the base. They never stood a chance with the more agile Zeros. In the ensuing battle, 13 Buffaloes and 2 Wildcats were lost. The carrier strike aircraft pushed through and began their bomb runs. Carrier Division 2-level bombers struck first at 0634. The dive bombers would come next at 0640. On Eastern Island, the power plant, command posts, gasoline lines, and mess hall were destroyed but damage to the runways was minor. On Sand Island, the oil tanks were set ablaze and the water lines were hit. A seaplane hangar and various base facilities were also destroyed. For their effort, American fighters and anti-aircraft fire destroyed 11 Japanese planes. Another 14 will be rendered unserviceable when they landed back on their carriers. That's a 23% loss. The damage to Midway support facilities had been heavy but the base wasn't out of the fight. The Air Group commander, Lieutenant Tomonaga, looked back at the condition of Midway and, with great dissatisfaction, had to report back to Nagumo that a second strike was needed to neutralize the base. What follows next is a series of complicated events and situations happening to both the Kido Butai and onboard Nagumo's headquarters. So, I'll tackle them separately starting with the initial air strikes against the Kido Butai. At 0710, 6 TBF Avengers and 4 Army B-26s were spotted approaching the Japanese carriers. This would be the first of four separate attacks from Midway-based aircraft that would harass them throughout the early morning. Over 30 fighters were sent to destroy the 10 American warplanes. The Avengers selected the Hiryu. Zeros swarmed over them and one-by-one, the torpedo bombers were shot down. Only two were able to launch at the Hiryu but from extreme range and they missed. The 4 B-26s, which had been modified to carry torpedoes, went for the Akagi. Only 2 were able to launch but they both missed. The real danger was posed by the last B-26. The damaged bomber made no attempt to pull out of its attack. Instead, it headed directly for a Akagi's bridge. Nagumo and his staff saw this and were shocked. The Americans were not supposed to show this kind of bravery. The bomber pressed on and at last minute - narrowly missed the bridge and crashed into the sea. This suicide attack had failed, but surely it had given Nagumo and his staff one hell of a scare. Despite the bravery and determination, the attack had failed to achieve a single hit. 5 Avengers and 2 Marauders had been shot down. The Japanese lost 2 Zeros. Half-an-hour later, at 0753, a new force was spotted approaching the Mobile Force: 16 Marine Corps Dauntless dive-bombers. 9 Zeros set out to destroy them. The dive bombers pressed on and went for the Hiryu. Instead of going for a steep dive, ensuring accuracy, these planes conducted a glide bombing attack. They were clearly inexperienced pilots if this was their way of attacking. They managed to bracket the Hiryu with some near misses, but ultimately, no hits were scored. They lost half of their squadron, leaving only eight survivors to return to Midway. The Japanese lost only 1 Zero. Shortly after that attack, 15 Army B-17s attacked from 20,000 feet. At this altitude, the B-17s were immune to the anti-aircraft fire below them. However, this also greatly diminished their accuracy. They went after the Soryu, Hiryu, and Akagi. But the carrier's below them had more than enough time to conduct evasive maneuvers and avoid the bombs. There were no losses on either sides and no hits were scored; only near misses on the Soryu and Hiryu caused any alarm. A remarkable set of photographs were taken at this moment Here's the Hiryu dodging a couple of very near misses. Note the 3 fighters of Combat Air Patrol on her flight deck. Here, we got the Akagi, Nagumo's flagship, while under attack. Easily noticeable is the red Rising Sun painted on the deck. The third picture shows the Soryu. She's conducting a tight turn to starboard to avoid being hit. Carrier doctrine and flight deck operations need to be commented on here. During attacks, the main priority was obviously the defense of the carriers. This came in 3 forms: Japanese anti-aircraft fire capabilities were very weak, so could not be counted on. So this left fighter cover and evasive maneuvers as the main forms of defense for Nagumo's force. There was a downside though: one, due to the evasive maneuvers that require wild and violent turns, it was obviously dangerous to spot or launch a squadron of aircraft while being bombed. So let's say you wanted to launch an airstrike, but then you found yourself under attack, it would actually be better to wait until the attack was over to then fly off for strike. Second point: as these pictures show, Japanese flight decks had to be kept clear anyways during air attacks for the replenishment of their own fighters. This was rather frequent since a Zero had about 7 seconds of canon ammunition. Fighters were given priority because they did after all provide the most effective measure of defense. Hence, the only activity you would see during attacks was the recovery, replenishment, and relaunching of these small packets of fighters: three at a time, sometimes six at a time. In other words. and the point I'm trying to drive in here was that, as a general rule, you couldn't launch a strike while under attack. So let's just say hypothetically then, at this moment, Nagumo wanted to send a strike. It was prudent to just wait until the attack was over, maybe 15, 20 minutes, and then launch his aircraft. So, maybe these attacks aren't being accurate, or deadly, but they are hindering flight operations. Keep this in mind as you will see the fateful consequences of it. Midway's final attack came at 0827. Eleven old Marine Corps Vindicator dive-bombers arrived from the southeast. These were obsolete bombers and they wisely decided not to go for the formatively defended carriers. Instead, they selected the battleship Haruna as their target. There were 11 fighters on Combat Air Patrol to oppose them. The Americans persisted and made their dives on the Haruna, but once again, none of them scored a hit. Two Vindicators were lost during the attack. In the midst of all of this, a submarine had been spotted and at 0825, it fired a torpedo at the battleship Kirishima. The battleship dodged it by turning to port and the destroyer Arashi was detached and sent in pursuit to chase down the submarine. As you can see, this had all been a narrow escape for the Japanese. These series of close calls surely had everyone on the edge of their seats. Although the Japanese were impressed by the determination of the attacks, they were not impressed by the skills of these pilots. Despite 52 planes being dedicated to the attack, not a single hit was achieved on the Japanese. The biggest success these attacks had was that it had kept the Japanese off-balance from 0700 to 0830, which, as we will see, was a critical time for Nagumo. During the early morning attacks on the Kido Butai, a more serious situation was developing in the high command with Nagumo and his staff. Shortly after 0700 hours, Nagumo received Tomonaga's report that a second strike was needed. The news was unpleasant, but had actually been expected. How could a force of 72 bombers, half of which were armed with medium sized bombs, be expected to neutralize a fortified base? He could allow Tomonaga's flight to return, refuel and rearm, and then send them back. But, of course, this would take hours to complete, allowing the Americans to lick their wounds and reform their defense. This would contribute to further casualties. Or, alternatively, he could strike the Americans while they were still down. He could use his reserve aircraft, who, at the moment, stood idly by doing nothing. But these were exclusively off the table because Yamamoto had ordered them to be reserved in case of an enemy carrier task force appearing. But, surely Yamamoto wasn't expecting Nagumo to fight an entire battle with only half his strength? I mean, come on, this was tantamount to making Nagumo fight the entire battle with one arm tied behind his back. This right here had been the fault in the whole Midway plan. There simply weren't enough planes. There weren't enough planes to do the dual mission, to both attack Midway and to keep a reserve in case enemy carriers appeared. So, Nagumo looked at the maps, and by now, his air searches were reaching their maximum range and so far, nothing had been found or reported. So, why not use these planes for the second strike? Let's not forget that, at this moment, a Maverick plane from Midway had just tried to suicide crash into his bridge. Midway was clearly still a threat and as long as his airbase was operational, it posed a danger to his carriers. This is what probably prompted Nagumo's consequent decision: Midway had to be neutralized. Thus, at 0715, Nagumo went against Yamamoto's orders and ordered the rearmament of his reserve aircraft. The rearming process began in the hangars below. Torpedoes were removed and land bombs installed. The dive bombers weren't affected by this because they were armed once they had been spotted on the flight decks. So, in reality, this chaotic, fast-paced rearming process was happening only in the hangars of the First Carrier Division. All in all, this process was going to take about 1.5hrs to complete. Then, 30 minutes into the rearmament process, at 0745, Nagumo received a report. That Tone plane, the one that had been delayed, ran across an American force and sights what appears to be ten enemy surface units. Nagumo was stunned. He quickly cancelled and reversed the rearmament order and took stock of the situation. It will basically boil down to two options for him: Send an immediate strike right now or send the strike after Tomanaga's planes were recovered. This is what is most commonly known as ""Nagumo's Dilemma."" So, I will ask the viewer to put themselves in Nagumo's shoes for a while to better understand his conundrum. I'll let you know it's not as simple as it looks - many factors have to be considered. Keep in mind that you would have had only 15 minutes to decide on the correct course of action Let's first dive into the aggressive option, which is attacking immediately. First off, the sighting didn't even make sense. Based on the location, Tone No. 4 plane was never supposed to come across it. Either he wasn't where he was supposed to be or the task force location was incorrect. This brings up the composition factor - it was unknown. What did ten ships mean? It could be a carrier task force or they could simply be auxilary ships. Nagumo didn't know and this was unsettling. What if he sends a strike and the sighting proved to be just destroyers or support ships? This had actually happened to Admiral Takagi a month earlier in the Battle of Coral Sea. Nagumo did not want a repeat of that mistake. But there were two additional alarming clues about the sighting. Why was there force 240 miles northeast of Midway? There would be no reason for a force to be in this location unless it contained a carrier. And if it was a carrier, it would be in a prime position to unleash an attack on the Japanese's flank. And more importantly, why was it steering into the wind? It was known that it was procedure for aircraft carriers to steam into the wind when launching the aircraft. Nagumo and his staff apparently saw the validity of these two clues but in the end, came to the conclusion that it was most likely just a surface force. Second, the rearmament process wasn't as devastating as many believe. The Val dive-bombers weren't affected by this, only the Kates. 34 had been armed with torpedoes, but now, only 19 were ready. 15 have been switched to land bombs. So instead of having a full strike complement of 78 planes, he now only had 64 planes properly armed. Although, that's only a difference of 15. 64 planes were more than enough to sink any task force encountered. Here's a third factor: time. Nagumo was restricted on time because Tomonaga force would soon be arriving at about 0815 and it would be low on fuel meaning they had to be landed quickly unless they were forced to ditch sea. This was the worst timing ever for Nagumo. Japanese flight decks were restricted in that they could only do one operation at a time. They could either launch, recover, or spot aircraft. Thus, Nagumo had to decide: either launch his counter strike now, or recover the Midway strike. The fuel situation was troubling. If he didn't want to lose any more planes through ditching, he needed to finish the recovery by 0845 at the latest. Why 0845? Well, let's take a look and work backwards to calculate the time constraints. It's 0745 now. Tomonaga's planes had enough fuel to fly overhead until about 0915. It would take 20 to 30 minutes to land them. That makes 0845 the threshold. You'd better finish your launching process by this time or you'll start losing aircraft by ditching. This leaves Nagumo with an hour of leeway, and it took about 45 minutes to spot and launch an air strike. So, if he wants to take this opportunity to launch an attack with what he's got, he can - but, he would have to start the process by 0800 at the latest. Thus, this is the 15 minute window Nagumo got to make a decision. Geez, talk about being under pressure, huh? Was an attack feasible? Yes, it was. It will be a tight squeeze, but if he began now by 0800, by 0845, his counter strike would have taken off and Tomonaga's planes, who will be flying on fumes at this point, will then land. However, scratch that hypothetical because at 0753, the Kido Butai came under attack by those dive-bombers. Theoretically, he could still launch a strike while under attack, although this was rarely done in combat and it was extremely risky. But one thing was for sure: that 45-minute launching process would have definitely stretched out closer to the length of an hour. As a result, the possibility of Tomonaga's air group having to commit a mass ditch would become likely. Disposing of perhaps dozens of aircraft at the start of a battle was unthinkable. So, Nagumo had to decide: does he attack this unknown target based in this sketchy, unconfirmed location, with some of his planes carrying the wrong ordnance, and risk losing additional planes by unnecessary ditching? Or, he could simply wait until Tomonaga's strike had landed and then after recovery, launch a full balanced strike and whatever this target is with the proper ordnance. This was clearly the ultra-safe choice that offered no unnecessary risk. But what made Nagumo think he still had time? Well, if we take the reported position at face-value, the location meant that even if this force contained a carrier, it wouldn't have been within strike range of an escorted strike. The Americans would have to close the distance and then launch a strike which meant it wouldn't reach Nagumo's carriers until about 1015, some two hours from now. Thus, Nagumo would have the time to launch his own counter strike before he himself was reached. So I ask the viewer to press pause and consider the options. Honestly, with all this information at hand, what would you have done? With the conservative mindset that Nagumo had, it's not too difficult to imagine which course of action he took. He went for the safest option. He would recover his planes first, and then launch a powerful, well-balanced strike at the enemy. Nagumo opted for this choice because it promised mass and coordination over anything else. For as much as Nagumo has been criticized, his decision was doctrinal. If any other Japanese commander had been in his place, they would have also made the same decision. So, let's continue the saga. Down below, the crews in the hangars worked feverishly to change the Kates with land bombs back again to torpedoes. In the midst of all the chaos, the bombs were not stored away safely. Instead, they were laid haphazardly around the hangar. Above in the bridge, Nagumo waited impatiently for further information and it wasn't until 0820 that identification of the surface units finally came through. This was dreadful news. Well, you may ask, why not attack now that you have definite confirmation of a carrier? Well, it would still take 45 minutes to get the aircraft out of the hangar, spotted, and launched. Meanwhile, Tomonaga's air group would all run out of fuel and crash into the sea. Just there, you lost 97 planes. Also, the strike would have to go unescorted since all the fighters have been brought up to assist in the air defense of the mobile force during the recent attacks. So, the option of launching an unescorted strike, which was bound to receive heavy losses, and lose 97 planes through mass ditching wasn't seriously going to be considered by Nagumo. Basically, it was too late for Nagumo to attack now. He had made his bed and now he had to lay in it. He would have to wait. Thankfully for him, the last morning attacks die down by about 0837. The Kido Butai finally got a break from all the morning attacks and could now begin recovering the aircraft. From 0837 to 0910, Tomonaga's strike force was safely landed. While one can sympathize with the predicament Nagumo is in, there was a decision that was questionable. The Kido Butai changed course to the northeast after recovering the air strike. Why? This was not necessary. Japanese planes out-range the Americans - there was no reason to close the gap. It would just make it quicker for your opponent to reach you. A wiser decision would have been to head northwest, still allowing you to strike back, but keeping you at the extreme striking range of the Americans. With the last of his aircraft recovered, Nagumo was now free to begin spotting his planes on the decks. It was looking good for Nagumo. All he needed now was a 45-minute, uninterrupted window, and a powerful counter-strike will be dealt to the Americans. However, events would soon foil his high hopes. Off to the north, enemy aircraft were spotted. Damn. Instead of preparing to launch a strike, Nagumo would now be forced into evasive maneuvers and focus on protecting his carriers from the forthcoming assault. These 15 Devastator torpedo-bombers were coming in and with no escorts. They would be easy prey for the 30 fighters that were protecting the mobile force. The four carriers turn to port to present their stern to the incoming attackers. What followed next was a stern pursuit which put the Devastators at a disadvantage because of their slow speed. They could barely break 100 knots while carrying their ordnance. The fighters swarmed over them with impunity and they were cut to pieces. Two-thirds were intercepted before they were even close to making their run-ins. Only 3 got close enough to threaten the Soryu, but ultimately, only 1, just 1 of the 15, was able to launch its torpedo. However, not only did his torpedo miss, but the pilot was shot down himself. The attack had lasted about 15 minutes. Although the Japanese probably didn't know it at the moment, they had just destroyed an entire squadron and there were no hits to stand for it. There would only be 1 survivor of the 30 aircrew who participated in this heroic attack. But as soon as that attack was over, at 0940, another one began, this time from the south. It was at this time that Nagumo had to have realized that his mobile force was in serious trouble. It was imperative than Nagumo get his planes off the deck before being hit himself. All he needed was a 45-minute window to launch an airstrike. But, during attacks, he couldn't launch a strike because his flight decks were solely occupied with the replenishment of the Combat Air Patrol fighters. To add to the mess, he was in a dangerous state, because at the moment, he was at his most vulnerable. His planes were fully fueled, armed, and parked densely within the hangars of his carriers. More disturbingly, it was clear that these were carrier-based bombers. Obviously, the reported location of the carriers had been wrong this whole time. They had actually been 55 miles closer when they were spotted at 0728. Thus, his mobile force had been within American strike range this entire time. This is a clear example of the fog of war. Just like at Coral Sea, the Japanese commander had made a decision based on the information at hand, although unbeknownst to him, the information had been incorrect. Sometimes, you can just plain out have bad luck. One thing was for sure, Japanese scout planes needed to practice their ship identification and spotting skills. Oh well, maybe Nagumo can dodge this attack, as well. The 14 torpedo-bombers came in unescorted. The two divisions had selected the Kaga as their target and they were trying to do an anvil attack on the slow carrier. But, it would be difficult to do with their slow lumbering planes. Initially, they came in unopposed, but then, Zeros swarmed over them and the rightmost division took the brunt of the attack. Two torpedoes were launched but the Kaga dodged them. With additional Zeros added to the fray, only 3 torpedoes from the other division were released, but just as before, the Kaga skillfully avoided them, as well. Once again, an attack had been pressed on gallantly by the Americans, but it had been ineffective. 9 of the 14 bombers were shot down and, of these 5 survivors, 1 had to ditch on the return trip. Only 1 Zero was lost. When that attack finished, guess what? Another one began! You have got to be kidding! For the last 50 minutes, these piecemeal attacks, although as ineffective as they were, were delaying the launch of the desperately needed Japanese counter-strike. And, more frightening, judging this to be the third torpedo squadron, there definitely had to be more than one carrier. Actually, there wasn't just one; there were three. Boy, was Nagumo in trouble. Also, the Japanese must have asked themselves at this point: where were the dive-bombers? If the Devastators had made it this far, an imminent dive-bombing attack was sure to come. But something was different with this forthcoming attack. These 12 torpedo-bombers came in with an escort of 6 Wildcats. The Zeros set out to intercept them, but little did they know, they were in for a surprise. For the first time in the war, the famous ""Thach Weave"" was used, named so by its creator, Jimmy Thach, who was leading the division. The planes would start in a Beam Defense Position. Once a Zero was on the tale of a Wildcat, the two sections would turn towards each other. This allowed one section to get a head-on attack on the chasing Zero. It would either kill or brush off the Zeros on your partner's tail. The process could easily be repeated. This defensive maneuver stunned the Zero pilots. Up to this point in the war, the Japanese pilots would always come out victorious in dogfights against their opponents. But now, they were the ones getting beaten. 4 Zeros were shot down and only 1 Wildcat was lost during this interception. Thach, in his fighter squadron alone, attracted the attention of over 20 Zeros. Many things have to be acknowledged at this point. First, the escort had done an excellent job. 11 of the 12 Devastators were actually able to push through for their run-ins and this posed a considerable threat to the carriers. This caused the remaining Zeros, who were looking up for any nearby dive-bombers, to descend from their high altitude patrols to shoot down these intruders. Therefore, as we can see, the northeast sector became a magnet, sucking in all the fighters on Combat Air Patrol. Disturbingly, this had the effect of leaving the carriers with no overhead protection. What we are seeing here is a dangerous example of ""target fixation."" All eyes were glued on this developing threat that the situational awareness, that is keeping a lookout for any other threats, was forgotten. This was leaving the Kido Butai in a vulnerable state. The American bombers carried on, but with fresh Zeros diving from above, the Devastator stood little chance to prevail. The same story played out and over half were shot down. Eventually, only 5 would end up launching at the Hiryu, but the Japanese carrier successfully avoided them. The end result would be that 10 of the 12 torpedo-bombers were lost, and 1 of their 4 escorts, for no hits. This last torpedo attack probably accounted for about seven fighters. The time was 1020. The torpedo attack was halfway through and, as expected, not one had struck home. It was a testament to the prowess of the Japanese pilots. The Kido Butai had been in combat for the last three hours and had avoided all the bombs and torpedoes thrown at it, with its evasive maneuvers and its skilled fighters. Nagumo had been quite lucky, actually. His mobile force, with no radar, had shot down 53 aircraft at this point, and had lost only 11 fighters itself, and there wasn't even a scratch on his ships. But, it was precisely at this moment when all the fighters were down below fighting off this latest assault in the northeast sector that a new threat emerged high above. 50 dive-bombers were approaching overhead, undetected and unopposed, and coming from two different directions Nagumo's luck had finally run out. The Kido Butai had never been faced with defeat before. In the previous 6 months, they had ruled the seas. They had sunk 5 capital ships, a light carrier, 2 cruisers, and half-a-dozen destroyers. But now, their unbroken string of victories would come to an end. These dive-bombers weren't rookies like the Midway-based bombers. These were the ""A-team"" of the Pacific Fleet and, with no opposition, the result would be deadly. From the south came 2 squadrons and they all teamed up on 1 carrier: the enormous Kaga. 30 dive-bombers began their steep dives from 19,000 feet. The Kaga was practically taken by surprise and she received four hits, one of which landed on the bridge, killing the captain and his staff. The planes, being fully fueled and armed inside the hangar, ignited, causing a chain of secondary explosions. She quickly became an inferno. The Soryu was attacked by 13 dive-bombers. 3 bombs were placed evenly along the center her flight deck. All her hangars were hit and, just like the Kaga, the bombs set off a chain of explosions inside the ship. Fires immediately engulfed the carrier. It looked as though the Akagi might get off scot-free. However, when the Kaga was being pummeled, 3 dive-bombers peeled off at the last moment and went for her and, with pure skill, a bomb was dropped in her upper hangar. It didn't seem serious at first. A carrier this big could have certainly survived this single hit. But, just like her sister ships, the planes and bombs inside her hangars began to detonate. Thereafter, fire spread uncontrollably and the Akagi, the flagship of the Kido Butai, was doomed. In less than five minutes, history had changed. The powerful Kido Butai had been wrecked. Only one had been able to escape destruction: the Hiryu. The outcome of the battle now rested upon the shoulders of the Hiryu and her elite pilots."
moonlanding,"In episode 3 of “The Basement Office” the New York Post’s Steven Greenstreet sits down with Nick Pope to discuss the latest UFO sightings and the frightening modern day craft, the black triangle. Is there a Department of Defense cover-up? We speak with witnesses of mass sightings in various locations across the country including the Hudson Valley, New York, and Phoenix, Arizona. Nick reveals why the government downplays such events and offers his take as to whether or not another big wave of UFO sightings is on the horizon.

mechanical as if there was an intelligence behind it while reports of flying saucers dominated UFO sightings for an entire generation today there's a new type of craft that seems to be threatening our skies it's fast its mysterious and to me it's a lot more frightening than its predecessor it's the black triangle this is the basement office and again we're here joined by Nick Pope the Fox Mulder of Great Britain let's talk about the triangles now when do these things start popping up there are some reports going back as far as the fifties but really the modern black triangle flying triangle mystery really takes off I guess in the 80s we have witness reports throughout the 60s and 70s but they're sporadic and then as you would say on come the waves and that brings us to 1980 and the now-infamous Rendlesham forest triangle it's been cold Britain's Roswell and these are military personnel US Air Force personnel go into the forest to investigate lights and they see this I think they estimated 10 9 10 foot black solid black triangle and it levitates and this thing unlike most UFOs actually landed so he really did get up close and personal with it Rendlesham of course you could write a whole book about in fact you did write a whole book about Rendlesham our next episode actually is going to focus completely on this crazy incident but for sake of this episode we're going to move on and chronologically follow this triangle around the world the next and chronologically speaking seem to be the Hudson Valley sightings sure the Hudson Valley sightings are really bizarre but unlike Rendlesham this thing is much bigger I mean we're talking here some of the witnesses will talk about these things being the size of football fields but hovering or moving very slowly in the sky and then accelerating away to the horizon an incredible rate thousands of witnesses describe seeing massive objects in the sky outlined by colorful lights but I Skype with one of the few who managed to film what she saw we were actually going eastbound when we saw this thing in the sky so when we got home we thought we lost it and my husband went to let the dog out and he called me and he said you got to see this come out here it's back so when we saw this object in the sky we the first thing we do is we're training and grab the video camera and just started taking images of it it was a ring of lights we could not see through the lights were actually you can see by a naked eye you can't see in the video of a gap right - actually turning they were turning to the left and they started changing colors as they turned while many accounts describe v-shaped or boomerang shaped objects Lori says she saw it from a different perspective way people are describing is based on where they were standing some people were standing directly underneath it so could it have been of type shape formation or boomerang shape it's possible yes from where I was standing I was more east of the object so I could have been looking at it from a different angle it's constant it's night after night week after week month after month of the same thing correct yes and people are beginning to think why aren't the authorities doing something or maybe the authorities know all about this and maybe there's nothing they can do but the people there feel as if they're under siege from what I understand of the Hudson Valley wave people are calling 911 calling airports and police officers are showing up and seeing these things also and reporting that they have seen these things yes you think that the police are going to turn up and be the ones to debunk this but as you say that the police turn up and hey if there's this huge great thing just hanging in the sky of course they're gonna see it too and that's why yes we have many many police witnesses did the government ever come out investigate say anything the problem with all this is at the time we were in that era where the official position of the US government was we don't investigate UFOs we now know with the revelations about the Pentagon's a tip program that was probably not entirely correct however the government was in a very difficult position in the 80s if they turned out overtly and if investigator turned up started interviewing witnesses on the doorstep making paper trail of government documents they would have basically blown their own position out of the water so if there was government investigation it went on behind closed doors so one from the Army had come to my house to investigate the tape to make sure that the tape was authentic and it was not something that we made up or we created is it possible that what you filmed that night was a formation of planes planes or flares nope it's not something they've never seen before the constant frustrating thing for me is to read about these cases to read the police reports the official reports the photographs and to see complete inaction and almost they go out of the way to show their disinterest in something so massive and that's freaking people out their citizens are scared of this yes and I was part of that same policy in the UK consistently we downplay the true extent the very large extent of our own interest and involvement in this subject the answer to the question that you know why why aren't people doing more what are the government going to do is they can't stop it they don't know what it is they can't do anything about it and no government would ever come out overtly and say there's something in our skies it's faster than us it's more maneuverable than us we chase them we can't catch them we track them on radar we have no idea sorry no government can that's not terrible but you you just said that you were you played a role in downplaying due to the public yes something would happen and it was your role to downplay it to the people right sadly yeah no we're part Mulder and cigarette smoke I yes I I had this kind of split identity I guess but it was government policy and you know somewhere in those x-files there are even some papers that come out and say this it was consistently UK government policy to downplay this subject partly as I say it's just the sheer embarrassment of saying there are things in our airspace and we don't know what they are let's jump across the Atlantic from the Hudson Valley at the Belgium in nineteen ninety another wave of triangles hits Belgium sure actually from eighty nine through to ninety and culminating on one particular night there is this wave of sightings and when I say wave let me just contextualize this and talking about hundreds of sightings over a period of just a few months in a very small when you think about it in global terms geographical area so this wave of sightings with many of the witnesses being police officers for example I've seen reports of police officers on patrol jumping into their car trying to chase some object that they've seen picking up the phone calling the airforce saying what's going on in our skies and then there's this one night March 30th late on March 30th early hours March 31st 1990 a huge triangular UFO is seen over large parts of Belgium the Belgian Air Force track it on radar on both the Belgium national radar system and that's part of the wider NATO integrated air defense system they scramble two f-16 fighter interceptors those jets go up the pilots get a lock on to this object with their airborne radar so it's been trapped on the ground in the air the pilots are repeatedly vectored towards this UFO and every time they get close the UFO breaks the radar lock moves the pilots have to reacquire it and a game of virtual cat-and-mouse takes place in the skies over Belgium at what point is that famous photo taken underneath now that I believe was taken at some stage on that particular night I I don't know at exactly what time and actually the original photo is quite dark but when you try and touch it up a little craft seems to emerge out of the darkness the main thing that I take away from Belgium before we move on is of all the people in different places there who saw something many of them were either interviewed as to draw something this person over here in this person and when you look at the collection of drawings and sketches and descriptions it's eerily similar absolutely it is the same craft and by the way I I have spoken to the Belgian general wilfred de Brouwer who led the official investigation into this and he talked me through this in great detail and also when I was at the Ministry of Defence doing the job on the UFO program we made inquiries of the Belgians through our embassy and we spoke to general Dubrow we spoke to the two f-16 pilots the official conclusion of the Belgian government this is was they came out and said so is this was real and we have no idea what it was approximately 140 UFO sightings were reported hundreds of people saw a majestic triangular craft with a span of approximately hundred and twenty feet powerful beaming spotlights moving very slowly without making any significant noise but in several cases accelerating to very high speeds and short the Belgian UFO wave was exceptional and the Air Force could not identify the nature origin and intentions of the reported phenomenon thank you very much and it's the Belgian government officially on the record publicly it's like that's a UFO yes there are Declassified Belgian Air Force documents that set all this out there's a I've read into the Belgian wave we're not going to go any further into it but I suggest anyone watching there are some crazy details behind these sightings jump back across the Atlantic Arizona 97 now I know the Phoenix lights one of the most famous bulk wave sightings ever dude these lights belong to visitors from outer space hundreds of people across the valley think it's a distinct possibility eyewitnesses who saw it say it's like nothing they've ever seen before UFO watchers are calling it a dramatic event and folks who witnessed this strange sighting are calling it simply unexplainable so I did I did a Skype interview with dr. Lynn khatai who took video footage of the Phoenix lights and it's this footage has been used everywhere it's famous footage and this is what she has to say about it the first time I had an experience with the Phoenix lights this was less than a hundred yards from our home and it was a uniform amber color throughout and it didn't glare at all every other light out there glared and as we both watched the top or without budget from the other two underneath started to implode it's very difficult to describe in logical terms because it's like a dimmer switch it was mechanical as if there was an intelligence behind it and got smaller and smaller slowly getting smaller and smaller till it was pea sized and then disappeared nothing even remotely similar to these orbs showed up for two years until two months before the mass sighting this was January 1997 I noticed three huge words but at a distance so I ran downstairs I grabbed my video camera I get out to the pool area I kind of up to 18 seconds work and the battery went dead and it was fully charged I run in I grab my 35 millimeter I run it outside on the balcony as I'm ready to shoot the three suddenly six lights across equidistant from each other massive span over a mile wide pops up over the three it was unnerving and when analyzed and all my photographic evidence was analyzed extensively by University and military optical experts and the conclusion were that these lights were true unknown that whatever I capture on a 35 millimeter to this day cannot be explained or denied and many people in March 13th 1997 thousands of people saw actual craft I spoke to a witness who and I said to try and get a sense of this well how big was this thing and how low was it and he said to me Nick if I had thrown a rock at I would have hit the underside of it everyone was just stopped cars were pulled up they were looking out they were pointing and so for every witness we have we have like dozens if not hundreds there are probably hundreds if not thousands more who saw it but who have never come forward officially and gone on the record years later the governor himself comes out to admit that he also this is of course once once he's retired and it won't kill his career comes out and says yeah I also saw it that night I saw a triangular craft I saw something that defied logic and challenged my reality I witnessed a massive delta-shaped craft that silently navigated over the  Peak area in North Phoenix in the evening and it was truly breathtaking and it was just such a cool moment for those other witnesses to have their former governor kind of backed them up it was but of course that's quite controversial because at the time he treated it like a joke he treated it like a joke he did a press conference him and what he did is I said we have identified the culprit and he had his chief of staff come out dressed in an alien suit don't get him too close to me please this just goes to show that you guys are entirely too serious well of course it got a laugh and and the media then treated it as a joke he subsequently apologized for that he said frankly the only reason he did that is he was worried that the whole situation was descending into almost mass hysteria we managed to lessen the sense of panic at the time but I also upset quite a few of my constituents well I'd like now to set the record straight I never meant to ridicule anyone my office did make enquiries as to the origin of the craft but to this day they remain unanswered has there ever been an official statement some of the military I believe put out a statement to say that there had been maybe some military exercise going on involving aircraft dropping flares flares right the military says the lights over Arizona last night were flares but the people who saw the lights last night say they couldn't have been flares the lights were tube light correct me if I'm wrong because a year investigate these things but flares they fall yeah and then the wind separates them and what we're observing in the Phoenix lights are lights that are consistent distance from each other and they don't deviate so one theory about the the aircraft is that of course those aircraft would have been scrambled as we know military jets are often scrambled to investigate the UFOs so yeah I'm not saying that there were no aircraft there and maybe some of them later around 10:00 in the evening dropped flares but because they too were part of maybe an operation to try and find out what the heck this thing was and this takes us later to Illinois in Saint st. Clair Illinois in 2000 where we see very similar triangles to the Phoenix lights okay so I actually Skyped with David Marlar who literally wrote the book on angular UFOs I did a Skype interview with him here's some things that he had to say tell me about st. Claire Illinois in 2000 and over the road truck driver was coming home late one morning he happens to see this extremely bright light off to the north-northeast within a matter of a few minutes as he's sitting there this light which is obviously now as it comes closer is a light affixed to a large object silently very gently floats over the tree line and he notices it slowly disappeared to the southwest he immediately notifies the police of what he had just witnessed they weren't sure if he was altogether there reporting a UFO but he was very emphatic that if you contact Lebanon Illinois police they should see it because it was basically that trajectory which is the direction was heading in they contact officer had barton and he's making a joke about it initially we have the dispatch tapes where you can hear the officers talking to each other but very shortly his skepticism erodes the object came directly overhead and what he witness was a large essentially isosceles triangle the object as it's hovering there made a flat turn like that it didn't Bank like conventional aircraft we have a large turn radius made a flat turn executed that maneuver and then rapidly accelerated in the blink of an eye to the southwest he immediately gets on the radio states well whatever it is it seems to be headed towards Shiloh which was the direction of the next neighboring town in that direction and the other officer in Shiloh states immediately yeah I see it but I don't know what the heck it is so we have these officers in radio contact as they're visually tracking this object and it was then a sighted subsequent to that by two other police officers and another officer that came forward later and we were able to establish the flight path of this UFO it was most witnesses described at this triangular in shape with various lighting characteristics but all of them with the exception of one state it was completely silent one officers said he thought for the lightning or droning sound with the object but highly unusual what's interesting about the case is the caliber of the witnesses the fact that it flew in very close proximity to Scott Air Force Base to than one to two miles yet Scott Air Force Base denied any knowledge of it we have an official statement that they weren't testing or supporting the test of any aircraft in that area at that time the radar system was down so we didn't have a radar data associated with that the the ability for this object to hover rapidly accelerate and do so with the complete absence of a sonic boom is highly suggested that this is someone else's technology and four years later there was another mass sighting in Illinois so we have the footage this but basically in Tinley Park on more than one night a large triangular formation of Lights is seen over the city videotaped by residents when they zoom in on the lights the lights give off a cherry red with almost it looks like a rainbow of lights spinning in each of these things and again I think to the naked eye these look like three individual things as I think people saw the Phoenix lights as individual little lights what we're looking at very often with these triangular UFOs is a flat triangle with the witnesses essentially being underneath it you're suggesting that these are actually attached on the corners of a craft yes you're looking at three lights at each tip of the triangle and very often and it's interesting we see this with with Tinley Park I think a hint of a fainter maybe whiter light bang in the center of the underside of this thing now are any of these things navigation lights and in which case would why would they need lights or are they connected as many believe with the propulsion system of this UFO in this age where everyone's got a cellphone that shoots 4k video in their pocket where are the Phoenix lights now where are the Tinley Park lights where are the Hudson Valley lights now would be a great time to get them on cell phone video or something now where'd they go or are we due for a return this is an event sled phenomenon and I think your your second point was probably the answer we are overdue for a hue mass sighting and in this modern age with ubiquitous cell phones and things yes if something on the scale of Hudson Valley or Phoenix lights happens today it will be undeniable there will be hundreds if not thousands of high quality photos and videos nobody will be able to deny it and maybe just maybe it will push the whole question over the line it will it will take us from a situation where we have evidence to a situation where we have absolutely definitive proof well I can't wait neck I don't know who knows it could it could be awhile it could be next week it could be tonight that's why I say this is event it's led you just never know when the next absolutely mega case is gonna hit you may have another Roswell tomorrow you may have another Hudson Valley the day after you may have another Rendlesham next week now what I haven't told you yet is that I've actually seen one of these black triangles and in the next episode I'm going to share my personal encounter with you
moonlanding,"Tic Tac UFO

November 2004, 90 miles of the coast of Mexico near San Diego, California, the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was conducting routine training and aerial defense exercises when unexplained events occurred. No one could have predicted what would soon confront the world's most advanced naval war ships and fighter jets.  Aerial craft would appear that forever changed all those that encountered them. The answers to the question of “what are they?” remains unanswered by the sailors and the US Gov. After years of cloaked secrecy the true story can finally be told. With multiple witnesses from the ships, their first hand testimony is impossible to deny. 
Our film features CGI re-creations as told by the sailors and naval aviators that witnessed them. Aside from the historical fictionalized dialog (no one recorded the radio conversations), the story itself is based on the facts of the case, including official US government docs, witness statements, news reports and official timelines. See www.thenimitzencounters.com for links to the official documents.

 Nevada's badlands stretches endlessly to the horizon. Hidden within these mountain strongholds are some of America's
 deepest and darkest secrets. Secret aircraft and the
 other legends of Area 51. Among these sandstone canyons today there's a new glimmer of truth. Shrouded in mystery it's a
 story that demands to be told. These are the witnesses of
 one of America's most unusual UFO encounters in history. Navy veterans and a band of brothers that want you to know that
 what they witnessed is real. This is their story. Petty Officer Jason Turner server aboard the USS Princeton in 2004. His personal conviction for
 democracy and patriotism guides him in his search for the truth. - This is an actual event that happened and I witnessed it. Aviation tech Patrick Hughes, a USS Nimitz veteran, he
 speaks for his shipmates who choose to remain silent. - I'm one of those who
 has to see to believe and obviously I've seen
 the evidence of this so it exists. - Top Gun Air Intercept
 Controller Kevin Day and Fire Controlman Gary
 Voorhis, both from the Princeton, served together in the ship's
 Combat Information Center. They saw them first. Whatever it is they are. - They wanted to show
 themselves, whatever they were. I don't think they wanted
 anything really to do with us. - They were literally
 breaking the laws of physics in my eyes. These sailors are here
 for truth and vindication. And their story goes back over
 a decade to a time and place that marked a departure for all of them, both in their Navy careers,
 but also in their knowledge of the limits of man's technological understanding of our world. (dramatic instrumental) Looking out over the
 ocean towards the horizon, sun, sea, and sky form an endless vista. A never-ending cycle of
 tide, wind, and waves. Here, far from shore strange
 events have unfolded. These stories stretch the
 boundaries of our imagination and challenge our beliefs. This is a true story of such
 events from the accounts of the sailors and naval
 aviators who experienced them, professional military service
 members who want the world to know that what they
 encountered is real. Even more troubling, our
 military has no explanation. The answers seem to elude everyone, like reflections on the waves. Yet, they are out there. (jets blasting) November 10th, 2004. 90 miles Southwest of San Diego California in the Naval Operations Area, the Nimitz Carrier Strike
 Group and her compliment of warships and the
 aircraft of Air Wing 11, are conducting a routine,
 two-week training exercise. Nearby, the guided missile cruiser, USS Princeton has been
 tracking unknown aircraft that appear and disappear
 from her sophisticated AEGIS radar screens. The SPY1 Bravo radar is
 one of the most advanced sensors ever deployed. Princeton's main role is air
 defense of the Strike Group and Operations Specialist Senior Chief Day is in charge of protecting the
 airspace around the Nimitz. - And my job was to man the
 radars and ID everything that flew in the skies. And I also sat a position
 called anti air warfare coordinator where if we
 ever had to go to war, I was the guy who was going to launch the missiles and kill shit. In addition to that, I was
 an air intercept controller when the Super Hornet is
 taking off the carrier, I'm the guy that takes control and takes them to the fight
 and get 'em some home safe. There was a lot of
 experience in that room. The captain had 28 years, I had 18 years, and the AEGIS ship is our
 newest weapons system afloat. And it's got the spy one radar system, a phased array radar system. And I was an expert on that. - Inside the Combat Information Center Chief Day's attention is
 focused on a group of unknown aircraft on the Spy 1 screen. He's trying to identify them. - I was on watch and we
 were probably 100 miles, I forget how far exactly that day we were off the coast of
 San Diego, south southwest. Kind of off the coast of Mexico, Baja. And I started to notice,
 these weird tracks that were popping under my
 radar coverage right around San Clemente island. And the reason why I say there
 are weird because they were appearing in groups of
 five to 10 at a time and they were pretty closely
 spaced to each other. And they were 28,000 feet going a hundred knots tracking south. And in the back of my mind
 I'm thinking, you know, that's Kinda odd. I mean, what, I don't know
 anything that flies like that. They weren't on the COMAIR routes, the commercial airline routes. I wasn't really that concerned about it and I didn't consider them them hostile for any reason at all. Another watcher too as I'm
 watching the same formation appeared again and over the
 course of three, four days probably counted up to that
 point groups of five to 10 at a time, there were probably
 50, 60 tracks by then. - Today Kevin and Gary are
 still looking for answers. They've known each other for over a decade since their Navy days. Gary was a 3rd Class Petty Officer and Fire Controlman back then. - I worked on the AEGIS computer system on a CG 59 guided missile
 cruiser at USS Princeton. I'm in charge of CEC and a
 data recording and maintaining and operating all the
 mainframes that run the system. - They're both becoming
 increasingly frustrated in their attempts to ID
 the strange aerial objects, which have no transponders, and fit no known flight profiles. - The guys that work
 on Spy one Bravo radar, they had come across and said
 they needed to take the system down for recalibration cause
 they were getting a clutter or ghost tracks and they
 needed to recalibrate to get rid of them. And then once they did finish
 all that recalibration, bring it the tracks didn't disappear. They were still there,
 but they were actually sharper and clearer. - They were doing diagnostic
 tests on everything we had to make sure it was
 not a system malfunction and it turned out that it wasn't, these were actually real objects. I had the highest SPY
 track quality possible on these contacts. - In this situation I
 actually started recording on all four tapes at the same time. That way it was at one
 continuous loop and I was just replacing them as they were becoming full. - We failed utterly to
 identify these things. It didn't meet any of the
 parameters for anything that was known. - In some cases, they seem
 to descend from space, and then suddenly plunge to
 near sea level in seconds. Coupled with the unidentified
 nature of the craft and lack of clearance, these
 extreme flight observations are very troubling to the
 crew assigned to protect the carrier group from aerial threats. Sunday Nov 14th, morning. The Nimitz deck crew is busy launching F/A-18F Super Hornets, helicopters and E2-Hawekeye Electronic Warfare Planes. The mission? Simulated air defense, or ADEX
 training over the Pacific. The winds are calm, the skies are clear, a near perfect day for flying. As they launch, the Black Aces Squadron has no knowledge of
 events happening nearby. - In the back of my mind,
 that's when I determined I was going to become
 concerned about these objects. We were getting ready to launch
 a whole bunch of aircraft in that same piece of sky. - Fast Eagle climbs
 out to 20 thousand feet and heads to the CAP station, about 40 miles south of the carrier. The CAP is a rendezvous
 point used to form up with the other airplanes. - There's 25 miles separation. - The commander of Fast
 Eagle has over a decade in the Air Wing. His wingman for the day is a new pilot, a young officer on her
 first carrier deployment. She's paired with a senior pilot, her backseat weapon's system
 officer for the mission. He will manage navigation
 and the advanced radar and targeting pods on the aircraft. (jets blasting) Overhead, an E2 Hawkeye from
 the Wall Bangers squadron is on station directing the aircraft. Banger provides eye in the
 sky command and control during carrier flight operations. Back in the Combat Information
 Center on Princeton the mysterious objects are back
 and today is the first time Senior Chief Day has jets in the air that can intercept the
 mysterious aircraft. - I'm seeing these contacts. Captain Smith orders me
 to intercept one of them so I just want back to the console, I pick the closest one that was to us, and I had intended to let
 the Hawkeye do the intercept because they already had control. It's just easier. - Day briefs the Captain and they agree to send the Hornets. The Air Intercept
 Controller aboard Princeton, Callsign Charlie radios the Hawkeye and takes control of Fast Eagle. - Banger, it's Charlie. - Charlie this is Banger, go ahead. - Banger to Charlie, do you
 hold unknown air contact BRA 270 48 28,000 feet at Bogey. - Charlie to Banger, negative. Radar picture's clean. - The E-2 radar operators
 have been frustrated in their attempts to get a
 radar return on the unknown aerial target that Princeton is tracking. Even with their 24-foot radar dish, they can't get a lock on the object. - Banger to Charlie, transfer Fast Eagles flight
 to Charlie control, button 13. - We have a Real World Tasking for them. - Charlie to Banger, Roger. - Fast Eagle Charlie, stand
 by For Real World Tasking. - Charlie Fast Eagle, send it. - We vector towards
 that position in the sky and real quiet on the radio, I'm just giving him, BRA calls, which is bearing, range, altitude to these unknown bogey
 groups and basically I'm just telling the air
 crew where the object is, the bearing from them
 and the range from them and the altitudes so they
 can drive towards it. - Contact BRA 270 41 20,000 feet Bogey Snap 270. Over. - Roger Bearing 270 41 miles. - 100 go trail. - 100. - Say state? - State 12,000 pounds. Clean, do you have it? - I'm trying to get a track on it now. They sent LINK 16, but my
 radar picture is clean. - The next radio call
 takes everyone by surprise. - Fast Eagle 110, say load out. 110 what's you weapons load out? - The tactical action officer, the TAO, jumps on the radio, her
 name was Lieutenant Elders and she just point blank
 asked the Fast Eagle flight if they were carrying any type of weapons and there was a stunned
 pause on the radio. - Wings clean Princeton. We just have CATM training missiles and they're not coming off the rail. - We're in an exercise environment and the last thing we wanted
 to do is start shooting stuff. - Now the controllers have the
 pilot's undivided attention. Normally, the squadron doesn't carry live ordinance when training. - What do you guys think that was about? - What, about the load out? I have no idea. Maybe it's drug runners or something? - Man it could be, or a
 lost Cessna out of So-cal. - I don't like this. - Fast Eagle Charlie, contact BRA 160 34. At 8,000 feet, Bogey. (dramatic music)
 (jets blasting) - Roger, 34 miles at 8,000. Committed, your call, continuing. - As Fast Eagle approaches the target, they see nothing unusual. Their onboard radars can't
 get a lock on the object. - Fast Eagle Charlie
 BRA 160 10 8,000 feet. - Roger. (dramatic music) - Fast Eagle Charlie. Merge plot. - Basically what the merge
 plot means on the radar. You got two objects in the
 same vertical piece of sky. So when I'm looking at the 2D display, it looks like one radar blob now. - The object appears to be stationary. - I had it at 17.7k - Showing there's basically
 no air speed on it. - Hey, you guys seeing this? - What is that? - As the Super Hornets
 approach the target, they see a disturbance
 on the ocean surface; it's about the size of a 737, and it looks like something
 could be just below the surface. - 100 Anchor here. Angels 24. - Roger. - Charlie Fast Eagle. - We're observing something in the water. Possibly aircraft in the
 water at the merge plot just north of our
 position about two miles. - Charlie, Roger. - I'm descending to
 angels 14 to take a look. - Do you think that's our unknown? - Not sure. Radar's clean. - As soon as he got to
 the merge plot position, the object that he was intercepting
 dropped from 28,000 feet down to 50 feet above
 the water in 0.78 seconds as I found out later the next day. - As the Super Hornets get
 closer to the ocean disturbance he suddenly spots another craft above it. A much smaller white object
 with an oblong shape, hovering then darting
 just above the waves. The object is moving around erratically, seemingly focused on the white water. The shape is similar to a Tic Tac. It's smooth like porcelain. It's not an airplane. Suddenly the object begins
 to rise into the air. (dramatic music) - Hey this thing just turned on my nose. It's Coming up! 2 miles. - The strange craft begins mirroring the turn rate of Fast Eagle. - Tally one bogey 287 two miles. Angels 5. - The object is now at
 his three o'clock position as he continues to turn with it. - He's turning hard at 3000 meters. - We had the external
 communications in the speaker in combat so everyone can listen to it. And the next thing I
 hear on the radio going, oh my god, oh my god,
 I'm engaged, I'm engaged! - 1000 meters he's southbound. We need to avoid it. (dramatic music) - The commander is now about a mile away as he maneuvers his hornet to
 get behind the unknown craft. It's about the size of an F-18, about 47 feet long and it has no wings. As the dogfight unfolds, he quickly turns and dives
 to bring his jet's nose ahead of the object to close the distance. - Holy! - It jumped! - 1000 meters he's... (dramatic intense music) I lost him! Two do you see it? - Suddenly the Tic Tac rockets past. It's gone beyond the horizon
 in the blink of an eye. - I saw it go 137. No tally. - That didn't just happen. - Say again. - Fast Eagle Charlie, sir
 you're not going to believe this but the bogey group is now
 back at your cap station, over. - As Fast Eagle returns to the area of the ocean disturbance, the
 object is gone and the sea is once again calm. Soon they land on the ship. (jet engines) Back onboard Banger, the
 flight crew has been listening to the radio transmissions
 from Fast Eagle. The crew has been tracking the intercepts on their advanced display
 systems, called the CEC. One of the radar operators
 who wishes to remain anonymous describes hearing the fear
 in the pilot's voices, and he knows this is no drill. - I had a good friend
 who flew on the Hawkeyes. We've been calling him Roger, to protect his identity
 because he didn't want to come forward at this time but
 he wanted to contribute to the story to verify
 that it actually happened. So there are five people in the airplane. Roger would've been sitting
 in the radar officer's seat which is toward the
 back middle of the plane to the side of each one of
 them or behind them depending how the chairs rotating as a window. - Suddenly, his attention
 is drawn to something outside the Hawkeye. He and the entire crew watch in disbelief as a Tic Tac object suddenly
 forms up on their E2 and then just as quickly
 shoots away from sight. The crew is left in disbelief. As Banger returns to the
 ship, the crew is shaken. The highly unusual events are troubling, but what happens next has
 haunted them to this day. US Navy officers quickly
 arrive and escort the air crew to a secure space on the ship. As the crewmen begin to
 take off their flight gear, an officer begins the
 debriefing by telling them, this event did not happen and they are given non-disclosure
 agreements to sign. They are warned to never
 discuss this event again. (dramatic music) - Again we we're preparing
 air defense exercise so now we got all the squadrons
 launching off the carrier 'cause they're all up getting
 to do their functional check flights. - Senior Chief Day watched in
 disbelief as the Tic Tac UFOs reacted to the incoming fighter jets. - All the objects in the
 sky, they all dropped out of the sky from 28,000
 feet down to 50 feet. - Based on the SPY1 Bravo Radar system the object descended at
 over 24,000 miles an hour. - It was unbelievable because
 normally what would happen if a normal aircraft
 did that, first of all it would fly apart, it
 wouldn't be able to withstand the G forces and there would
 be multiple sonic booms. So it would be boom boom,
 boom boom boom boom boom boom. This did not make any sonic booms. - From what I observed, I saw
 that it went from, you know, right around between 25 and
 30,000 feet down to sea level and below sea level. - Contact. Tag number 042-- - Below sea level was
 confirmed to me by the actual sonar techs that were in
 combat in communications with other techs that had
 said they had an active track on it under the water. - They're talking with
 their sonar guys on the sub that was with us, you
 know, and I mean I was told directly that it did go
 underwater, you know, I mean it went from being
 in the air to underwater. From what they were
 saying it was averaging about 500 knots under the water, you know, so it did slow down when it hit that water but it didn't affect it inertially. - After the intercepts,
 both Kevin and Gary climbed up to the ships
 bridge wing to get a better view of the objects
 through the binoculars. - We go up to the bridge
 wing and look at them through the big eyes, which is a
 heavily magnified binoculars that are out on the
 bridge wing of the ship. - Even when I was off watch
 I was usually up in combat anyway and I was sitting at
 the console, I just picked the closest object to us
 and I got the relative bearing from the ship. Slave over to the
 relative bearing of about the right altitude and then saw
 this white light in the sky. - The movements were
 smooth to erratic, yeah. They just moved from one point to another. It was always a very
 sharp and clean movement. It always felt like a constant
 speed, not like speeding up. Just, it needed to go to
 that point and it decided to do it at this speed
 and then it would just go from nothing to the speed
 they were going to go and then stop at the next point. - Meanwhile, back on the Nimitz, aviation tech Patrick Hughes is working to secure the classified data
 recorders from the Hawkeye that encountered the Tic Tac. - We pull out the hard drives. We call them RMCs. We call them bricks 'cause
 they're physically heavy like a brick but they
 contain the software to run the airplane and they also record a lot of the data that the air
 crew sees during the flight. So we take the removable
 stuff, we take it out, we go downstairs, back to our shop. - Patrick's job involves
 tracking the chain of custody of the hard drives. - Then we open up the
 safe, put them in a safe, we've got tracking sheets so we know what RMCs or what airplane. We know who signed them out,
 who put them in the airplane, who took him out of the airplane. - As he gets ready to wrap up the mission, there is a knock on the door. - Our commanding officer's there. Two other guys in flight
 suits who I'm assuming were air force officers 'cause pretty sure that's the insigma they had on, but they were not on the ship earlier. I did not seem them come on the ship, so I'm not sure how they got there. But the skipper basically
 said I need the bricks off the flight. We open the safe, we put them
 in the bags, he took them, he took his two anonymous
 officers and left. - The officers, with the
 classified hard drives in hand, soon board an SH-60 Seahawk
 Helicopter and leave Nimitz. (helicopter propellers spinning) Soon thereafter, Petty Officer Voorhis has his own visit by unknown
 officials on the Princeton. - Once they landed and everybody
 got off then about maybe 20 minutes later I got
 called in to have all my data recording tapes turned over and
 then also told that I needed to reload CEC 'cause it had been wiped. So I turned over all the
 tapes and then they also said if there's any even blank
 tapes to erase anything else that's in the shop. Well they were plain-clothes
 people that came on board on the helicopter. It was my chain of command, that took control of the tapes from me. The Helo left with them after that. So, cause we went right
 back to flight ops. - The link between the Tic
 Tacs and these men is unknown. How they became aware
 of the UFO encounters and how they arrived so quickly onboard after the event is also a mystery. - The video you are now watching
 is the actual gun camera FLIR footage of the Tic Tac
 taken by a later flight. This is the first video ever
 released by the US Government showing military planes engaging UFO's. The advanced targeting
 pod, known as ATFLIR, works in both TV mode and infrared mode. The film reveals no control
 surfaces, no exhaust plume, a uniform heat signature and
 no visible means of propulsion. Gary and his shipmates saw the
 FLIR film on their consoles and on the secret LAN
 aboard the Princeton. - It was a much clearer video. You could see the shape of
 the ship, you could see it, you know, moving. I tried to go and get a disc
 to come make a copy of it and by the time I got
 back it was already off of our hard drive, off the secret LAN. Yeah, no access to it whatsoever. - Petty Officer Jason Turner
 also saw a much higher resolution version of the
 FLIR film showing strange appendages extending from the object. - But it did have some
 protruding at the bottom of it. I couldn't tell if they were
 curled back or straight down. - Jason says the video was
 approximately 10 minutes in length and much longer than the video that has been released. - I saw this video
 playing and I'd ask him, is this what we're training
 or was this part of this training that we're going
 through and he said, no, this is real life and when I saw it, it was a very clear
 image, a very clear video, and this thing was going
 berserk, like making turns like it's incredible. The amount of G forces that
 it would put on a human that this thing was doing. The jets were like trying
 to trail this thing and it would just run off and leave them. It would just pfft gone
 and then it would come back and then you would see it. And then it, I mean, it
 was, it made a maneuver, like they were chasing it straight on. It was going with them. This thing stopped
 turning, just pew, gone. I mean, that's the only way to
 describe what it looked like. - This is a fucking droilet bro. - There's a whole fleet of them. - My gosh. - Just 11 years later, fighter
 jets from USS Roosevelt filmed this anomalous object in 2015. - Look at that thing! It's levitating. - Like the Nimitz Encounter, they too were conducting routine training when fleets of UFO's were
 encountered by the pilots. The Nimitz encounter
 remained cloaked secrecy for over 13 years. The first hand testimony
 about UFO sightings is practically unheard of
 from military service members. Thanks to the brave and
 honest accounts of the sailors and naval aviators who
 have come forward to relate their experiences, and
 of the remarkable videos they filmed that day, the
 silence has been broken. - I dealt with this all on
 my own for many, many years. And it was not a very pleasant
 journey to go through. 'Cause no one really believes you. But now things have changed
 and anyone out there that's struggling with this
 and wants to reach out, there is now a group
 that you can reach out to and get help and support and vindication. - It's honestly been a
 little relieving to be able to talk about it and how
 important that event really was and not just keep blowing it off. There's people out here that, you know, really need to know and want to know and you have the support
 of, you know, me and Kevin and my other shipmates
 that have come forward and decided to talk about it. - My role is to describe the
 story and convince people that yes, this event really
 happened and these objects were really real, but what
 they are, I have no idea. - It is something, I
 want to know what it is. That's the whole reason
 I chose to come forward to contribute to this story
 because there is a story here, there is more information here and more of us that talk
 about it, the better chance of the full story coming together. And it's almost, it's vindication for us that other people are
 looking into it and you know, we finally tell our
 story and people listen. - If you need to get ahold of us or would like to talk to any of us, Kevin, me or any of the other
 guys that have come forward there'll be an email address
 at the end of this video that you can contact them
 and they can get ahold of us. - If you or someone you
 know has witnessed unknown objects from military ships or planes, please contact us at the
 address on your screen. You can remain anonymous. As we strive to understand
 these encounters and come to terms with what they mean, there's something far beyond
 the horizon and the limits of our comprehension waiting,
 waiting for all of us. (dramatic music)"

Because I don't want you to suffer the embarrassment of exercising phone manners from yesteryear, here are the proper phone etiquette guidelines for 2018.",Phone Etiquette in 2018 - Ultra Spiritual Life episode 91,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Et--uvozgUM,0,388772,11073,153,791,Et--uvozgUM,this is a special announcement I don't want you to fall prey to lousy phone etiquette and suffer from social embarrassment so I've documented for you the unwritten rules about proper phone etiquette in 2018 text before you call it's a violation when you call someone without texting first to let them know you're gonna call and you're clearly confused about what a phone is for if you think you can just call someone on it you wouldn't just walk through someone's front door without knocking first so have some respect and text before you call silence your ringer in public do you know what a first degree phone felony is having your ringer on in public it's not 1999 anymore where you having a ringing phone in public means you're an important person in 2018 it means you're so unimportant that you rarely get calls and therefore haven't had a chance to catch on to the fact that your ringing phone is auditorily obnoxious to everyone but you so keep your ringer off it's worse than the secondhand smoke never proofread speech to text conversion the best minds in IT make it possible for you to convert your speech into written text with an impressive 11 percent accuracy rate while they've yet to develop a higher rate of accuracy you've yet to develop the ability to proofread your text before you send them as it should be just six cucumbers would be awesome period trying to decipher what your text is actually trying to say is a mental challenge the other person always enjoys use the speakerphone when talking to someone you don't like the speakerphone is a function designed by engineers to frustrate the person you're talking to by inundating them with an embrace of Orchestra comprised of 47% background noise 35% eardrum piercing sounds like cars going by and 18% your voice decline calls carefully when a phone etiquette offender does call you without texting first you're obviously going to decline the call but how you decline the call makes all the difference do not press the red decline button if you do then they'll know you sent them straight to voicemail and that you don't want to talk to them instead do a single click of your sleep button your phone stops ringing on your end but it keeps ringing on their end they'll be left thinking that you didn't just reject them and you'll be left wearing the crown of phone-based psychological manipulation talk in a normal volume if you start talking on the phone and automatically double the volume of your voice the only thing you're helping is everyone around you realize how ignorant you are you may not realize this but the exact reason why you don't need to yell for the other person to hear you is because you're talking to them on a phone because you obviously didn't get an advanced degree in awareness it'll help you to know that with today's phones the other person can hear you better than if you were talking to them in person so quiet down leave voice texts not voicemails there's no way in hell anybody's gonna check a voicemail you leave it's too inconvenient it shows up in a part of their phone that might as well be a thousand miles away it's just rude to leave one instead send them a voice message via text they'll be happy to listen to it because it's completely different and then they'll probably resent you because it's too long use your phone to avoid eye contact when you're having a conversation with someone in person it's important to avoid looking them in the eyes there's a reason why wild animals will attack you if you hold eye contact with them it's because it's rude instead to be more polite take your phone out and look at it while you're talking to them it becomes a convenient tool to help you avoid breaking the biggest social taboo of looking someone in the eyes always message about messages because email falls outside the sphere of social media some people aren't super vigilant about it anymore so when you do send someone an email they don't reply within 15 minutes send them a text to let them know about the email you sent and if they don't respond to your text within 5 minutes send them a message on Facebook to let them know about the text you sent letting them know about the email you sent and if they don't worry you find your Facebook message within one minute send them another email this time accusing them of intentionally ignoring you and then send them a text to let them know about the second email you just sent people love receiving your messages letting them know about other messages you've said as you can see phone etiquette in 2018 is pretty straightforward that's all you need to know to be a respectable member of society

(Cinematica),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcVtsnFeLC8,0,1559335,16912,818,2457,kcVtsnFeLC8,hi everyone we have a very special 107 facts video for you today this was made by our friend david levin who happens to be the biggest back to the future fan we have ever met so without further ado take it away david levin well here we are in 2015 doc brown and marty mcfly should be showing up any day now to do something about marty's kids so while we're waiting i'm david and here are 107 facts you should know about back to the future oh and if you're the one person in this time continuum who has never seen the movie go watch it and then come back of course there are spoilers ahead go strap in when this episode hits number 88 number one back to the future was directed by robert zemeckis and written by him and bob gale number two they met at usc film school in 1971 then went on to write cheesy 70s shows like cold check the nightstalker and get christy love number three they later wrote the steven spielberg comedy flop 1941. number four 23 year old michael j fox was everyone's first choice to play marty mcfly at the time he was the popular star of the hit sitcom family ties unfortunately the producer of that show gary david goldberg told steven spielberg no way they couldn't have fox while the tv show was in production number five so producers continued their search for marty also considered for the role johnny depp corey hart c thomas howell ralph macchio john cusack and believe it or not charlie sheen number six finally they settled on eric stultz the hunky star of mask and some kind of wonderful to play marty and settled was the operative word producers still wanted fox but universal executive sid scheinberg was so sure stultz was the right guy he told producers that if stultz didn't work out they could replace him number seven from the beginning staltz was a little bit of a problem stoltz was a method actor and while on set he insisted that everyone call him marty he wouldn't even answer to his own name number eight after six weeks of shooting both steven spielberg and bob zemeckis said enough's enough the talented actor didn't have the comic chops that zemeckis was looking for number 9 stoltz didn't take it well one online account said spielberg approached him saying eric i need to talk to you stoltz replied i'm marty no said spielberg you're eric and you're fired it's too bad that account is false i kind of like it they actually did try to be nice about it but stultz threw a fit anyway number 10 however it happened it reportedly cost 3 million dollars to reshoot all of stiltz's scenes with michael j fox number 11 but stoltz may have actually made it into the finished movie twice once when marty jumps into the delorean in the yellow radiation suit and second when marty punches biff in the face according to tom wilson who played biff that was eric stultz's fist he said they never filmed that particular angle with michael j fox number 12 gary david goldberg reluctantly agreed to let fox do the film on the condition that he not miss any work on family ties so fox pulled double duty while shooting the film family ties during the day from nine till six back to the future from six till two am he slept in the back of the van on the way home and started all over again the next day this sucked for the back to the future crew who shot everything except fox's scenes until he arrived on set as for fox he said i'm 22. what do i need sleep for number 13 zemeckis knew he had his marty when on fox's first night of shooting he nailed this line are you telling me you built a time machine out of a delorean number 14 here's another bit of recasting you might not have known about okay most people know that claudia wells who played jennifer and back to the future part one was replaced by elizabeth chu for part two and three claudia was unavailable she had to take care of her mom who had cancer but what you may not have known was that claudia almost didn't get the part after she already had it wait a minute follow us for a minute it gets a little tricky originally claudia was cast as jennifer for the first film but when the movie started shooting with eric stoltz she was unavailable because she had gotten cast in a sitcom so another actress melora harden who eventually went on to do the office was cast to play jen but when michael j fox entered the picture harden was too tall for him so claudia wells now available again since that sitcom got cancelled was brought back to play jennifer all clear no well it's not that important number 15 claudia did get to reprise her role as jennifer decades later this time in the video game of back to the future number 16 tim robbins was one of the people up for the part of biff number 17. christopher lloyd originally didn't want to do the film until he was talked into it by a friend number 18. now try to imagine doc brown played by jeff goldblum or john lithgow or james woods all were considered for the part number 19 christopher lloyd says he modeled doc brown after a combination of albert einstein and leopold stakowski number 20 besides the back in the future sequels christopher lloyd has reprised his doc brown role numerous times for the huey lewis power of love music video for the universal theme park ride a nike ad several foreign electronics commercials a simpsons theme park ride the back to the future cartoon show the very popular video game and in seth mcfarland's comedy a million ways to die in the west number 21 but lloyd did not do the voice of doc brown for the cartoon though only the live action sequences the cartoon voice was done by dan castellaneta who's also the voice of homer simpson number 22 later of course lloyd worked with zemeckis again in who framed roger rabbit number 23. zemeckis worked with many members of his back to the future team again including composer allen sylvestre who also did the scores for zemeckis's roger rabbit forrest gump castaway contact romancing the stone death becomes her what lies beneath the polar express and flight number 24 michael j fox and christopher lloyd reunited for an episode of fox's sitcom spin city number 25 musician huey lewis who wrote and performed the two hits from the film the power of love and back in time appears as the battle of the band's judge who calls marty's music too darn loud number 26 the power of love was huey lewis and the news's first number one hit staying at the top of the charts for 2 weeks in the summer of 85 you couldn't go anywhere without hearing the song number 27 michael j fox practiced the guitar for his big rockstar scene with an audio tape of johnny b goode playing at half speed number 28 johnny b good almost didn't make it into the film since the performance stopped the story dead in its tracks number 29 though originally chuck berry didn't want his song in the film he changed his mind when he was paid around fifty thousand dollars number thirty michael j fox's singing in the film was actually done by mark campbell who was credited as marty mcfly fox lip sync number 31. crispin glover also lip-synched much of his part he was so nervous during filming that he lost his voice and had to re-record his lines in the studio michael j fox and christopher lloyd also had to do a bit of re-recording the aircraft engines needed to generate winds for the dramatic storm sequence were also just too darn loud no one could hear them scream number 33 by the way doc brown might have been screaming because he really is up high on the tower hung from a harness and christopher lloyd was afraid of heights today that shot would have been done with green screen number 34 it's gigawatts not gigawatts when writers gail and zemeckis did their research the scientists they spoke to mispronounced the word and thus so did doc brown number 35 marty asks for a pepsi free though no longer made at the time it was one of the first caffeine-free colas number 36 he also asks for a tab a diet cola which has since been replaced by diet coke number 37 actor billy zane of titanic makes his screen debut in the movie as match he has no lines number 38 the girl who says who is that is sachi parker the real-life daughter of shirley maclaine number 39 burger king at the beginning of the film is not a product placement number 40 california raisins at the end of the film is though they got their money back since the sign was nearly unreadable number 41 mr fusion originally was supposed to have a westinghouse logo but the company nixed it number 42 instead of calvin klein in the french translation marty is called pierre kardan number 43. in the spanish translation he's levi strauss number 44. twin pines mall is actually puente hills mall in city of industry california number 45. marty is reportedly named after a production assistant zemeckis and gale had on their movie used cars number 46 1955 was the year of the big davy crockett craze the show was a huge hit on tv number 47 this clock foreshadows the big scene with doc brown later in the film it's a model of silent star harold lloyd no relation we presume in the classic comedy safety last number 48 michael j fox did a public service announcement in australia telling kids riding behind cars on skateboards is dangerous so is going 88 miles per hour in a parking lot kids don't try it at home number 49 a few of the shots of einstein in the car were really a stuntman and a dog posture number 50. doc brown's middle name is lathrop if you say emmett lathrop backwards it sort of sounds like time portal number 51 if you think about it too hard the marty we see jump into the delorean at the end of the film is probably not the same version of marty we see throughout the movie it's a version of marty that grew up in a fairly prosperous household with well-adjusted parents the loop that gets set up there is enough to melt your brain how is that marty going to muck up the past best not to dwell number 52 the 1955 clock tower chime is the same one that was used in the 1960 movie the time machine based on the h.g wells novel number 53 marty's middle name is sheamus number 54. the tv version of back to the future to jerks what happens to us in the future what do we become jerks or something number 55 the door of the delorean accidentally kept hitting michael in the head during production number 56 the bum on the bench in 1985 was the guy running for mayor in 1955 number 57 the classic honeymooners episode marty watches actually first aired december 31st 1955 nearly two months after this scene supposedly takes place number 58 tom biff wilson gets asked so many questions about back to the future that he now hands out postcards with faqs number 59 the song mr sandman was a number one hit in 1954 when it was recorded by the cordettes in back to the future the version that's playing is by the four races which only hit number five though in the uk it did hit number one number 60 princess diana attended the british premiere in 1985. number 61 lorraine's younger brother in 1955 was played by jason hervey who later played the older brother on a show that took place in the 1970s the wonder years number 62 to prepare for her role each day leah thompson would immerse herself in her dressing room with magazines from the mid-1950s while playing music from the period number 63 the novelization of the movie written from an early draft screenplay contains many scenes that were changed or never made it into the final film number 64. michael j fox and crispin glover had actually worked together before on an episode of family ties number 65 biff's last name tannen is based on a real-life studio executive ned tannen number 66 though it's a comic book that never existed in real life tales from space number eight actually turns up in an episode of third rock from the sun number 67 it does have an ec logo in the 1950s ec comics was a real comic company which published tales from the crypt which later became an hbo series that robert zemeck has produced see how it all goes around number 68 at one point universal executive sid scheinberg wanted the title of the movie changed to space man from pluto steven spielberg helped the producers head off that potential disaster by sending off a note to scheinberg thanking him for the laughs everyone got at his very clever joke number 69 scheinberg did get a few changes through though einstein doc brown's dog was originally going to be a chimp named shemp number 70 and scheinberg asked producers to name marty's mother after scheinberg's wife lorraine gary gary had acted in two of spielberg's other films jaws and 1941 number 71 lorraine's original name was going to be eileen and at one point meg number 72 scheinberg also suggested that they change professor brown to doc brown number 73 scheinberg was also responsible for changing the film's release date originally planned for a late august 85 release when scheinberg saw the overwhelming reaction to the previews he pushed the release up to july third meaning producers had less than nine weeks to finish the film after shooting was done number 74 because of that director robert zemeckis was reportedly a little unhappy with some of the effects including this shot of marty's hand disappearing number 75 when back to the future was pitched raunchy teen comedies were all the rage like risky business and porkys recent time travel movies like somewhere in time and time bandits were box office poison so the film was turned down by every major studio sometimes more than once sometimes for not being dirty enough number 76 executives at disney went the other way and squawked that the mother-son relationship was too risque number 77 eventually the success of robert zemeckis's film romancing the stone as well as a nudge by producer steven spielberg got the second look the film needed and universal gave the green light number 78 back to the future was not the first time robert zemeckis and bob gal wrote the line get your goddamn hands off her it was also uttered by mark mcclure in their film i want to hold your hand god damn hands off mcclure later appears in back to the future as morty's brother dave mcfly number 79 another i want to hold your hand alumni wendy joe sperber plays marty's sister linda number 80 hill valley high school was actually shot at whittier high school in whittier california which was the real life alma mater of the man who was vice president in 1955 richard nixon number 81 it took three hours in makeup to transform the beautiful 24 year old leah thompson into the frumpy 47 year old lorraine mcfly number 82 the numbers on doc brown's amplifier crm 114 is an homage to stanley kubrick who for some reason used that number in both dr strangelove and 2001 a space odyssey it also turns up in a clockwork orange number 83 you can still see the set for hill valley on the universal studios tour although the set has caught fire multiple times including one that burned down the courthouse in 1996 after it was struck by lightning number 84 shooting on the universal backlot allowed producers a lot of freedom first they set up and shot 1955 then they trashed the place to do the 1985 segments number 85 that backlot set has been used in numerous films and tv shows bet you've seen them including bye bye birdie the music man the incredible hulk buffy the vampire slayer bruce almighty the ghost whisperer gremlins to kill a mockingbird and the very first episode of the twilight zone number 86 the rock group van halen would not give producers the right to use the name of the band and the darth vader from vulcan sequence instead the walkman plays a piece of music eddie van halen composed especially for the film although he now calls it just a bunch of noise and it's his name not the bands on the audio cassette number 87 biff's signature lines make like a tree and get out of here what are you looking at butthead we're improvised by actor tom wilson and at last number 88 88 miles per hour has no special significance it was just a random number that producers thought was easy to remember number 89 an avid back to the future fan once tested a car in the parking lot of the life lone pines mall but was unable to rev it up to the 88 miles per hour in the amount of room available in the parking lot number 90. by the way actual deloreans only had a speedometer that went up to 85 the speedometer in the film had to be modified to go up to 95. number 91 five deloreans were used in the making of the movie plus a special one constructed to be taken apart to film interiors number 92 only 9 200 deloreans were ever made in the first place between 1981 and 1983. number 93 the retail price of a delorean in 1981 was 25 000 that's about sixty eight thousand dollars today number ninety four someone at universal's product placement department told them if they changed the car into a mustang ford would pay seventy five thousand dollars for the placement the producers blocked saying doc brown would never drive a mustang number 95 after he saw the movie john delorean sent a thank you note to the producers for presenting the delorean car as the vehicle of the future number 96 in the original script the time machine was going to be a refrigerator powered by a nuclear explosion steven spielberg nixed this idea concerned that kids would start playing in old refrigerators it didn't seem to bother him too much when he later used the same idea in the fourth indiana jones movie maybe he knew no one would want to see that movie number 97 who's president of the united states in 1985 ronald reagan ronald reagan the actor president ronald reagan loved back to the future producers asked for white house permission to use the line about reagan in the film and he enjoyed the film so much that not only did he request a copy of the film for the white house but he also incorporated a line from the film in his state of the union address as they said in the film back to the future where we're going we don't need roads number 98 the skateboarding sequences in the film were choreographed by a european skateboard champion per welander god i hope i pronounced that right not tony hawk as some websites have reported number 99 producers have said that there will never be a back to the future sequel remake or reboot but they are working in london right now on a back to the future broadway musical number 100 when marty goes back to 1955 leaving from twin pines mall he runs over a baby pine tree when he returns to 1985 the mall is now called lone pine mall i noticed this the second time i saw the movie number 101 in 1955 marty is confronted by the farmer who owns the pine tree old man peabody and his son sherman these characters are named after the time traveling cartoon characters peabody and sherman why did it take me 30 years to figure this one out 102. the film was inspired by bob gale's father's high school yearbook when gail wondered if he and his dad would have been friends if they had actually met in high school number 103 marty goes back to november 5th which is the birthday of writer bob gale's father not that you care but in a weird coincidence the date of the enchantment under the sea dance november 12 1955 is the actual day my parents got married number 104 also on november 12 1955 chuck berry was named billboard's most promising r b artist number 105 the film was the top box office hit in 1985 beating rambo cocoon breakfast club and rocky iv number 106 ultimately the three films in the franchise have made over a billion dollars which in 1955 dollars would come out to about 113 million seven hundred seven thousand nine hundred eighty seven dollars and sixty six cents and finally one hundred and seven back to the future was not originally intended to have any sequel we've gotta back up we don't have enough roads to get up to 88 roads well we're going we don't need roads that's right even though the film eventually spawned two sequels it was supposed to be a one-off but the film proved to be so popular that when it was released on home video producers added the graphic to be continued at the end of the movie that's not something you'd see in the theatrical release or on the dvd release and who knows maybe we'll do 107 facts you need to know about back to the future two and three see you then

miles away it looked like swim one would do the rescue as they were already at the splashdown site however the huge waves turned the Columbia capsule upside down it took several minutes for the airbags to upright the module this gave swim to the designated rescue team time to reach the capsule wolfram was the first man in the water his job was to attach the sea anchor to stabilize the

name is Nick Hodges and we're back again with another mobster classic this time we'll be taking a look at casino following the groundbreaking success of Goodfellas Martin Scorsese returned to the gangster genre that we all know and love and as before it is also based on real events that took place during the 1970s and 80s it was a time when the Mafia ruled the city of Las Vegas no other criminal organization and American history had ever risen to such power but not even this was enough for them to survive the changing times greed and recklessness would play key roles in their downfall especially by the actions of the real-life mobster played by Joe Pesci and oh speaking of which just because Joe Pesci's in this movie don't expect me to be making too many jokes in this video like I did with his music career my Goodfellas review there's just so much history to cover here that I feel needs to be prioritized and it's not because I'm worried my jokes have offended anyone well maybe Joe Pesci but I doubt he'll accept my apology anytime soon look I know I'm the last person you want to speak to you right now bye I sincerely am sorry for what I said about your music it was pretty childish for me to say the least so are we how we cool yes anyway it is in this epic drama the director Martin Scorsese explores the reign of a criminal empire and what led to its demise but how much of the story is true what separates between fact and Hollywood fiction well my fellow history buffs let's find out this is Casino if you look into the history of Las Vegas you'll find it colorful to say the least you could almost say that was a city built from crime even during the days of the Wild West was known as one of the most dangerous settlements in America isolated in the middle of the desert and as lack of law enforcement made it a breeding ground for criminals it had all sorts from cattle rustlers to thieves to bandits all of them look to Las Vegas to seek their fortune the same would be true decades later during the 1950's since gambling was legal in Las Vegas the map has spent millions of dollars building lavish hotels at casinos they threw these amazing musical shows that were headlined by such icons like Frank Sinatra Dean Martin and Elvis Presley and that in turn attracted the Hollywood elite to come down as well which brought in a sense of even more glamour and excitement to the city they even had these crazy wild parties where guests could watch atomic bombs being tested in the desert 50 miles away right from the comfort of their hotels this all helped transform Las Vegas into a thriving tourist industry bringing in 8 million visitors a year and 200 million dollars in legal casino profits but as impressive that this all was the Mafia never intended to go completely legitimate they wanted to use the casinos to launder their illegal money and later came up with a rackets called the skim the way it worked was that they would pockets untaxed casino money by falsifying records through rigged slot machines and weighing scales they were even able to infiltrate the completely out of bounds count rooms and take money right out of the cash boxes now notice how an account where nobody ever seems to see anything somehow somebody's always looking the other way now look at these guys they look busy right they're counting money who wants to bother business as usual oh hello the bike and that's all there is to it casino with a suitcase the Mafia found it so easy stealing money this way that they were able to do it every month which they then distributed amongst the families for whatever their invested ownership was of the casinos who was one of the easiest and most lucrative rackets they ever made now since that pretty much covers how the Mafia came to Las Vegas let's go ahead and look into the film itself the first thing I'd like to do is point out that casino is an entirely different animal - Goodfellas although they are both historical movies Goodfellas is technically the most accurate of the two and that's down to a creative decision made by Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi while Goodfellas openly states that is based on a true story Casino is only adapted from a true story so shouldn't be held to the same standard of accuracy it should really be regarded as historical fiction since none of its characters are named after the real people and some of the events have been either changed or altered entirely that being said the movie is still pretty accurate once you figure out who is who and what is what then everything becomes clear for example let's take a look at casinos leading protagonists ace Rothstein a mob associate who manages their biggest casino the Tangiers his reputation as a highly skilled gambler makes him the perfect man for the job now this character is based on a real person except it wasn't a suave scene but Frank lefty Rosenthal and he didn't manage one casino but for the Hacienda the Fremont the marina and the crown jewel the Stardust the main inspiration behind the Tangiers and just like his film counterparts lefty Rosenthal dedicated his life to gambling particularly in sports betting born in 1929 lefty spent his teenage years reading dozens of copies of newspapers sports magazines and racing forms he followed the progress of jockeys athletes sports teams and catalog past performances and playing patents whether it be in horse racing boxing or football lefty would find the inside scoop crunches numbers until he could accurately predict the odds when we were first hanging out together he'd know if the quarterback was on coke get the wind velocity so he could judge the field goals even figured out the different bounce you got off the different kinds of wood they use my college basketball court you know although lefty religiously followed the world of sports he was never a true fan of it it was just a way to make money now in the movie they never outright say where the character ace Rothstein is from or anyone else for that matter all they ever say is back home back home I'm not exactly sure why they do this but almost everybody came from Chicago including Lefty and it was in Chicago during the 1950's where he would meet his future employers starting out as a Clark and then later as a bookie he and his colleagues were allowed to operate by paying protection to crooked cops these cops in turn would kick a percentage of the tribute to the Chicago mafia also known as the outfit when they spotted left his talent they offered him a bigger role and their profit skyrocketed earning lefty a great deal of respect and eventually was put in charge of the entire legal bookmaking rackets this decision while lucrative for the mob wouldn't go unnoticed for very long throughout the 1960s lefty would have freaking run-ins with the law over charges of bribery and match-fixing although never formally convicted the authorities did make things easy for him such as getting him bans from the horse and dog tracks in Florida this kind of heat definitely hindered his ability to earn but fortunately for Lefty a golden opportunity came as way the Alpha decided that the best solution for Lefty was a fresh start in Las Vegas and offered him the job of running their casinos Gaming Commission would never I have a license to work in a casino all you gotta do is apply for one the state law says that you can work in a casino while they're processing your application they got a ten-year backlog but what happens when they do fine they'll never find out all you gotta do is keep changing your job title like beverage and so in 1968 Frank Rosenthal came out to Las Vegas but UTA's criminal record he couldn't be officially recognized on paper as the casinos owner that job title had to go to a squeaky-clean frontman in the movie his name is Philip Green but the real guy was Alan Glick a real estate mogul like his character however he was for San Diego and not Arizona but a big thing left out in casino was his rivalry with lefty Alan Glick naively believed that since he was the official owner Rosenthal had to answer to him he was only a casino manager after all but Glick quickly realized that wasn't to be the case any decisions about running the casino was made by lefty whilst Glick was either kept out of the loop or ignored entirely not even the staff recognized clicks Authority it was clear to everyone that Frank Rosenthal was the real man in charge from his very first day lefty micromanaged every little thing that went on in his casinos like disciplining the dealers with how they placed their chips criticizing the showgirls over their weights and yes even obsessing about the quantity of blueberries sold in his muffins how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has you're just falling apart I'd not are you talking about it's like everything else is you know this never gets done this might seem a bit eccentric but it's absolutely true lefty made sure that every blueberry muffin had at least ten blueberries in them as you could see Rosenthal was extremely strict and was probably seen as a bit of a dick by a staff but he can't deny that he was damn good at his job he even had the foresight to introduce a sports betting parlor inside a casino something that no other casino thought of doing before he came along but as much as lefty prided himself by doing things by the book he wasn't above using violence another scene in the movie that turn out to be true is when the security catch a card cheat and bring him into a storage room and just like what we see ace Rothstein do here Rosenthal let that shooter go with a warning by breaking his hand with a hammer under lefty strict oversight casino profits more than doubled earning the outfit millions of dollars to protect their investment and the profitable skimming scam the bosses decided in 1971 to send one of their top it forces to Las Vegas and make sure everything ran smoothly in the film this enforcer is Nicky Santoro but his real name was Tony Spilotro now an interesting thing I'd like to mention was the brilliant decision to cast your Pesci for this role you might think it was a no-brainer given this incredible performance in Goodfellas but it should be noted that Joe Pesci didn't look anything like the real Tommy DeSimone who was six for two whilst he was only five foot four but what's cool in casino is the cast who worked out to be much more authentic since Tony Spilotro was short as well the five foot two mobster was nicknamed the ant and like a scene as Nicky Santoro Tony Spilotro also had a bit of a Napoleon complex and compensated for it by using excessive violence known as one of the most feared gangsters in Chicago Tony had dreams of becoming boss of his own family someday an opportunity to prove himself came on the 15th of May 1962 when two mob-connected men were found dead in the car it was the Scavo brothers and the murders raised quite a stir in Chicago as they had been on sank the rules of the Mafia was that she could not kill anyone under their protection but that first been given the okay otherwise you would be killed and the guys responsible were Billy McCarthy and Jimmy miraculous Tony Spilotro was given the task of finding them and killing them and the way he went about it inspired the most graphic scene and Casino you know the one that really sticks in your head it's that bit in the movie where an Irish crew shoots up a bar and kills two mobsters and a waitress which isn't true what happened to Billy McCarthy when Tony found him is stuck ice picks in his boss you better gonna give him yours Frank yes why do you never talk in a last-ditch effort to make Billy talk Tony stuck his head in a vise and it was only when it cranked it up popped out his eyeball did Billy finally give up his accomplice Jimmy by killing Billy and Jimmy Tony Spilotro is promoted into a made man he continued rising through the ranks in Chicago until 1971 when he was rewarded a job in Las Vegas the reason why was that the Alfred had learned that some of their counters were stealing money from the skim the bosses were naturally furious about this and felt the splotches presence alone would be enough to deter any more would-be thieves he was also expected to protect Frank Rosenthal an old friend of his from back in the day for the same reasons that I am and it'd make a lot of money for us once pilâtre was in las vegas that's exactly what he did he got everyone in line stopped the leaks and protected lefty this is pretty much all he was expected to do but Tony soon grew Restless with his assignment and wanted to take things to the next level now although the Mafia had a stake in running the casinos none of them were involved in any street-level crime this is because they wanted to make Las Vegas safe for tourists which made it untouched by organized crime Tony Spilotro got started by running a loan sharking racket extorting bookies and dealers alike he also intimidated the local criminals into paying him a street tax with Spilotro muscling in the city experienced a huge crime wave now you might be wondering why this didn't alarm the Mafia well it's simply due to greed spell atre was a good owner and as long as he kept them happy with money they were willing to look the other way and that's how lefty and spilatro the two biggest players in Las Vegas made their fortune for the next few years but it couldn't last forever it was 1975 when things first started going wrong for the mob in Vegas it turned out that the squeaky-clean frontman Allen Glick had a few secrets of his own a silent partner by the name of tomorrow rant had loaned clique half a million dollars a few years before and believed she was entitled to a 5% share the casinos when Glick refused to negotiate tomorrow rant filed a lawsuit against him one that would require opening Allen glicks books in court by pursuing legal action Tamara had unknowingly sealed her fate this was because opening the books threatened to expose the outfit leaving the with little choice but a sanction a hit and it happened almost exactly like we see in casino on November 9th 1975 a gunman broke into Tamara's home grabbed her by the jaw and shot her five times in the head the only difference is as unlikely that spilatro pulled the trigger himself in any case tomorrow rands murder made headline news and cost a lot of suspicion on Allen Glick harassed by hordes of journalists he denies having anything to do with her death or being affiliated with organized crime it didn't help though the suspicion alone was enough to convince authorities to take a closer look with a little digging they found out how Rosenthal had been secretly running the casinos without a gaming license and if he wanted to continue he'd have to apply for one before the Nevada Gaming Control Board which was an awkward position for lefty due to his criminal record nevertheless Rosenthal prepared his case as best he could and hoped his contributions to Las Vegas would see him through the hearing took place in January 1976 and left he felt fairly optimistic about his chances but before he was even given a chance to speak the board voted unanimously to reject his license barring him from working in any casino Rosenthal was completely outraged and vowed to fight the Gaming Control Board in court it wasn't until the following year in early 1977 to Rosenthal win his case with the Nevada Supreme Court overruling the Gaming Control board's decision and lifting the casino ban he could once again work in a casino but not in anything tied to gaming now although this was a big win for left he continues making a public spectacle in court in his fight for a gaming license something that the Mafia were adamantly against so they told Alan Glick to rehire Rosenthal as the food and beverage chairman so he could secretly go back to running the casinos but because left he wanted the clears public image he later chose another job in April 1977 he became the Stardust Entertainment director and hosted a late-night talk show called the Frank Rosenthal show where he interviewed celebrities like Frank Sinatra Don Rickles and even OJ Simpson he also showed musical acts and held discussions about the disco scene it wasn't very good to be honest but that didn't matter to Lefty he really just wanted to use his show as a platform to attack the Nevada Gaming Commission let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously I recently challenged him to a debate on this program and he declined what are you worried about Pat you don't have to send me any questions you can ask me anything you want by parading himself on TV lefty was seriously testing the outfits patience instead of laying low he was bringing in all sorts of unwanted attention a problem that the bosses were already trying to deal with elsewhere while Rosenthal was fighting his legal battles in 1976 Tony Spilotro had been busy making moves of his own he opened a jewelry shop called the gold rush and used it as a base for a burglary crew he had recruited from Chicago from wealthy homes hotel rooms to jewelry stores they hit every target they possibly could the crew had figured out that many alarms were only tripped when a door was breached so what they did instead was to break you through the walls and ceilings this simple tactic earned them the nickname the hole in the wall gang and the media covered their every exploits Las Vegas had been relatively peaceful before splutter came along but had never seen anything quite like this the public quickly grew angry with how little was being done to stop these break-ins and this was due to investigations being hindered by corrupt cops and politicians who believe that the mobs casinos were too important to risk for Las Vegas economy especially over just a few burglaries seeing the corruption what it was it was down to the FBI to solve this mess by 1977 they placed Tony Spilotro and all his associates under constant surveillance which wasn't easy since pilâtre knew he was being watched thanks to a tip-off from the Metro Police picker bull you'll watch you and just like we see in casino Tony took precautions like buying anti surveillance equipment switching cars to throw off tails speaking in code of his taps phones and covering his mouth so his lips can be read the only thing you didn't do which we see in the movie was personally take part in these burglaries eventually splutter became so good eluding the FBI that they were willing to commit enormous resources on him I mean for example let's take a look at the scene when Niki santora's playing golf now you think that this bit might be too ridiculous to be true but surprisingly no on October 12th 1981 the FBI were flying a surveillance plane over the Las Vegas Country Club when it was abruptly forced to make an emergency landing much to the amusement of everyone watching the feds were watching Niki played golf for so long they ran out of gas okay that part isn't exactly true the plane didn't run out of fuel it just had mechanical problems but it doesn't really matter this was still a huge embarrassment to the FBI especially when they made the news I was playing tennis and I saw a plane just come down didn't hear any sounds cuz the engine must have been dead but despite his best efforts Spilotro couldn't throw off the feds forever by that point they already had a good idea of what the mob was doing in Vegas this was thanks to the Kansas City wiretap back in November 1978 which recorded some mobsters talking about the skin and what they discussed it's pretty close to what we see in casino the only big difference was that this happened in a pizzeria and not a grocery store by early 1979 spolanos ego was out of control thinking he was untouchable he began to grow reckless to the points whisper lotterer even stopped following mafia conduct a decision that ultimately led to his affair with Lefty's wife Jerry now sleeping with another man's wife in the Mafia is punishable by death something that's pilâtre didn't appreciate until much later this time I never started with this saw anyone else having an affair then you had to tell the boss a situation that's blotters best friend Frank Cullotta found himself in when rumors of the affair reach Chicago there's one thing about these old-timers they don't guys wives it's bad for business so I lied even though I knew that by lying the gahjii I could wind up getting killed too no I ain't seen anything like that this didn't really convince the bosses as they heard rumors of Spilotro flaunting his affair with Jerry out in public but without any confirmation then all they had was their suspicions that same yes pilâtre found out that an associate of is called Jerry Lisner had been arrested and wanted to cut a deal with the FBI so on October 10th 1979 Spilotro sent Frank Cullotta to kill him but what Frank didn't realize until after the murder was that Tony Spilotro had lied about getting the OK from Chicago which is another grave offense of the Mafia also punishable by death but spilatro didn't seem too concerned he probably felt that as long as he continued to be a good earner the outfit would always look the other way but just a few months later in December 1979 Tony Spilotro is blacklisted by the Nevada Gaming Commission and was banned from every casino in the state and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up only thing I can't believe is how many people you said are in the black book my they get to named an airport country throughout I honestly don't know why this is in the movie because it doesn't make any sense Al Capone could have been in the black book because he died in 1947 and the book didn't exist until 1960 and it didn't just have two people in it by 1979 for something closer to 14 anyway by not being allowed in the casino men that Spilotro couldn't oversee the skim the very job he was assigned to do so you could probably guess just how fed up the Chicago Outfit was with them but worse was still yet to come by early 1981 the FBI made a major breakthrough their case by flipping a member from the hole-in-the-wall gang the alarms expert Sal Romano who spent several months secretly recording their meetings the crew were getting ready for their biggest score yet to rob a jewelry store called Bertha's gifts and home furnishings with a potential 1 million dollar payout the plan was to break into the store roof on the 4th of July 1981 so the Independence Day fireworks could muffle their drilling under the cover of darkness the crew crept onto the roof and began their work only to be surrounded moments later by dozens of cops and FBI agents almost the entire crew was arrested and charged with multiple counts of burglary including spolanos right-hand man and best friend Frank Cullotta whose characters renamed Frank Marino and Casino now we don't see any of this in the movie but this was a crucial moment to tony spilotro's downfall while Frank Cullotta was in jail the FBI repeatedly offered to reduce his sentence if he became a government witness but since Frank was loyal he refused to rat that was until a few months later when a federal agent played for him one of their wiretaps and on the tape was a recorded phone call between Tony Spilotro and the Chicago Outfit receiving the green light to kill Frank this was devastating to Frank as he had kept his honor but faced with certain death Frank decided to accept the deal and was placed into witness protection in early 1982 things escalated even further that year on October 4th lefty Rosenthal was leaving a restaurant and got into his car but when he turned the key in the ignition the car suddenly burst into flames the bomb had been made for him but it failed to go off properly leaving a badly burns lefty to escape with his life it still isn't known who was responsible but there may have been Tony Spilotro trying to cover up his affair with Jerry it could also have been a sanction hit by the Mafia for all of lefties legal problems in any case the failed car bombing had sent a clear message and convinced lefty to leave Las Vegas for good in 1983 the knocked over 24th 1983 spinatra was indicted and stood trial in Chicago for the murders of billy mccarthy and timmy miraculous back in 1962 however he was acquitted because the judge Thomas J Maloney decided that Frank Cullotta testimony wasn't quite good enough now if you're thinking that's a bit shady and he should probably know that same judge was later convicted for bribery in 1992 anyway all those pilâtre got away this time he wasn't done yet within a month he was hit by three different indictments based on further evidence by Frank Cullotta they ranged from armed robbery the murder of Jerry Lisner and his involvement with the skin the FBI had also collected enough evidence to indict 15 mob bosses from Chicago Milwaukee Cleveland and Kansas City to top it all off the Nevada Gaming Commission then shut down all of their casinos costing the outfit a fortune in lost revenue the next few years were spent with everyone going in and out of court and by 1986 five of the bosses were sent to prison that was the last straw as fast Tony Spilotro was concerned and a decision was made to kill him now the way it happens in the movie is kind of close to the truth but not exactly we see Niki and his brother Dominic meets up with a bunch of mobsters in a cornfield when they suddenly start getting beaten with baseball bats and his Nicki Centaurus best friend Frank Marino who lands the first blow now as I mentioned before Frank marinas character is heavily based on Frank Cullotta who obviously couldn't have killed Tony and his real brother Michael since he was in witness protection the two brothers were also not killed with baseball bats or buried alive in my opinion it was much more brutal than that I actually think that the reason the used baseball bats is because it's kind of a tongue-in-cheek reference to Goodfellas I'm sure you can all remember that the act of Frank Vincent also play Billy batts and since he gets killed by Joe Pesci in that movie they figured that Frank Vincent should kill him in this movie with a baseball bat no less anyway so what really happened was on the 14th of June 1986 Tony was invited to Chicago to see his brother Michael become a made man the ceremony was to take place in the basement of an isolated house but once Tony and Michael were downstairs they realized that everyone else in the room was wearing gloves the two brothers were then violently punched and kicked to death from all directions this execution was as personal as it could get everyone wanted a piece of Tony for all the damage he caused by the time they were finished the two brothers were unrecognizable from their wounds the bodies were then driven out to a cornfield and buried in an unmarked grave before being discovered by a farmer just over a week later on the 23rd of June 1986 so the last thing I want to talk about in this review is the betrayal Frank lefty Rosenthal for the most part casino does a pretty good job of representing the real man through his clothing his mannerisms his obsession to detail and acknowledging that the man was an egotistical prick but because he's the main protagonist the movie does take a few liberties in making him more sympathetic not a lot but just enough for the audience to get the wrong impression of him the most obvious way they do this is through his on-screen relationship with his wife Jerry who has renamed ginger in the movie now I think we can all agree that this is a marriage made in hell and his biggest reason seems to be ginger she's a character hated by many for being a manipulative volatile woman who only marries ace for his money and obsessing of a materialistic wealth are hardly romantic qualities that people look up to in a relationship we may have been banned from Twitter but the movies keep on Rome and this month we're better Aces High as we become moving matchmaker casino we dip reloj Bennifer in this romantic comedy ginger Gamble's for love a sweet-talking go-getter who knows what she wants and how to get it somebody get me some ginger coz this girl's given me butterflies Sam a man who's not afraid to wear pink and respects women as long as there's a mutual respect that kind of thing Nikki the party animal who still finds time to be a family man and Lester Sam may have put a ring on it but diamonds are a girl's best friend the season of giving continues and so can you by voting in your favorites endless smashing that like button anyway I'm not trying to say that the real woman was something of a saint just that some of the details in a story have been tweaked to make her on-screen character look much worse in the movie the real Jerry was Geraldine McGee from Los Angeles California she originally started out as an aspiring dancer and swimsuit model her agent and also her lover was a man called Lenny mom or and he's the basis for the character lester diamond but sound like in the movie lenny mom or wasn't a pimp and jerry wasn't his former prostitute nor was he any of the other things claims by ace Rothstein but one thing that just could never understand was that she could have everything under control except for her old pimp boyfriend Lester diamond he was a moocher a card sheik a country club golf hustler scumbag chasing dentists for a few bucks by making lester a pimp movie not only turns the audience against him but also changes his relationship with ginger we see ginger as a victim of Lester not his romantic partner but in real life Jerry and Leni were highschool sweethearts and they even had a daughter together a fact completely left town casino in 1960 Lenny convinced Jerry to move to Las Vegas to find work while si stayed behind in Los Angeles she spent the next several years working as a cocktail waitress a showgirl and as a socialite before finally meeting lefty Rosenthal in 1968 lefty completely fell in love with Jerry and he started a relationship together but when he proposed just a year later Jerry had to explain that she didn't share the same feelings as he did so what left he did instead was pidge's proposal like a job opportunity promising financial security for Jerry and her daughter and an assurance that she could keep her independence whether she loved him or not under those conditions jerry agreed and they got married in 1969 by 1973 the couple had a son together but already their marriage had begun falling apart left he expected jerry to commit to being a mother and a housewife but jerry resented Lefty's efforts to control her so she go out every night drinking and passing on the strip eventually it got so bad the lefty threatened a divorce and had take custody of their son and she cut back on her drinking and agreed to have a second child Jerry reluctantly accepted as she gave birth to a baby girl not that it solved anything now while we do see casino just how toxic their married life was it does make ginger look like she was most at fault through our drug and alcohol addiction and the time she's tied up her daughter to the bed what we don't see is ace Rothstein cheat on her or viciously beat her like the real left he did throwing ginger out of the house or threatening to kill her for tying up his daughter is about as physical as ace again you ever do anything like that simple all lace really does is force ginger to carry a beeper so you can know where she is at all times but he get the impression that ace reluctantly feels that he has to do to her self-destructive behavior whereas the real Lefty had always been controlling he micromanaged their marriage like he was one of his casinos he taped a daily schedule to the fridge and made a check-in with him every day and when he take this into consideration you can begin to kind of understand why Jerry acted the way she did like the time she tried to run off with her kids with Al anymore more or even her affair with Tony Spilotro she was basically looking for a way out so like I said before casino does take a few liberties but there are enough to make lefty Rosenthal look pretty good by the end of it but there's one thing I found out about this guy that not even the filmmakers were aware of there's a very strong case that Frank lefty Rosenthal was a rat I know this might be hard to believe it isn't mentioned in the film or in many books or documentaries and the reason why is because this didn't become public knowledge until after Lefty's death on October 30th 2008 when a journalist called Jane and Morrison published an article that very day she stated that left he was given the codename Achilles was described as a top echelon informant to the FBI and provided first-hand knowledge of the Chicago Outfit and their casino scheme operation now there's a couple of reasons why I think this might be true one is that Jane and Morrison has been following this story since the very beginning if you look at this pic for example you could see a interview in Tony Spilotro in 1933 and I was also intrigued when I found the Declassified FBI files they're released only as recently as 2017 and they do mention an informant called Achilles confirming or Jana and Morrison wrote an article back in 2008 there's also this great panel you should check out by the mob museum discussing the real history behind casino and they not only reveal that lefty was an informant but also that his wife Jerry was an FBI source I was told by Al they he had him lefty as an informant and that Jerry Rosenthal was a source they didn't know the other one was talking to the same agent now with lefty Rosenthal I can go so far as saying that I know I knew there was something something odd with him because I know on numerous occasions morning morning - and probably up to maybe the fire there's no I I was always test it was given the subpoena by my supervisor go serve it on lefty Rosenthal but I did service subpoena on a minute but I know the subpoenas never did anything not just to be clear this is not a hundred percent confirmed but the information I was able to find was enough to convince me that this is true because when you stop to think about it it does make sense lefty never made a bet in his life that first calculating the odds and seeing them stacked so high up against him years before anyone else did he somehow figured out a way to avoid prison without having to testify in open court and still keep all his money the only thing he didn't do was go back to working for the Mafia as we are told in casino well that about wraps it up my name is Nick Hodges and thanks for watching history buffs and remember if you like the show help the channel grow if you wish to support history buffs

experienced astronauts he'd been a backup pilot for the first moon landing in July of 69 upon all fair program Apollo 11 had transfixed the world but then came Apollo 12 and now 13 moon shots had come to seem routine so you weren't front-page news did that bother you at all no because this is what I wanted to do Apollo 13 would bring back rock and soil samples from a hilly region of the moon a much trickier landing site than those of previous missions lovell's fellow astronauts Jack Swigert and Fred Hayes were both on their first space flight if the thought of going to the moon was just so incredible that I couldn't pass up the chance as Hayes and the others tell it today none of them gave a moment's thought to the one thing about the mission that did catch the average person's attention a lot of people just don't even deal with the number 13 they don't want to talk about it did it register with you at all it didn't I didn't even think about the number being superstitious that is not true with my wife my wife Marilyn said why 13 it did bother me yes I said what happened to 14 but unlike an elevator NASA didn't skip 13 superstition can't have any place as if to drive home the point lead flight director Gene Kranz recalls that NASA's scheduled Apollo 13 launch for 1:13 p.m. or in military time 1313 you were kind of flaunting the fact that you didn't care about superstition I think every person that was in this room lived to flaunt the odds we were working on a ragged edge of all knowledge all technology and all experience in this room this room was Krantz domain Mission Control in Houston it had the smell of the cigarette smoke I mean we all smoked very heavily pipe cigars cigarettes coffee pot that had been boiled over and it burned out Krantz oversaw a 24-7 team of young engineers who controlled every aspect of Space Flight the astronauts lives in their hands you guys had to look around in each other and think we're kind of a group of badasses in here I mean you had to feel pretty good about yourself well the culture of this room was literally miraculous it seemed that whatever happened we were better as a total team than the sum of the parts the same of course could be said for the three men riding the rocket all of them former test pilots or who mortal danger was just part of the job when you became an astronaut did you feel special did you feel invincible at all I didn't feel invisible I mean the rewards involved overcame the risk that was about four families at home a different equation did you ever get used to the risk involved Maryland no put it out of your mind but I can't say that it was easy at times so the day before launch you're out at a beach house and get ready to see your husband for the last time before he heads into space and something strange happened with your wedding ring what happened well I was taking a shower and I it just slipped right off my hand and it went into the drain and I just was terrified because to me it was like an omen that something really was going to happen it shook you up well I did shake me off did you ever tell Jim about it before the flight oh no oh no you would never let that thought enter his mind before he's about to jump on that rocket no for some reason other of the astronaut Wives just never discussed anything that would worried their husbands before they went on a flight I mean we kept everything to ourselves several hours before launching you guys get in that elevator that takes you for the ride alongside of and then eventually to the top of the Saturn rocket that that's a law elevator ride up it's 337 feet just the crew three of us and a couple nervous checkout people are getting us into the spacecraft because it's basically a huge bomb that you're riding up alongside five and a half million pounds of high explosives in the form of oxygen hydrogen and everything else any jitters no it's too late for jitters in summer they say you know five four three right go at your underwear we have two men and we have liftoff at 2:13 well it lifts off most people think that would be a big kick in the pants starts off very slowly because the vehicle weighs so much we know it has a five engines running saturn v going up in 7.5 million pounds and truck and it had cleared the tower that's when you have your head close to the abort switch in case anything really goes wrong and something did go wrong one of the engines in the second stage of the rocket shut down prematurely forcing Mission Control to make a series of quick calculations are the remaining engines all go do we have enough propellant to get the crew up in orbit but within seconds mission controllers determined that despite the malfunction Apollo 13 was good to go for the moon weather to my companions that I said you know every flight has a crisis something always goes wrong this happened early in the flight and we're now free and clear of any other things going wrong and he was right for about 55 hours on April 11 1970 2 hours and 35 minutes after liftoff Apollo 13 fired its rock accelerated 24,000 miles an hour and left Earth's orbit found for the moon and people always say Jim they say into the calm and the peace of outer space outer space is a pretty hostile environment isn't it well it is you had to be prepared for it outside was a complete vacuum if the ship's hull failed the crew would die in seconds if the power failed they'd freeze to death in hours everything they needed to survive air water food and fuel had to be carefully managed even when things are going smoothly it's a high-stress environment is it oh definitely but you might think the whole program in those days is sort of a high-stress environment it certainly was on the ground in the pressure cooker that was Mission Control watching and listening to your crew die is something that will impress that event upon your mind forever Gene Kranz had been a flight director when just three years earlier Apollo one caught fire on the launch pad incinerating astronauts Gus Grissom ed white and Roger Chaffee soon after Kranz helped write a document called foundations of Mission Control I'm going to read you a passage from it it says quote suddenly and unexpectedly we may find ourselves in a role where our performance has ultimate consequences the work in this room is final the decisions are final the team in this room must be prepared not only to make those decisions but to live with the results that occur but the first two days of Apollo 13s missions hardly seemed like life or death spacecrafts in real good shape as far as we're concerned Jim we're bored to tears down here the spacecraft had three parts the cone-shaped command module was where all three men would ride for most of the trip to the moon and then back to earth the spidery lunar module or em would carry two astronauts to the lunar surface then he left behind the last critical piece was the service module which contained the main engine and oxygen tanks sir Caine - we got a groovy PV picture 55 hours and 11 minutes into the mission Apollo 13s crew made time for an important duty public relations they beamed back a live TV show to earn something NASA liked to do so taxpayers could see what they were up to Fred Hayes was the acura this whole thing one of the lunar module and he opened up the bed that he was going to sleep on sort of a hammock and he tried to show people how he was gonna sleep of us but of course he sealed gravity so he kept piling up enough antenna and Epico era a kick and a hammock a a light-hearted look at life in space North America great show except Noah was watching them explain why that was what Network had Dick Cavett a live show I think a second network had a rerun of Lucy and the third network at least of the city of Houston Texas the baseball game was going on and everybody was watching that including the people of the control center here we had been to the moon twice and in some ways ho-hum had said in complacency Jim's wife Marilyn and daughters Barbara and Susan did watch the show in a private viewing room at Mission Control and when you found out that not one of the network's carried that broadcast how did it make you feel pretty bad it did upset me yes but they got to see something the rest of the world didn't an example of Fred Hayes's unusual sense of humor you pulled something during that event that kind of got everyone's attention and Jim Lovell Commodore don't talk to me about it there is a valve and a limb to repress valve that when cycled does make a fairly pronounced bang haze turned the valve on live TV and the bang startled commander Jim Lovell he throws it and it gives a big bang you know and then inside the space where's the staff so we look and say oh that's haze again no harm done it was after the broadcast Jim that that mission control radios up and they and they asked you to do something as the crew that was fairly routine involving one of the liquid oxygen takes two tanks of supercooled liquid oxygen were the ship's most precious resource providing both air and fuel to get accurate readings from the tanks mission controllers had to make sure the liquid didn't settle at the bottom what they asked you to do it's sort of like a mush that's liquid oxygen and so there's a fan down to the bottom of inside the tank and a little heater system and so the question was would you turn on the fan of a heater system and stir up the oxygen and to accomplish that inside the spacecraft what did you have to do actually just flip a switch rarely flip the switch they were about two hundred thousand miles from Earth when Jack Swagger flipped the switch at the date I the way was April 13th to invited be returned for a beer Crowley her ready seconds later the men of Apollo 13 were fighting for their lives at precisely 55 hours 53 minutes and 18 seconds into the flight of Apollo 13 astronaut Jack Swigert followed mission controls instruction to flip the switch that stirred the liquid oxygen tanks everything seemed normal and then it just had a big bang at one time and so we all looked around what happened what's that I looked up a Fred Hayes to see if he knew what was going on remember Hayes liked to play tricks with a pressure valve immediately Jim Lovell looks over to see as Fred Hayes pulled another fast one on me I'm sure he saw it my eyes and he saw I wasn't smiling and I could tell from his expression yeah no idea so this wasn't one of his practical jokes with the pressure he had no idea Hayes was in the tunnel between the command module and the lunar module I heard a loud bang and metallic sounds because the way the vehicle contorted and actually twisted enough in the tunnel area that crinkle of metal I could hear that metal crinkling did your heart jump up into your throat I mean that's that's that's not a sound you want to hear 200,000 miles from home absolutely and I knew it right away was not not a normal circumstance Jack Swagger radioed Mission Control probably and beggin please 15 seconds later Lovell repeated the message sorry right about I listened to that radio transmission that is probably as famous as the flight itself those five words Houston we've had a problem and I listened to the calm in your voice were you as calm as you sound I kind of think so I mean I was faced with a problem and so if I did nothing but you know it bust off the walls for 10 minutes I'd be right back to where that problem was things were not so calm in Mission Control as soon as we received this call it seems our data just went wild it was screwy and for about 60 seconds it was literally chaos in this room in those 60 seconds it seemed that every controller at every console saw a problem with Apollo 13 a flight we've had a computer restart now the controller says main bus wonderful third one says antenna switch it did not seem possible for so many things to go wrong at the same time they thought it had to be a fault in their communications were there monitoring systems not the spacecraft itself we may have had an invitation from play I immediately thought okay it's a minor electrical problem we'll work this when the shifts over the astronauts knew it was much worse than that they thought they'd been hit by a meteor Fred Hague's called Mission Control 50 seconds into the crisis we had a pretty large bang aggravated with the cordon line now in the first few minutes there was absolute disbelief the controllers had never come face to face with a real problem that we didn't have any immediate answers for crucial minutes ticked by Jim Lovell stared at his instrument pattern one oxygen tank gage the quarter gauge red zero and the other one I could see the needle start to go down ever so slightly and that's when I drifted over and looked out the side window and I saw escaping at a high rate of speed the gaseous substance from the rare Hawaiian spacecraft the crisis was now in minute 14 I was looking out the half fill er that's coming out after the place Roger we copy of any Jim this isn't like getting a blow out of your tire on a highway you are 200,000 miles into outer space drifting further and further away from Earth what's your emotion at that moment well I'll tell you the very first thing that I thought of why didn't this happen up Apollo 12 or why didn't wait for Apollo 14 forgot cohort okay can you tell us anything about the vetting okay coming from coming out on with the one right now do the astronauts seem abnormally calm Krantz says there's a reason this is why we flew experimental test pilots in the spacecraft their demeanor was such when you listen to these reports and get the reporting this coming in they're just reporting a situation onboard the spacecraft but everyone who heard levels report instantly knew what it meant we had an explosion with an enormous amount of Corollary damage in fact they came to learn Apollo 13 had suffered a catastrophic failure there was faulty wiring inside liquid oxygen tank to Jack Swigert stirred the tank a spark started a fire fueled by pure oxygen the tank blew up taking out the ship's main supplies of air and power I realized the gas escaping and the needle of my second and last tank the clarity gauge was one of the same and surely we'd be completely out of oxygen completely out of oxygen speeding away from Earth at 2,000 miles per hour I think every controller at that time recognized we're not going to the moon but also it's going to be tough am tough to get the crew of Apollo 13 home the odds were very small at that time among ourselves that we're going to get out of this alive the night of April 13th Marilyn Lovell and her daughters returned home from Mission Control were just minutes earlier they'd watched Jim and his crew on TV from outer space friends dropped in astronaut Pete Conrad and his wife the phone rang it was another friend who worked for NASA and he said over Meryl I just want you to know that all these different countries have offered to help you know in the recovery and whatever I couldn't understand what he was talking about nice add Jerry I said have you been drinking she knows sooner hung up then another phone a direct line to NASA started ringing and immediately Pete came out and I can still see him standing across the room from me with eyes as large as saucers and he said they're only have to talk he filled her in they turned on the TV Apollo 13 what's the forgotten moon flood suddenly the biggest story on earth Apollo 13 its power source is badly damaged its mission to the moon ended its astronauts under a strain more severe than any others have yet endured the ship was crippled on leaking oxygen created a mission to the moon over the three astronauts one of them her husband were probably doomed I just couldn't believe what I was hearing and at that moment the house was just filling with people people didn't know what to say to me best friends they couldn't say anything and says Jim Lovell he and Mission Control were not sure what to say to each other either well for emotional point of view Matt first of all they didn't want to say to us you have a real problem here and we didn't want to say to them I think we got a real problem I mean we knew that but is that just the bravado of a test pilot and astronaut no it's I think it's the case hey we're beyond that now we have a we have a problem how do we get out of this problem what do we do we don't know yet just what the steps are to do that but Jeanne Krantz knew they all had to start making some decisions and asked I was a fighter pilot fighter Fox my time used the words looking into the eye of a tiger and this was the feeling I had when I recognized we were in survival mode and we had to kick in and get going as a team to help this crew out the first problem oxygen the command module was going to run out in a matter of minutes they had to figure out a way to save Lovell haze and swaggered fast the only option was one they played out in simulations but never expected to do now they start looking at the lunar module did you ever think you'd have to use that module as a lifeboat never thought I'd have to use that as a lifeboat the lunar module the spidery looking craft they planned to land on the moon and then leave behind it had its own supply of air water and matter e power the lunar module was so fragile you could punch a hole through the skin in it but we had live off of it because it had oxygen what the lunar module could not do was reenter the Earth's atmosphere it could not get them home so even though the command module was crippled they had to save whatever air and power it had left the only thing in the command module was a little battery and a little oxygen tank for the final plunge to the Earth's atmosphere Jack Swagger was a command module pilot I said Jack you power down this command module save which you can we're going into the lunar module power it up and - basically you're buying time you're stalling for time in that lunar module so you can get back to that command module for that precise moment you need it to get back into the Earth's atmosphere that's right the command module was the only thing that had a heat shield one hour now into the crisis it was a race power down the command module before its batteries ran out power up the lunar module before oxygen ran out they'd all trained for years but never for this I knew the command module had only so much life left and we we very quickly had to get to a point in the startup of the lunar module before the command module completely died the command modules computers contain critical data the crew had to transfer to the lems computers fast and they had to do it the old-fashioned way so when people look at their blackberry today or their iPhone they're holding something in their hand that has far more computing capabilities than the spacecraft you were flying in outer space with oh yes Jack Swigert called me all the numbers and I wrote them data that we had a conversion table for the lunar module and I did the arithmetic to get the new numbers and then I called Mission Control I said would you check by my arithmetic for me please to make sure I'm afraid to make a mistake here well I think of cost of your life that's right I'll use that all the assets I have and that included the control center they got into the lunar module with moments to spare but now another decision loomed how to get back to earth I had a very fundamental decision I had to make we could execute what we call a direct important come around the front side of the moon and be home on a day and a half it was the quickest way home but it would mean using the main engine the one nearest the explosion what if that engine failed or blew up as well if this maneuver isn't executed perfectly you're going to impact the moon if the spacecraft would actually go right into the surface of the moon yeah yeah Kranz didn't want to take the risk the other option I have to go completely around the moon take between four and five days to get back home the problem with that was obvious to the astronauts themselves when we starting with a lunar module I realized it was desired for two guys for two days and I counted the crew one two three guys for four days simple arithmetic that meant they could run out of air power and water long before reaching Earth in the end it was the flight directors decision and it was purely in a gut feeling that says go around the moon take your chances trust your team to find the answers in other words take the long way home and risk losing their crew in space then listen can go we're now looking towards an orphan admitted five and a half hours after an explosion crippled their spaceship the crew of Apollo 13 was riding in a lifeboat three men in a lunar module meant for two the LEM was designed to carry them just 60 miles from lunar orbit to the surface now they had to use the lems rocket in a way it's designers never intended to steer them around the moon and set their course for Earth a quarter million miles away did you ever have any doubts about whether you could accomplish it well naturally I think everybody does in a situation like this they had a tiny margin for error and no second chances it's not just dying Jimmy it's the kind of death it's and I've thought about this it's running out of oxygen and drifting in space perhaps forever how did you deal with those thoughts oh we didn't think about what the final results would be if we weren't successful what would finally get to us what about of all kinds electrical power get it onto an orbit that we could correct and be in a orbit around the earth for hundreds of years you left one out you could come in too steep into the Earth's atmosphere and burn up I would have rather done that we now feel a velocity of 30 215 feet per second did you allow yourselves to have those emotional discussions did anybody start talking about family and what if what if we don't make it back to ourselves we thought about family not to each other he didn't bring that up we know we did not bring that up and we did not because we did not want to get emotionally disturbed or challenged from the job that we had to do but for the families there was no other job you wanted life to go on as normal but in your heart it couldn't have been anything close to normal no friends of mine told me that I was in a daze really the house was packed and I just had to be myself and I I just left everyone and I've gone is the bathroom and I kneeled on the tile floor and prayed it was much worse for the level kids at school and everybody came up to me and said I'm so sorry your dad's gonna die April 14th 21 hours after the explosion the crippled ship rounded the far side of the Moon in the midst of this incredibly tense and stressful flight we're in many ways this crew was fighting for their lives you got to see something you'd never seen before what was that experience like well it it was obviously to me great to have the opportunity even just loop around the moon Jack and I did a lot of sightseeing as we went around the back side Lovell who had already circled the moon in Apollo 8 got a little impatient with all the photos he shipmates we're taking and I tell him if I he you know if we don't get back you're not going to get them developed you are basically running a bare-bones operation at that time you are shutting down everything you can because everything aboard that module drains power and you need all the power you can you can save exactly right and we had to turn off all the electrical systems and that's when the temperature kept dropping we'd like to do go down that far down four-figure we knew it was going to get as cold as a meat locker inside that spacecraft so in other words you're saying look guys you're going to be cold and thirsty and hungry for four days but you're going to go through that because if we do anything else that you're not getting home that's correct so how cold did you get it would spot the temperature of your refrigerator it got pretty missable we had got out of storage all our spare underwear so we had three sets of underwear on what about food how much food did you have we didn't eat much food we the water was freezing and the flute us getting frozen - too cold to eat too cold to sleep I found out that I could be it from the instrument panel put my fingers together close my eyes and for about three minutes be asleep wake up and refreshed and so that's essentially the actually the sleep the week out of the way home April fifteenth thirty hours after the explosion something else threatened to kill them something they couldn't even see in layman's terms your own exhalation the fact that the three of you breathing out were creating so much carbon dioxide that it was going to kill you that that's absolutely correct remember the lunar module was only designed to support two men for two days it's air purifiers were maxed out the dead command module was still attached they could get more filters there but they were the wrong shape square and wouldn't fit the round openings in the LEM that of course is a big engineering goof that we didn't have the same canister for both sides we gotta come up with the solution here engineers had to design an adapter literally make a square peg fit in a round hole they had to do it quickly and they could only use what was on the spacecraft part of a flight manual plastic bags duct tape they did a mock-up of it down on the ground in Houston and then they told you basically how to do it and you must have thought they were crazy yeah they said I'll take three feet of duct tape and we said what three feet they said yeah an arm's-length of duct tape with hood the strange-looking contraption worked it saved their lives and for two more days cold hungry sleepless the three astronauts hunkered down and wheeled their way home at some point Mission Control instructed you to stop sending your urine out of the spacecraft and some people might think that's the ultimate indignity these guys are in a tough enough Strait as it is what was the reason for that well what they said was we don't want any unbalanced force on the vehicles because we want to get you back at that free return course for a safe approach through the atmosphere and the landing of us so when you expel urine it would change the course load it's like a little rocket so now you've got bags of urine floating around in the spacecraft as well I'll have you try to try to figure out where to put that they all but stop drinking water dehydration set in Fred Hayes soon developed an infection and fever that was all bad but now even as Earth loomed in the window there was yet another crisis they call up and said we have extrapolated your course all the way back to the earth and you're going to miss the atmosphere we were drifting yeah by 60 or 80 nautical miles which meant all of it it says that hey you're gone nearly four days after the crippling explosion as Apollo 13 against all odds seemed about to make it home Mission Control discovered something potentially devastating the spacecraft was drifting off the traditionalist was drifting off and we didn't understand what was happening Apollo 13 was going to come in too shallow bounced off the Earth's atmosphere and be lost forever we have to pull perform another emergency maneuver the engineers calculated the precise direction and amount of rocket thrust needed to correct the course then the crew had to make it happen firing the Rockets manually steering by sighting the Earth and Moon through the windows nobody had ever done that before this was a team effort right I mean you're handling one aspect trying to keep the earth from moving up and down and Fred Hayes was going you know to keep it from going sideways of course he's sick at this time and jack is timing it because our clock had stopped the course were you worried at all Jean that after all they had been through over those three or four days the the cold the sleep deprivation the tension and the stress that they may just make a simple mistake that they simply weren't up to the task of getting home no no this is the kind of relationship that we must have with our crew the crew totally depends upon us to come up the right answers we depend upon them to provide the information to execute so so no room for second-guess a ship is absolute absolute Trust is really the key go for the burn for burning for T brother and the crew made the tricky maneuver like they'd done it a thousand times okay that was a good burn Friday April 17th just hours from Earth now the astronauts needed to get back into the command module it had been shut down frozen for days engineers on the ground were working feverishly on a way to start it up again we went through four different versions of this checklist we have a procedure for getting power from the lamp not very long procedure and I got a little testing it I said look it give us the proper information no more no less it was a critical time normally the command module was powered up before launch when electricity was unlimited never had a command module been shut down in flight then restarted with just battery power if the batteries died so would the crew and you talk about this procedure over 500 steps and they had to then radio those steps and they had to be written down one after the other we had no blank paper so we had to rip covers and backs off of checklist and use that to write this checklist which was very lengthy now checklist in hand three cold hungry sleepless men had to execute it perfectly okay you're going to start the piling up the command module right hours right now the command module did come fully up you know fully fully powered up sigh of relief there I mean that's your that's your ride home it was ride home ready or not back in the command module now less than five hours from earth the crew jettisoned the part of the spacecraft that exploded and nearly killed them all copy that service module separation after 138 hours a few minutes eight seconds for the very first time they could see just how bad the damage was is it floated away finally just in front of us we saw that the entire panel had been blown out and 105 isn't right finally I get into the whole panel is blown out almost probably uh faithfully I engine and that had to set up some fears in this room that that explosion also damaged the heat shield on the command module because they sit right next to each other and would they be able to survive reentry in our line of business you only worry about those things that you can do something about so all the things you had done for the four days prior all the heroic efforts of everyone would have been for naught had there been a major flaw in that heat shield it just wouldn't matter that's right there's nothing we could do about it there we could go outside to repair or anything like that so we just we just took it for granted that the heat shield was going to the attack next they jettison the lamp their lifeboat which they've nicknamed Aquarius it was time Marilyn you seem like a tough gal however there had to be times when you went over in your mind how you would tell the kids if it didn't turn out well actually I really don't believe I really thought about it because I really didn't give up I just knew he'd become bad it had been the moon mission people ignored and now the whole world was watching he couldn't breathe we all just sat there and we just held our breath and we held it with the world Apollo 13 plunged into the Earth's atmosphere on Friday April 17 after nearly six days in space during reentry the 5,000 degree fireball surrounding the ship blacked out all radio transmissions the crew is now on their own no more givebacks the blackout was expected to last four minutes any by for any reports of acquisition there's no response and we call again it's now one minute since we should have heard from this crew Apollo 13 should be not a blackout at this time every controller in this room is standing staring at those clocks in the law one minute 27 seconds after we should have heard from the crew he got a hope okay we're in jet and the emotional release in this room is so intense that literally every controller is standing trying Apollo 15 is practically at the time when that spacecraft splashed outta water came over the over the windows I said hey we're home with their handshakes in the capsule were their tears what was going on in there it was just quiet that we accepted each other's hand and he said then repeat it again capsule was still cold even after entry of smoky air crossed the airport out of the hatch when a diver opened the hatch and the screw that been living in a meat locker assignment out the warm pair of a South Pacific in their home and they are alive what was the first thing you said to Maryland when you got back to her I said we can't this without me you can't get rid of me value that's right but here are the facts of Apollo 13 to this day 40 years later no human beings have ever ventured farther from home and to this day no astronauts have overcome so many disasters large and small to make it back alive"

moonlanding,"Positron Dynamics is out to make space travel to distant stars a reality using antimatter. Antimatter is the most energy-dense material known. Positrons are the easiest form of antimatter to produce. With physics that is understood today, any hopes of traveling beyond the edge of the Solar System can only be realized with antimatter. To get there, our first steps lie in Earth’s orbit.","Antimatter Propulsion - Ryan Weed, CEO of Positron Dynamics",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2pWv-D84W0,0,733795,6701,576,1529,n2pWv-D84W0,you know I usually don't start these talks with a graph or a plot of data it's not that exciting but I'll make an exception here because a couple months ago a group of scientists astronomers from all around the world published in nature magazine something groundbreaking and it was this graph I know it looks kind of like a jumble of plots of data but it shows a wobble and what was that wobble well turns out that all of these data plots are looking at the exact position of a star our closest star that's Proxima Centauri it's about 44 light years away which is still pretty far 35 million million kilometers but still it's pretty close in galactic terms and they're looking at the exact position of That star because they had a feeling that there might be a planet next to it so this wobble that you see there on the graph is the actual star moving because of the gravitational pull of a very small planet orbiting right around it and based on the period or the or the width of that wobble and the amplitude of that while what we can infer that there is in fact a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri it turns out that this planet is in the habitable zone which means there could be liquid water and there could be life there it's kind of lucky that our closest star turns out to have a planet that might have life so that gives us the idea of we should we should go there right we should go and see what's there and there's a problem with that and that are traditional Rockets which originally were developed in the 1920s the technology hasn't changed significantly since then Robert Goddard there on the Left developed liquid propulsion in 1924 and then 50 year later we launched on the right Voyager 1 that's the fastest human or man-made object that we've ever created now it goes about 15 kilometers per second I'll just imagine that speed going 15 kilometers every second now it seems pretty fast but unfortunately in terms of distances in space it's pretty slow if you want to get to Mars it would take you months and you know there are several people trying to do that now Elon Musk for example NASA if you want to go to outer solar system which NASA just did took them 10 years to get there and a billion dollars 150 million kilometers away take you years to get to get there with current technology but the real the real problem is that if you want to get outside of our solar system to that closest star system Alpha Centauri it'll take you thirty thousand years to get there I don't want to wait around that long I want to go there sooner so we have to figure out a way to get there sooner you know it turns out that we're actually humans are actually very good at developing exploration tools ways of getting us to places we've never been before we harness the power of wind we were able to measure the position of the stars and the Sun very accurately we were able to measure time very accurately this allowed us to sail the seas and explore and allowed for the golden age of exploration we were able to harness the power of chemical energy combustion aerodynamics we mastered the skies but if we really want to go beyond that outside of our solar system we need to find a new technology when able we need to be able to harness that new technology to get to our closest stars in a human lifetime so I'll look at a couple different options here there are a lot of very smart people working on this there are some options in terms of what technology we can we can harness to get outside of our solar system whether it be nuclear fusion laser propulsion or my field which is antimatter so this is project Icarus it's a very large fusion rocket based on fusing together very light light isotopes of hydrogen to create nuclear energy the only problem with this is that you need a very massive initial amount of energy to catalyze that reaction it's so it turns out you know I have the Eiffel Tower there and then next to that the Saturn 5 rocket which actually allowed us to get to the moon it's a huge project requires a lot of investment and also in Urschel confinement fusion has yet to be demonstrated in the lab so this is challenging but still a pretty cool project the other option laser propulsion recently there's been a project called the breakthrough initiatives that have looked into using a very powerful set of lasers to accelerate a very small sort of coffee-table sized mirror very high velocities you know this would work you need you need about 10 gigawatts of power you need that's about the same amount of power as 10 nuclear power plants by the way so it's very challenging but still the physics is there for this to happen now you know my background is an antimatter so let's talk about antimatter right what is it so a lot of people think that antimatter is theoretical it hasn't been discovered yet so it's actually been around since the 1920s Paul Dirac who was a famous physicist quantum physicist was working on combining special relativity Einstein's theories with quantum mechanics so we solved this equation for the relativistic quantum mechanics of energy of a particle and he came out with positive and negative energy solutions and he said wait a minute maybe the negative energy solutions are a whole new class of particles of course everyone thought he was a little crazy just because he came out with a negative solution to this equation and he's saying oh that's a whole new class of particles but a few year later at Caltech call Anderson saw this it's actually a track for a part of a particle a high-energy particle going through a cloud chamber and it's actually curving the wrong way in a magnetic field so Carl saw this and he knew about Dirac's result and he said wait a minute this could be antimatter this could be the mirror type matter that fall Dirac predicted so that was 1932 and so antimatter has been around since then annihilation it's the most important thing about antimatter so when you have an antimatter particle and you have another matter particle and they come close enough together there is a probability that both particles will disappear and form pure energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation so what does that mean in terms of applications so it means if you have a clump of antimatter it has a very high energy density in order to put that into more familiar terms say you had a hundred grains of antimatter salt at 19 mega joules for microgram it's the highest energy density of any any substance in the universe 100 grains of that would have the same amount of energy as all the rocket fuel on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket so you can see how a little bit of antimatter packs a pretty big punch that's what originally got me interested in antimatter as an undergrad and what it still interest me today about it so what was the original concept of antimatter propulsion you know and back in the 1950s we had known about antimatter and a scientist from Germany called Eugene Sanger came up with this idea of an antimatter rocket the idea was that you'd produce enough antimatter store it in your rocket annihilate it with corresponding matter and then direct that energy in the direction of your rocket nozzle so that you can have propulsion there's a couple problems with this and these are the reasons that we don't have antimatter Rockets right now is that one you can't produce enough antimatter for this to be realistic secondly you can't trap it antimatter as soon as it touches matter will annihilate so you can't use normal matter to trap antimatter the other problem is that when you annihilate antimatter it forms very high-energy radiation which is very difficult to direct with normal matter so those are some challenges that we faced in developing an antimatter propulsion concept so I thought about these problems finishing up my PhD and in 2011 and we came up with a couple a couple of reasons why antimatter propulsion wasn't feasible at the time one of them is called moderation moderation is the process of going from hot to cold and in antimatter physics that process is traditionally very inefficient so the state of the art in 2011 was to take your hot antimatter antimatter when it's created is created at a million times hotter than the surface of the Sun very difficult to control so what you did back then was you run it through a very thin layer of metal and you're just hoping that one part one of these positrons will diffuse through that metal and reach the surface of course a lot of them hit an electron on the way and you lose it to annihilation but about one in a thousand made it through so the process of moderation was about you lose 999 out of a thousandth of 0.1 percent efficient so we were thinking of ways of making this process better and we came up with a little sketch an idea put it down on paper that turned into a patent we applied for some funding and got some funny to try it out and then a couple years ago we found that the concept for our positron moderator actually works we sort of incorporated that into a more remastered producible design and so this little positron moderator is the sort of the heart of any of our positron propulsion concepts so building a team with that asked some friends hey you guys want to stop working on chemical rockets and maybe bill an antimatter rocket company of course they said yes started out in a little office building with some equipment and our initial funding quickly found out that you can't do nuclear physics in an office building we got kicked out and then found a little more appropriate facilities and actually in a old nuclear fallout shelter a couple years ago so the idea is to integrate some of this into what's called a CubeSat to demonstrate the technology cube SATs are modular small satellite that are easily launch Apple so how do we overcome those three problems that I talked about well the first to production of antimatter and trapping of antimatter we overcome that by using a radioisotope which is a middle of positrons constantly emitting positrons over its lifetime we run that through a positive or positron moderator which in turn produces a very high intensity called positron source so rather than using energy onboard a spacecraft to generate antimatter or using energy to trap antimatter we combine those two processes into one and finally in order to direct the antimatter we can't direct gamma rays which we get from annihilation but the energy from the gamma rays can be converted to a charged particle via nuclear reaction so we then have a very energetic charged particle which is the perfect recipe for producing a rocket because magnetic fields are actually very good at directing charged particles so what does it mean for performance of a rocket so the exit velocity of these charged particles about a thousand times faster than in a chemical rocket moving at about 10% the speed of light that means you can develop a rocket that would propel something thousand times faster than traditional chemical rockets that means going to Mars and weeks Pluto or outer solar system in months or if you wanted to go to Alpha Centauri you could get there in about four years which is less than a human lifetime now you can't really develop a business plan based on going to Alpha Centauri it's very difficult to convince investors to give you money for that but what you can't do is develop a very efficient propulsion mechanism for things in low-earth orbit we know over the next 10 years there's a lot of companies planning to launch constellations of satellites of a thousand or more satellites into low-earth orbit for the purposes of earth imaging broadband internet so this is where we're really looking at to add our capability to to these low Earth orbit constellations of satellites which you know they need to be able to maneuver and our our system will allow them to do that a little bit further down the road several government agencies SpaceX some private companies are planning to go to nearby planets Mars and then a little bit further down the road in ten years or so you have companies like Planetary Resources a company that wants to go out in the asteroid belt and mine actual asteroids for things like water spacecraft fuel rich elements like platinum so that's that's our our business side of things so you know I always like to come back to why do we want to explore space because that's what I'm interested in you know I think it really the real question is not why we explore space because they're you know they're been plenty of technologies that have come out of the space race but the more fundamental question is why do we explore in the first place and I think it's part of our as part of who we are as humanity in humanity I think it's part of our DNA to wanting to challenge ourselves to want to go to places we've never been before so I think we can't change that and and to deny that would be wrong so with this new revelation that there is a earth-like planet orbiting the closest star that is the catalyst for the new space race and I'm happy to be part of it so thank you very much guys
moonlanding,"Elon Musk gave the biggest talk of his life in Guadalajara, Mexico, where he detailed his plans to set up a self-sustaining colony of 1 million people on Mars. He knows the rockets and spaceships he wants to build, but many questions still need to be answered if he wants to pull off such an ambitious feat. The Verge's Loren Grush breaks down some of the challenges with input from Bill Nye (CEO of The Planetary Society) and Will Pomerantz (VP Special Projects, Virgin Galactic).

 here is to make Mars seem possible. Make it seem as though it’s something we
 can do in our lifetimes. Loren: Elon Musk finally told the world his
 vision for colonizing Mars — and it proved to be one hell of a show. His talk in Mexico drew insane crowds. People actually stampeded into the hall where
 he spoke to get a good seat. They were then treated to a one-hour breakdown
 of all the vehicles Musk wants to build to take humans to the Red Planet. So let’s unwrap all of this, and talk about
 what it means. It starts off like any science fiction: you
 need a spaceship. A vehicle to carry up to 100 passengers, maybe
 more, and 450 tons of cargo to Mars. First, the spaceship will be launched into
 Earth orbit, thanks to a massive rocket booster. And I mean massive. When completed, this rocket would be bigger
 and more powerful than NASA’s Saturn V rocket. The thing would be powered by a combination
 of 42 Raptor engines. That’s the new powerful engine that SpaceX
 has been working on. The company just did its first full-scale
 test of the engine the other day too. But unlike the kerosene engines that power
 the Falcon 9, these engines run on methane. More on why later. So the booster takes the spaceship into orbit. The two vehicles separate and the booster
 comes back to land on Earth. It’s one of SpaceX’s signature moves,
 similar to how the Falcon 9 lands post-launch. But once that booster lands, it quickly gears
 up for its next launch of a propellant tank. That tank then docks with the spaceship in
 orbit, filling it up with the “gas” it needs to get to Mars. Musk said it’d take maybe three to five
 propellant tanks to fully fuel the spaceship’s trip. Then the spaceship is off to Mars. Once it arrives, the entire thing lands using
 its engines to lower itself down to the ground. It’s a technique called supersonic retro
 propulsion, and again it’s just like the Falcon 9 landings. It’s also a way of getting super heavy payloads
 safely down to Mars, which doesn’t have a very thick atmosphere to help slow falling
 objects. After letting out its passengers, eventually
 the spaceship will lift off and come back to Earth. And where will it get the fuel for that return
 trip? On Mars. That’s why SpaceX is using methane, because
 it can be made from the carbon dioxide in the planet’s atmosphere and possible subsurface
 water. That saves SpaceX from bringing over all of
 the fuel for the return trip beforehand. Will Pomerantz: Elon and the team at SpaceX
 have showed really well that nothing speaks for itself quite like results. So I think the most important thing for Elon
 and for everyone who backs Elon and the team at SpaceX who do it, is to go out and take
 some of these technologies that that he showed off today like the giant composite tanks and
 the raptor engines and just keep developing those and keep testing those. Loren: So sounds like he’s thought it through,
 right? Well for all that he did say, Musk left out
 a few key parts about his human settlement idea. Namely, how these people are going to survive. A good analogy for living on Mars is kind
 of like living in Antarctica… but worse. Bill Nye: We have a science base in Antarctica
 all the time, hundreds of people there, all the time. But you don't go there to raise a family,
 you don't build playgrounds. I love SpaceX, I love what they are doing,
 it is fantastic. They have changed the way people think about
 space exploration. But I don't think you want a colony on Mars,
 I'm open minded of course, but it... I just, if you've ever been to Antarctica
 there's nothing to eat. There is nothing to drink. And, uh, you can breathe. On Mars you can't breathe. You can't breathe, everybody, that's serious. Yet Musk said nothing about the types of habitats
 people would live in on Mars, and very little about how they would eat, drink, and breathe. And when asked about certain dangers to human
 health posed by a space voyage — like deep-space radiation or solar flares — he had this
 to say. Elon Musk: So, I actually think the radiation
 thing is often brought up, but I think it is not too big of a deal. There's some risk of radiation, um, but its
 not deadly. Loren: There was also little talk of in-space
 life-support systems or perhaps the biggest issue of all: microgravity. Living in space can lead to severe bone density
 and muscle loss. And things at Mars may not be much better. The planet has one-third the gravity of Earth,
 which could also wreak havoc on the body. We don’t know yet. But for SpaceX, these problems aren’t the
 company’s primary concern. In fact, Musk said that the first colonists
 would need to be willing to risk death. Elon Musk: I mean, the goal of SpaceX is really
 to build the transport system. Its like building the Union-Pacific Railroad. And once that transport system is built then
 there's a tremendous opportunity for anyone who wants to go to Mars and create something
 new or build the foundations of a new planet. Loren: But even some of the engineering claims
 made by Musk were a little ambitious. For instance, he claimed that the spaceship
 could eventually make the trip to Mars in just 80 days if accelerated fast enough. That’s an insane estimate given that most
 trips to Mars take upwards of 6 months. Getting to such a speed would take a lot of
 energy and then a lot of energy to brake. He also envisions not just one spaceship going
 to Mars at one time, but eventually up to 1,000. Let’s do the math there. The launch window for Mars opens up every
 26 months. So you need to launch 1,000 ships before that
 window opens up. And since each spaceship requires three fuel
 launches, that’s 3,000 launches in a 26-month time period. That’s more than 15 times the world’s
 current launch rate. And then there’s the timeline and the cost
 estimates — both of which seem super optimistic. Musk hopes to complete the first development
 spaceship in four years and then send the first big spaceship to Mars as early as 2024. That’s ambitious given SpaceX hasn’t ever
 launched people into space. He also says that factors like reusability
 and propellant production on Mars means the entire thing can be done for way less than
 current Mars estimates. The ultimate result: 1 million people living
 on mars in the next 40-100 years. But that timeline is very tentative, especially
 since SpaceX isn’t putting a lot of resources into the Mars plan just yet, though. Less than 5 percent of the company’s resources
 are going to the development of this interplanetary transport system. And even with these lower cost estimates,
 Musk says he can’t do it all alone, hinting at the need for either partnerships with NASA
 or others in the private industry. So it’s clear: this is just the starting
 off point. There’s a lot of problems to solve ahead. But Musk says there is only one way to solve
 them. Elon Musk: Technology doesn’t automatically
 improve. It only approves if a lot of really strong
 engineering talent is applied to the problem that it improves. Bill Nye: Oh yeah, just join The Planetary
 Society, don't forget that. No so, at the Planetary Society we have 52,000
 members, and now after this meeting I hope we have 53,000, of people who love space and
 want to explore space. And, uh, they are all running to the front
 row today. I mean those people, just this um, its an
 exciting time if we could lower the cost of getting to space, it would be great."

ESPN
PODCAST FULL",FIRST TAKE HD 11/13/2015 - Kevin Garnett compares Stephen Curry to Michael Jordan,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89msZiUOXRs,0,58140,465,16,77,89msZiUOXRs,the Warriors remained unbeaten after beating the Timberwolves last night Steph Curry on fire he's leading the league in scoring at nearly 32 points per game kg is fully impressed Barnett spoke to Jerry's Agoda from the Minneapolis star-tribune last night after the loss and the go-to tweeted this from their convo kg saying like Michael Jordan was a whole other thing this guy is his own thing it's beautiful for basketball Steven a you okay with kg putting Curry and MJ in the same sentence Skip Bayless Molly German let me say this yes I am really yes I am and kg who I believe even though I think he'll end up as a part owner of the Minnesota Timberwolves if he had he wanted a career in this business he could have it because he's the real deal he doesn't mince words he's gonna say what he feels and he's usually right on the money and he is as real as they come he doesn't say this lightly and it's not meant as any kind of disrespect whatsoever to the great Michael Jordan but Steph Curry I'm gonna say it right here on the airwaves right now Steph Curry is the best player in the world I'm gonna say that I know that LeBron can do more on the defensive end I know that Kevin Durant is a freak of nature but LeBron can't do what Steph Curry can do offensively and Kevin Durant doesn't want to do bad enough what Steph Curry does offensively because Steph Curry goes out there and despite having klay Thompson a member of the splash brothers and the Harrison Barnes and Andre Iguodala and all of these guys around him who are capable scorers Steph Curry gonna shoot that basketball and you know how you know if what's the ultimate testament to his greatness is he can shoot as much as he wants and nobody has a thing to say why because it's usually going in 53% shooting from the field 47% shooting I'm gonna repeat that numbers get 47% shooting from three-point range this brother is on another level and when I'm listen he can't jump like Michael Jordan he's not the aerial assault that Michael Jordan it was okay he certainly can't do defensively what Michael Jordan did and what LeBron James is capable of doing but from an offensive standpoint first of all go to st. seventh defensively by the way and Steph Curry can't play a little defense and ain't like he's a scrub on the defensive end of the floor but offensively how are you going to stop him this dude literally walks past half court and you are shivering and shaking in your proverbial boots because this brother can pull up from 40 the way some people can pull up from 10 feet away from the basket he is that lethal of a marksman I'm gonna say it again he is the greatest shooter I have ever seen in my life I have never seen anybody I'm talking about Larry Bird I'm talking about some somebody most of y'all don't know Andrew Toney you can appreciate that name skip I'm talking about Rickey Paris I'm talking about Dell curry I'm talking about downtown Freddie brown from the 70s with Dennis Johnson and Jack Sikma and those boys in Seattle with the supersonic I don't care who you pick I have never in my life seen a basketball player who can shoot the basketball the way that Steph Curry can and because of that level of paranoia that he instills in a defender that's what makes him comparable to Michael Jordan it's not just the efficiency it's the fear he instills it's the way he demoralizes you cuz what you gonna do you can't block a shot from 30 or 40 feet this is how lethal this kid is and that is why I think the comparison to Michael Jordan in terms of impact is exactly what kg was alluding to I think he is right on the money because he scares the living hell out of the defenders his marksmanship he is changing the game it is beautiful for basketball because guess what you don't have to be 6 6 and above flying through the air in order to be proficient you can't be six three what a J and make noise in the National Basketball Association he is changing the complexion of how basketball should be it is something special to bold it is that I hear everything you just said and I don't love what kg did I'm sorry just don't go there yet it's just this is unfair to Steph I'm sorry to put him in the same sentence even though what Kevin was saying was what Michael did in this area is is very special and now what he's doing staff over here in this area is very special he wasn't saying Steph's better than Michael he's just saying both things very special to watch mm-hmm I get that but too many people will now connect the dots to say wait a second he's Steph better than Michael Jordan look I'm the biggest Jordan fan on the plot that planet I I said though before Steph's draft I'm gonna remind you again I said take him number one over Blake Griffin and people laughed at me are you kidding that skinny little kid from David you'd take him over Blake Griffin yes I would because of the handle and the range it's just I've never seen it before you know what he reminds me of when I was a little kid I would go see the Harlem Globetrotters every years when I'm a little kid it's a long time ago but Meadowlark lemon was doing things that were magic on the court like no human can do that magic trick on the court like shoot a hook shot from half court as if it's a free throw and make it and Steph is shooting threes as if they're layups like you say he's making almost half of them well he's making five point two a game the record he set last year four per game threes three point six now again we're only ten games into the season but it is it's we've never seen this before I thought Pete Maravich this is a little before your time but but in college there's no 3-point line but he was shooting these kind of shots but not like this like like I thought that was something now this is another level of that but remember just for the record now just for perspective Michael Jordan could destroy you on both ends of the floor offensively defensively he could shoot it okay pretty well outside well enough outside and he attack the basket like no one's ever attacked the basket and get to the free-throw line and make all the clutch shots and then he could go to the other end and just terrorize you he could take you out of what you do on the defensive end I'm sorry I can't I can't connect those dots just yet let me say something to you that I've never said to you on this show it might be in all probability and exercise in futility but I think that I can possibly change your mind let me take a shot right when you look at Steph Curry we understand what you're saying about the defensive end of the floor what kg is talking about is somebody that literally changes the complexion of a game the level of fear that he instills in you if you remember Michael Jordan before the championships when he couldn't get through the Pistons it got to a point where you saw this kid coming and you're like good lord have mercy his second year in the league when he dropped 63 on Boston and magic and Larry Bird called him the closest thing that God he had ever seen the piston said damn all that bad boy Pistons wrote Dumars and Isaiah and Lam beer in Rodman and Mahorn and all of these voids they said we gonna put something on you Chuck dilly to Jordan rules sort of world I am telling you right now the reason why this is relevant to Steph Curry is because I ain't wish it he's my favorite player and we live in a different agent we are not advocating violence but ignorant and individuals out there who are trying to interpret it as such at some point in time somebody gonna try to put in some Steph rules just like I had to put in a jitter rule because it just makes no sense he comes past half court and pulls up anywhere and has a total green light and by the way his teammates get mad at him when he doesn't shoot because that's how lethal he is from who else other than Jordan has ever had that kind of green light not even Kobe had that kind of green light he might have taken it but he didn't have it because even when he did it there were people that would get annoyed with it or whatever nobody's got a problem with steps just like gonna have a problem with Michael Jordan because this dog skills let me read these numbers to you thirty-three point three points very Jordan esque 53% shooting for the field very Jordan s sure not from the three-point range 47% that wasn't Jordan national 92 percent from the free-throw line the man doesn't miss from anywhere he sleep he shoots in asleep he shoots awake he shoots on the left side the right side the corner to wing the key the top of the key bad pass Hoefler it didn't matter any place he throws the ball up it goes in nobody has had that kind of impact offensively and you can appreciate this point skip when you have that kind of impact offensively it demoralizes guys when they're on offense because they might overcompensate it's similar to what's happening with the Patriots they're so precise and such perfectionist at what they do that normalcy doesn't apply when you're going against the Patriots you see folks engaging in trickery and trying extra things cuz they're going against Tom Brady and Bill Belichick all right that's what you're going to see people hi I got off covered okay two quick questions hypothetical okay if there were an all-time draft in which you could draft that player and in his young prime okay just start your franchise with weirwood stuff go in that all-time draft you could drop it anybody for who compared key anyone any more time start it who would go number one Michael would Michael Jordan thank Michael Jordan for me but what I'm saying to you is this it's not eclipsing nobody said that what you're talking about what Michael Jordan let's understand that for us Bill Russell the ultimate champion with 11 championships in 13 years Michael Jordan the greatest most of us have ever seen so when you're talking about somebody what you're asking is not who's better who meant who deserves to be mentioned in the same sentence to save breath in terms of impact what you're seeing from Steph Curry right now is comparable to what they said about Michael Jordan great job he was going and that's what I'm saying if you custom say magic and his young primer Stefan his young prime with that boy I'd go man let me tell you why intangible oh no I don't know I understand it's 9 I understand that but what I'm saying to you is this magic in terms of impact and the troops around him being made to look better I'm not looking at that I understand magic it's that edge I'm talking about in terms of ability ok my god Oh last quick question quick question hypothetical draft going into this season if any GM could could draft a player to start with just this year just as in what we say on the the current players who would go number 1 in that draft going into this I think they would say LeBron would say we're all wrong I am Telling You right now okay what I'm seeing offensively from this kid skip when you shoot this accurately and you create your own shot you need some spot up shooter like a Steve Kerr John Paxson somebody you boogying off way on the old journal create you know how much I love Chris Paul you know how much I love Russell Westbrook as players this brothers on another level I mean right now Steph Curry I'm gonna say it I'm gonna be I'm gonna say it because I think Kevin Durant is one of the top three players on the planet and obviously LeBron is I'm gonna say right now what we're seeing these first 10 games that right now Steph Curry is the best player on Earth and we might not have even seen the best and I'm saying I'm saying it cuz you but you got a score you could beat this with championships you got score points to win games yeah and this brother right here it's on another level it's on another level I mean that weighted love it yes or no we've seen the best of him or you think there's another guy I can't if it's it should be unlawful for him to be better than he okay I mean if he's better than this alright then what's it say he leads the league in threes in his second in the league with layups as well just so impressive ridiculous season Oscar De La Hoya writes a letter to Floyd in Playboy magazine it starts dear Floyd it's classic

China Is The First To Land On The Dark Side Of The Moon",China Is The First To Land On The Dark Side Of The Moon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWlxoU5DpLk,0,269192,5215,232,1345,JWlxoU5DpLk,"a space mission has touched down on the far side of the moon. China's Chang'e-4 probe
 landed in the oldest and deepest basin on the moon's surface, making the mission a
 milestone for both China and space exploration as a whole. This isn't the first time
 China has landed on the moon. In 2013 Chang'e-3 successfully
 touched down on Mare Imbrium, a huge lava plain on the moon's surface. But until now, China has never explored the moon's mysterious dark side. No one has. That's actually why it's
 called the dark side. It's not hidden from the sun,
 it's hidden from our view. That's because the moon
 is in what's called synchronous rotation with the Earth, which means every time the
 moon rotates once on its axis, it also completes one
 orbit around the Earth. As a result, we see the same
 face of the moon every night. In fact, we only got our
 first glimpse of the far side in 1959, when the Soviet
 Union's Luna 3 took pictures as it flew by. And while we've had numerous landings on the near side of the moon, no one's attempted to touch
 down on the far side before, and for good reason. It's impossible to communicate
 with anything over there. Any signal would get blocked
 by the rest of the moon. But China's team has a solution. They launched a relay
 satellite with a clear view of both Chang'e-4 and the Earth. And so far, the plan's working. Here are the very first
 images taken by Chang'e-4, the first in history ever
 taken from the surface on the dark side of the moon. What's more, you're looking at the oldest, largest, and deepest basin the moon has. Chang'e-4 landed on Von Karman, a flat landscape that sits
 inside South Pole-Aitken Basin. The basin is around
 2,500 kilometers across. That's about the distance
 from New York to Dallas. And it's a whopping eight kilometers deep. For comparison, the deepest
 natural point on Earth, the Challenger Deep, is
 nearly 11 kilometers deep. Next, the lander will release a rover that will explore the surrounding area. One of it's tasks is to
 study the composition of rocks and dirt in the basin. Since scientists believe
 this is the oldest basin on the moon, learning what
 it's made of might help us understand how Earth's only
 moon formed and evolved. But that's only one goal of the mission. Besides cameras and spectrometers, Chang'e-4 also brought along
 potatoes and silkworm eggs. Researchers hope to test
 how well plants can grow and eggs can hatch in
 the moon's low gravity. It's the first mini
 greenhouse to ever land on another world in our solar system, and might help prepare us for
 space colonies in the future."
moonlanding,"In a major milestone in space exploration, a Chinese spacecraft for the first time ever touched down on the moon’s far side. Scientists hope the mission will provide more about how our planetary system was formed. NBC’s Tom Costello reports for TODAY.

moonlanding,"A Chinese spacecraft has become the first ever to land on the far side of the moon. It's carrying instruments to analyse the area's geology and represents a milestone in space exploration. Caitlin McGee has the details.
#China #MoonLanding #Spacecraft",China Moon Landing: Spacecraft makes first landing on dark side,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeXr2GK2D9w,0,7508,113,16,63,VeXr2GK2D9w,the dark side of the moon has been unexplored until now the Chinese spacecraft Chunghwa four is the first to land here and on the side that permanently faces away from Earth the whole process of the probes powered descent and landing is the most essential part of our overall mission and it has laid a foundation for the craft to land roam and explore later the spacecraft landed on the 60 kilometer wide Vaughn command crater near the moon's South Pole its job is to study rocks in the moon's geology the lander will also carry out various experiments including weather plant seeds and silkworm eggs can grow on the moon and without signal interference from Earth to achieve all of this cheng'er 4 will transmit all its data back home via a relay satellite the other side the moon is constantly facing space and the meteorites and energetic particles so that surface has been changed over time and the first picture that we have seen from this lander shows the surface or not yet in the detail that we're going to see but it already shows very Aroldis surface from from those impacts so this is something that's very interesting to study because it shows what the space environment we lead us to objects in space this isn't china's at first moon landing in 2013 Beijing's Space Agency joined the United States and Russia by landing a rover on the moon's earth-facing side but this landing is considered its biggest space achievement and is one of a series of missions that could boost the country's ambitions to join in some say even lead the space race Caitlin McGee TRT world you
moonlanding,"A new milestone in space exploration was achieved overnight when a lunar probe made a successful landing on the far side of the moon.

The breakthrough mission wasn't launched by NASA, or Russia, though, but the burgeoning Chinese space programme.

And this technically challenging landing could herald a new era of space exploration, with China increasingly taking a lead.

have a very good start the space race is back and there's a new contender in the early hours of this morning China said it had boldly gone where none had ever gone before landing it said an uncrewed spacecraft for the first time on the rugged and little-studied far side of the moon the first image of the remote surface shows a crater within a crater beamed back to earth via a relay satellite the Changi 4 probe will survey lunar geology look for minerals and conduct biological experiments to Mission Control was delighted well know India sure you've gone you can beast again I think this is a milestone humans have never been there but we did it this is trailblazing building a space power is a dream that we persistently pursue and we're gradually realizing it the far side of the Moon has fascinated stargazers for centuries the view we get of the moon from the earth is always the same though because its orbit is locked to ours this means that the time it takes for the moon to spin once on its axis is exactly the same time as it takes the moon to turn round the earth once now the moon's orbit is slightly elliptical which means that from time to time we get a slightly different view but 41% of the moon surface the far side is always hidden from Earth's view this is the conventional view the near sight of the moon taken by this very telescope at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich we can't see the far side of the moon that's that's the key thing we're not going to see that from anywhere on earth at any time China's claim of actually landing a vessel there has put the rest of the world on notice we are we we have something on the far side of the Moon it's somewhere we've never been before we don't know what information we're going to get it's also part of sort of China's sort of strategy it's another checkpoint they've got loads of really sort of I mean ambitions you know maybe fairly soon and in some sense we might have people on the moon again so it's definitely an amazing achievement although China's space program started during the Cold War it was soon eclipsed by the Russians and Americans but it invested heavily and by 2013 joined the two existing powers to land a spacecraft on the near Side of the Moon now China appears to have achieved something no other space powers even tried NASA congratulated them saying it was a first for Humanity and an impressive accomplishment somewhat overshadowing their own news a snowman like photo released yesterday of the most distant object ever explored in the Solar System frontiers come in all shapes and sizes the far side of the Moon in space terms is practically on Earth doorstep and it is China you got there first well I'm joined now from Houston Texas by former NASA astronaut David wolf and here by Alexandra stickings research analyst for space policy and security at Lucy Alexandra stickings first just give us a sense of how much of a milestone you think this is it is a huge milestone and we do need to recognize it for what it is which is a fantastic technical achievement and what we'll get from this mission and our understanding of the moon the formation of the solar system as so many other scientific advancements is just fantastic and will it trigger a new space race I mean for example will it pave the way for China to colonize the moon do you think well I think using the term space race I can be a bit problematic the space race as we initially understood it was between the US and the Soviet Union and it was during a very you know specific geopolitical time with the Cold War space has become much more democratized now we're seeing more States more commercial actors becoming involved and certainly China's rhetoric has been very much about the benefits for Humanity and we have seen believe that there is some part of that absolutely and part of their willingness for international cooperation in in scientific space exploration but we do have to also understand what China has been doing closer to earth with no military space application come back to that but David Wolff do you see sort of benign thing I mean relations between America and China have been pretty fractious recently could this make matters worse this new race or do you think it's left it more benign than that I see this as a great opportunity the the place we do want to cooperate as a common globe a planet is in exploration civil space and in commercialization the industrialization of the earth-moon system that's already begun it needs to happen in an orderly way predictability is crucial to any industrialization I think it's a fabulous achievement and it's part of China or any other country becoming a part of the productive international space enterprise but I mean clearly the Pentagon has some worries about what China might get up to in space mean last year they said that China's space program was central to modern warfare does that anxiety stir you at all so a tool a fabulous technology technological advancement can be used as a weapon to destroy or it can be used as a tool to build and the goal we and the United States have is to have such an important valuable productive global space enterprise that any country would much rather be a part of that floating all boats higher then take part in destroying it well let me put that back to Alessandra stickiness because I'm enjoying it what do they actually want to do in space given that what 2007 they tested and an anti-satellite missiles didn't they which spot worries around the world they did they destroyed one of their own weather satellites as a demonstration of this capability the problem with it is that it created a huge amount of space debris which is a problem for all orbiting satellites they have also looked at developing what we call non kinetic capabilities which could disable satellites and when we think about space in terms of military applications it's about information so it's dominating the the flow of information from satellites ensuring that the information gets to them whilst also looking at ways to disrupt that information flow to their adverse well David wolf let me ask you personally would you have liked to have landed on the moon of course most people of my generation and would love do any kind of spaceflight I was lucky to do it four times I think it's great though that I trained in Russia as a cosmonaut with the Tycho knots and we would speak in Russian together even though I don't speak Chinese they don't speak English this is a place in space where we can not bring the battle lines you might say we can leave those on earth Russia and United States other countries have had strains on earth and met their commitments in space beautifully in the international space station even as far back as Apollo Soyuz in the 70s even in the harshest of the cold war times we were able to cooperate in space what about Mars then I mean will Elon Musk for example beat the Chinese to Mars he said I think just yesterday it was that he'd colonized Mars within a decade maybe within seven years is that possible well with a big enough program it may be possible I'm not sure you can grow a baby in five months I'm throwing enough money at it but that sounds a little cool to colonize Mars is a bigger deal but the first steps the ones we're taking now are on the moon and in Earth orbit perfecting the techniques it's a bigger job than any one country or in any ten countries and it's better that we go as a unified planet and as I'm just taking is just a final thought do you think that you know is in your Moscow is Mars the way forward is that all is moon the moon the priority I think as you know as a species we've always gone to the next level so we went to the moon I think we will get to Mars at some point but but I would agree that it's it's a joint effort it has to involve international cooperation between States and those commercial companies that are making such big steps forward thank you both Alexandra stickings and David Wolff I'm sorry not to come back to you but we run out of time thank you both very much you

China’s Moon Landing, Iron Mom, And Antarctic Trek | NBC News For Universal Kids","China’s Moon Landing, Iron Mom, And Antarctic Trek | NBC News For Universal Kids",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRLm-cGj8Qc,0,6963,40,10,45,vRLm-cGj8Qc,"this is NBC News for universal kids I'm Savannah sellers and here's your Week in Review modern technology uncovering secrets of the past with the help of technology that nASA uses in space researchers in Israel are reading and preserving the historic Dead Sea Scrolls the Dead Sea Scrolls are some of the earliest written parts of the Bible they were written on parchment paper almost 2,000 years ago and were completely hidden in desert caves until 1946 it's like opening the oldest Bible in the world the paper is so old and fragile that many letters and words can't be seen and the researchers studying them can't understand the whole story it's kind of like they're putting together a puzzle but some of the puzzle pieces are invisible so they're using a process that NASA designed to help astronauts see things in the darkness of space with light a camera and a special computer words that were completely faded or covered in dirt can be seen again they took this small box which had what looked like garbage in it and all of a sudden I find words that I recognized they'll continue to use this technique to read understand and save an important window to the past China's historic landing on the far side of the Moon we can't see the far side because it never faces earth it faces the rest of the solar system the far side has a thicker crust with more deep craters than the near side the side that faces earth sometimes it's called the Dark Side of the Moon but it's not always dark it gets day and night just like the nearside 12 American astronauts have walked on the moon but only on the near side the far side of the Moon has never been explored mostly because it's hard to communicate with earth from there this landing of Changa 4 is a huge advancement for the Chinese space program it's a very difficult accomplishment and one that no country has ever done before China's space probe landed in the oldest and deepest crater on the moon since the crater is so deep scientists hope to learn something about the inside of the moon to check for minerals in the crater they're planting potato seeds with a probe to see if they'll grow a robot will explore the far side of the moon's surface and take photos other instruments will listen for new sounds in space this pioneering probe will help scientists learn something new from somewhere we've never been before and now have you seen this 2,000 snowmen and gigantic ice sculptures teams from all over the world compete at China's snow and ice festival to create huge ice palaces and other intricate designs how cool is that Colin O'Brady doing the impossible the 33 year old Explorer from Oregon is the first person to walk across Antarctica alone and unaided he didn't have anyone walking with him or delivering supplies Antarctica is all the way at the southern tip of the earth it's very windy stormy and cold with lots of snow and ice Colin had to drag all of his food and gear along in a sled since no one would be sending him supplies and he packed light bringing only two extra pairs of socks his journey began on November 3rd 2018 he passed by beautiful sights and faced raging storms that kept him in his tent and almost made him give up but he kept going for 54 days completing the 932 mile trek on December 26th that's like walking the length of the Grand Canyon three and a half times I just riding high right now back home Colin is sharing his story to inspire others this not just about me I want to share this with other people to inspire them to achieve their impossible when they want to dream big than what they set their minds to if they work towards it they can achieve anything congratulations Colin and now have you seen this blink and you'll miss 12 year old skier Jones shredding the float he came in first place at the North American skiing championships and has 22 other gold medals be sure to keep an eye on Kai he couldn't be in the Olympics one day a dynamic duo making waves pedaling and pounding the pavement Beth James is competing in a challenging race called an Ironman Triathlon she has to swim 2.4 miles then ride her bike for a hundred and 12 miles and finally run 26.2 miles that's one long race but Beth won't be swimming biking and running alone she's taking her daughter Liza along for the ride I'm beyond thankful that she is with me and I'm determined to give her the most beautiful life the family it wasn't a bad car accident when Liza was six and she can't talk or walk because of her injuries Beth took Liza out four runs in her wheelchair and her daughter loved every minute of it after competing together in shorter runs and triathlons Beth felt like they could do anything even a race as long as an Ironman so she trained for months to get ready for the big day at 7 a.m. the swim starts with Beth pulling Liza along next it's the bike ride with lots of hills that finishes biting just in time to start the run as night falls the crowd cheers and Beth and Liza finish their Amazing Race but the iron mom is already training for another race this summer and we'll be rooting for you and now have you seen this Griffon the Graduate Griffon the service dog attended every class with his owner Brittany so he just had to attend graduation in cap and gown that's real look at

How The First-Ever Moon Landing Was Re-Created In 'First Man' | Movies Insider",How The First-Ever Moon Landing Was Re-Created In 'First Man' | Movies Insider,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1CgNrjVHBU,0,415913,5038,211,1335,c1CgNrjVHBU,"""First Man"" starring Ryan Gosling follows
 Neil Armstrong's journey to become the first person to ever walk on the moon.
 No spoilers, but we all know how it turns out. But how did the filmmakers recreate
 the moon landing? This is Nathan Crowley, he's the movie's production designer. He
 told us: how he made a trip to space seem real, how he actually staged the moon
 landing, and how he managed to fit an entire rocket ship inside a soundstage
 in Atlanta. A production designer manages and designs just about everything
 physical you see in front of a camera except for costumes. Crowley has a lot of
 experience with space and flight first had to get there. Gosling rides in
 a variety of spacecraft in the movie. Crowley built the lunar module and space
 capsule to scale, meanwhile the Saturn 5 model is only 14 feet tall about 125th
 the size of the actual rocket - yet it looks exactly like it. Some of the models
 could actually move. The backdrop meanwhile showed a rough image of what
 would be happening during the scene. During some scenes, this could help
 actors get a better sense of what they were acting against in real time. Crowley
 and the crew had ample historical details to draw upon to bring the story
 to life. One of the most complicated sets convincing; floating in zero gravity. It
 involves some ingenuity. Some parts of the zero gravity sequences in ""First Man""
 involved wire work. In other parts they put the camera on the ground and film
 from below to give the appearance of being suspended in the air. This was a
 technique Stanley Kubrick pioneered on the set of ""2001: A Space Odyssey""
 which was made long before CGI. Crowley a fondness for doing things practically
 until you can't. For practical design to immerse the audience I believe
 strongly that you have to convince them that they're not
 looking at fakery so to do that you have basically they need to live in perfect
 harmony with one another and while much attention was paid to how the NASA crew
 got to space the movie also had to nail the actual moon landing. A lot of movies
 set in space will use natural scenery for planets. ""The Martian"" used the Wadi
 Rum desert in Jordan in place of Mars, and Atlanta, Georgia, and anyone who knows
 Georgia knows it's pretty green down in a nearby quarry to best capture the
 horizon line. Other parts of the moon landing were done on a soundstage where
 they lit it in just the right way to to plan it figure it out and then do it
 and if during that journey you get something more interesting because you
 hadn't foreseen something then that not to notice the design and just to be
 in the story. you"

 imagined this moment. The moment when his fellow man
 would make the first journey to the 
 Moon. Now the time had come. In the sixth decade of the 20th century,
 the ancient dream was to become a 
 reality. As we explore the reaches of space, let
 us go to the new worlds together.  Not as new worlds to be conquered,
 but as new adventures to be shared. Around the world, nearly a billion people
 watched this moment on television, as the first man from Earth prepared to set 
 foot upon the Moon. Hounston – Tranquility Base here, the 
 Eagle has landed. I'm gonna step off the LEM now. That's one small step for a man, one a giant leap for mankind. I just see it as the beginning of a new age. The mission was successfully
 completed. The Eagle had landed the
 first man on the Moon and Columbia had returned
 them safely. Wherever man journeys tomorrow
 across the ocean of our universe, history will remind him thar Apollo 11 was mankind's
 first encounter with a new world. (Lyrics: John Boswell.)

 us a magnificent ride CAPCOM Ah, Roger, 11, we'll pass that on
 and it's certainly looks like you're rolling your way now. PAO That was Neil Armstrong praising the launch
 vehicle. SC We have no complaints with any of those
 three stages on, on that, that ride. It was beautiful. CAPCOM Roger. We copy. No transients at staging
 of any significance? Over. SC That's right. It was nominal, all a good
 ride. CAPCOM Houston, roger, out. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. For your
 information we expect the maneuver to separation attitude to begin at 3 plus 05 plus 03 and
 to be completed at plus 09 plus 20. Separation at 3 plus 15 plus 00. SC Roger, time to begin maneuvers in 30503
 complete 30920 and separation 3 plus 15 00. CAPCOM Roger. That's separation should be
 3 plus 15 03, my error in reading up. SC Roger. PAO This is Apollo Control. The velocity falling

 over. SC That's affirmative. CAPCOM Roger. I read you very loud and clear,
 Buzz. Mike is pretty weak. SC Roger. We've got the high gain locked
 on now, I believe, auto tracking now. CAPCOM Okay. You're coming in loud and clear
 but Mike is just barely readable. SC That was Neil. How you reading Mike? CAPCOM Ah, loud and clear now, Mike, and we
 understand that you are docked. SC That is affirmative. SC Houston, CDR how do you read (garbled). CAPCOM 11, CDR, loud and clear, Neil. SC Okay. PAO This is Apollo Control. Apollo 11's

 BRAVO problem at separation, you were a little weak. Could you go through what you did after
 you noticed the talk-back again, please? CAPCOM We copied the primary and secondary
 propellant talkback SM RCS BRAVO 1 (garbled). SC Roger. Roger, that is affirmative and we
 moved that switch to the open position and they went back to gray. Over. PAO This is Apollo Control. We are at 34 minutes
 away from extraction from extraction from the lunar module from its adaptor in the third
 stage of the Saturn. The crew has started pressurizing the LM. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over. SC Roger. Houston, Apollo 11, go ahead. CAPCOM Roger. Could you give us some comments
 on how the transposition docking went? Over. SC I thought it went pretty well, Houston,
 although I suspect I used more gas than I've been using in the simulator. The turnaround
 maneuver, I went pitch, accel command and started to pitch up and then when I put the
 manual attitude pitch back to rate command, for some reason it, it stopped its pitch rate
 and I had to go back to excel command and hit what I thought was an extra proceed on
 the DSKY key. Then during the course of that, we drifted slightly further away from the
 S-IV B than I expected. I expected to be out about 66 feet and my guess would be I was
 around a hundred or so and, therefore, I expect I used a bit more coming back in but except
 for using a little more gas, and I'd be interested in your numbers, everything went
 nominally. CAPCOM This is Houston. Roger. We copy. PAO That was Mike Collins giving the description
 on the transposition and docking. SC This is Apollo 11. Over. SC Bruce, we're working on the pressurization
 on the LM now and working off the decal of the SM LM pressure equalization and we're
 down to Step 13 where we're waiting for the cabin pressure to be 5 or it should be
 roughly 5 before we turn the repress package O2 valve to FILL. Instead of 5 we're running
 about 4.4. Over. CAPCOM Ah, Roger. Stand by a second. SC And, Houston, Apollo 11, we just put the
 repress package O2 valve to FILL momentarily there in Step 13 and we have filled the bottles
 back up partially. What's the pressure reading on them? SC We have about 450 PSI in the, in the 3
 1-pound bottles. CAPCOM Stand by a second, please. SC Roger. Standing by. And the repress package
 valve is now in the OFF position. What's the cabin pressure now, Buzz? Cabin pressure
 is now 4.5. PAO At 3 hours 46 minutes, velocity is 18,917
 feet per second, distance from Earth 9,002 nautical miles. SC Houston, Apollo 11. We think these readings
 are within normal tolerances. We just wanted to get your concurrence before we press down
 any further with the decals. CAPCOM Okay, Captain. SC Ah, Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read? CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Go ahead. SC LM looks to be in pretty fine shape from
 about all we can see from here. CAPCOM Okay, and in reference to your question
 on this Step 13 on the decal, I understand that you have used up the contents of the
 repress O2 and at that time instead of being up to 5 PSI, you were reading 4.4. Is that
 correct? SC Okay. 4-4, yes, sir. CAPCOM Okay, and you want to know if you can
 go ahead and use additional oxygen to bring the command module up to 5,.0 and continue
 the equalization? Over. SC We think it's within normal balance,
 Bruce, but we just wanted your concurrence before we press on with this procedure. CAPCOM Roger, Apollo 11. Go ahead. SC Okay. We're pressing on with the procedure. CAPCOM And 11, Houston. We have a request
 for you. On the service module, secondary propellant fuel pressurization valve, as a
 precautionary measure, we'd like you to momentarily cycle the 4 switches to the close
 position and then release. As you know, we have no TM or talkback on these value positions
 and it's conceivable that one of them might also have been moved into a different position
 by the shock of separation. Over. SC Okay. Good idea. That's being done. CAPCOM Houston, roger. Out. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We're doing a
 non-propulsive vat on the booster at the present time. You may see some sort of a cloud coming
 out of it and when you're ready I have your evasive maneuver pad. SC Roger. That's coming out. CAPCOM Roger. Out. SC It's a haze. It's going by toward our
 minus X direction and several small particles are moving along with it. A natural velocity
 is fairly high. At least it appears to be high and we've got an O2 high, flow high
 right now. CAPCOM Houston, roger. Out. SC And Houston, you might be interested that
 out my firsthand window right now I can observe the entire continent of North America, Alaska,
 over the pole down to the Yucatan Peninsula, Cuba, northern part of South America and then
 I run out of window. CAPCOM Roger. We copy. PAO That was Neil Armstrong with that report. SC Houston. Apollo 11. All twelve latches
 are locked. CAPCOM Roger 11. This is Houston. Understand
 12 latches locked. PAO And that was Buzz Aldrin reporting that
 all 12 of the latches in the docking mechanism had locked. SC 11, Houston. Whenever you're possessed
 of  a free moment, we've got this Evasive Maneuver
 Pad. CAPCOM Okay. SC Go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11 ready to copy. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Evasive
 Maneuver, SPS G&N 63481 plus 095 minus 020. GTI is 004 40 01 00 plus 000 51 plus all balls
 plus 00190. ROLL is your option. PITCH 213 357. NOUN 44 is NA VT is 00 197 003 00152.
 The rest of the pad is NA. No ullage. LM weight 33290. Read back. Over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston, standing
 by for your read back. Over. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Do you read? Over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Do you
 read? Over. SC Alright. All of a sudden, we had a little
 click and the signal strength began to start dropping off. Your transmissions were cut
 off very abruptly. How do you read now? CAPCOM Roger. Loud and clear. We had a handover
 to Madrid about the time, I was I guess halfway through the pad. If you could give me the
 last value you read, I'll pick up there. Over. SC Okay. Start with VA. Over. CAPCOM Roger.  VZ is plus 00190. ROLL your
 option. PITCH 213 357 and NOUN 44 is NA � VT is 00 197 003 00152. The rest of the pad is

 Out. PAO This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 4 minutes.
 Apollo's velocity now is 17, 014 feet per second. It's distance from Earth, 11,753
 nautical miles. We're about 5 minutes away from ejection of the lunar module and about
 35 minutes away from this evasive maneuver. The ignition on the evasive maneuver an elapsed
 time of 4 hours 40 minutes 1 second. It will be a service propulsion system burn of 3 seconds
 duration, V 19.7 feet per second. SC Houston. Apollo 11. CAPCOM Go ahead 11. SC We'd like to arm our logic switches. CAPCOM Okay, go ahead with the logic. SC Okay, mark logic 1 and 2 armed. CAPCOM Roger. We show the logic armed and
 you're GO for pyro alarm. SC Houston, we're ready for LM ejection. CAPCOM Roger, you're go for LM ejection. SC Thank you. SC Houston, we are sep. We have a cryo press
 light. CAPCOM Roger, copy. Cryo press light. CAPCOM Roger, 11. We recommend that you turn
 the O2 fans on manually and insure that the O2 heaters are in the automatic position. SC Roger, O2 heaters are on and we're going
 to cycle the O2 fans now. CAPCOM Roger, O2 heaters to auto or you can
 watch them in the armed position and O2 fans manual on. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston, over. SC This is Apollo 11. CAPCOM Roger. In reference to your question
 on RCS usage, it looks like you are about 18, maybe 20 pounds below nominal at the present
 time. No problem at all. Over. SC Great. SC Wanted to be 18  20 pounds above nominal. CAPCOM Sorry about that. PAO This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 34 minutes.
 Apollo 11's velocity is 14,972 feet per second. Its distance from Earth is 15,895
 nautical miles. Spacecraft weight 96,760.9 pounds. We're about 5 minutes from the Evasive
 Maneuver  that one sure there will be no problems of re contact between the spacecraft
 and the S IV B stage of the launch vehicle. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Your systems are looking
 good. We're standing by for the burn. PAO The duration of this burn will be 3 seconds.
 Delta V 19.7 feet per second. PAO Ignition. Shut down. SC Houston, Apollo 11. Could you confirm that
 pitch gimbal motor turned off? We just shut all 4 off and we got a questionable indication
 on the ECS on PITCH 1. CAPCOM Roger. Stand by a second. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Stand by,
 please. SC Go ahead, Houston. Did you copy our residuals? CAPCOM Roger. We got 00 and .2 it looks like. SC We had .1 a while ago. It just went to
 .2. CAPCOM Okay. SC That EMS Delta-V counter is minus 4.0. CAPCOM Minus 4.0, roger. SC And how about pitch gimbal 1? Can you confirm
 that off? CAPCOM Can you stand by just a second on that?
 At the present time, we cannot confirm it off. We saw a current drop indicating that
 several gimbal motors had gone off. We'll be back with you in just a second on it, over. SC Okay. If necessary, we can recycle it. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. If you
 go ahead and cycle Pitch gimbal motor number 1 on and then off and give us a mark and we'll
 tell you what we see. Over. SC Okay, fine. It's coming back on, ready,
 mark. It's going back off, ready, mark. And that time we got an on board indication,
 Houston. Thank you a lot. CAPCOM Roger, we confirm that it is off. SC Yah, we do likewise. PAO This is Apollo Control at 4 hours 44 minutes.
 A news conference at the Kennedy Space Center is about to begin. We will take down the live
 circuits and tape air to ground during this news conference, play it back after the conference.
 This is Mission Control Houston. PAO This is Apollo Control at 5 hours 11 minutes
 into the mission. The S IV B slingshot maneuver was completed about 5 minutes ago, designed
 to put the third stage of the launch vehicle into a trajectory, will take it behind the
 trailing edge of the moon and then into a solar orbit. The crew did not witness this
 maneuver. The Command Module was not in the proper attitude where they could see the S
 IV B at the time. We've advised the crew that we do not believe we will do the first
 mid-course correction, that we'll wait for mid-course correction 2 tomorrow and expect
 a Delta-V to be performed in that maneuver of about 21.3 feet per second. We've also
 had some other brief transmissions including comments from Neil Armstrong on the view out
 the window and a weather report on a part of the world he can see. We have the tape
 of these transmissions that have occurred during the news conference at the Cape. We'll
 play that for you now and then catch up live. SC Houston, Apollo 11. We're starting our
 maneuver to observe the S IV B slingshot. CAPCOM Roger, 11. We've got an updated attitude
 for you on the slingshot operation. SC Okay, say the angle please. CAPCOM Roger, ROLL 002.5. PITCH 289.3. YAW
 357.5 and there's also an update, minor correction to your attitude for the P 52.
 Over. SC Roger, I have ROLL 2.5. PITCH 289.3 and
 YAW 357.5. Over. CAPCOM Roger, and for your P 52 and optics
 calibration it'll be ROLL 346.5. PITCH 345.0. YAW 0007.8, over. SC Roger, 346.5, 345.0 and 7.8. Thank you. CAPCOM Houston, roger, out. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. SC Roger, go ahead, Houston. Apollo 11. CAPCOM Roger, we're going to go ahead and
 enable the S IV B for the slingshot maneuver. The LOX dump will start about 12 minutes from
 now, over. SC Okay, LOX dump about, I guess that'll
 make it about 0.1 up. CAPCOM All right, I'll try to give you a
 little closer update as we approach it. SC All right. CAPCOM And 11, for your information, the magnitude
 of mid-course correction number 1, if we burned it, looks like about 17 feet per second. We're
 presently considering not burning it. This would make mid-course correction 2 tomorrow
 about 21.3, over. SC That sounds good to us. CAPCOM Roger, you're looking good now. SC We didn't have much time, Houston, to
 talk to about our views out the window when we were preparing for LM ejection but up to
 that time we had the entire northern part of the lighted hemisphere including North
 America, the North Atlantic and Europe and Northern Africa. We could see that the weather
 was good, just about everywhere. There was one cyclonic depression in Northern Canada
 and the Athabaska, probably east of Athabaska area. Greenland was clear and it appeared
 to be, we were seeing just the ice cap in Greenland. All North Atlantic was pretty good
 in Europe and Northern Africa seemed to be clear. Most of the United States was clear.
 There was a, looked like a front stretching from the center of the country up across north
 of the Great Lakes and into Newfoundland. CAPCOM Roger, we copy. SC And I don't know what I was looking at,
 but I sure did like it. CAPCOM Okay. I guess the view must be pretty
 good from up there. We show you just roughly somewhere around 19,000 miles out now. SC I didn't have much outside my window. CAPCOM We'll get you into PTC one of these
 days and take turns looking. SC Houston, Apollo 11. We're, we've completed
 our maneuver to observe the slingshot attitude but we don't see anything, no Earth and
 no S IV B. CAPCOM Roger, stand by. In GET I have a LOX
 dump start time for you. It's supposed to start at 5 plus 03 plus 07 and stop at 5 plus
 04 plus 55. LH burn starts at 5 plus 37 plus 47, stops at 5 plus 42 plus 7. Over. SC Roger, thank you. CAPCOM 11, Houston. SC Go ahead, Houston. CAPCOM Roger. We now recommend the following
 attitude. ROLL 307.0. PITCH 354.0. YAW 019.5 and the LOX dump has already been enabled
 so we can't hold it off any longer. SC That's okay. Go ahead. We'll maneuver
 around at 307, 354, and 19 ?. Thank you. CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM 11, Houston. It doesn't look to us
 like you'll be able to make it around to this observation attitude in two minutes.
 We recommend that you save the fuel. Over. SC Okay, Houston. We've, you got to us just
 a little late. Our maneuver's already begun so it's going to cost just about the same
 amount of fuel to stop it no matter where we stop it and we may as well keep going. CAPCOM Roger, go ahead. CAPCOM 11, Houston, LOX dump initiated. SC Roger. We still don't have the  CAPCOM Roger, out. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston, over. SC Go ahead. CAPCOM Roger, if you'll give us ACCEPT and
 stay in POO, we'll set your trunnion bias to 0 and I have a plan for balancing your
 oxygen cryos, over. SC You got it. CAPCOM Roger. SC Houston, Apollo 11. We've got what appears
 to be the S IV B in sight only it has to be a couple of miles away. It's at our number
 5 window and the dump appears to be coming out of two radially opposite directions from
 the S IV B. CAPCOM Roger. They're continuing with the
 non-propulsive vent from the liquid oxygen tank. It would be radially opposite then.
 And boosters tell me, tells me it's the continuous vents system, they're also dumping
 a small amount of fuel at this time. You got about 23 ? minutes or so until the APS burn.
 Over. SC Roger. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We have a recommended
 configuration for your cryo switches to even up the load between oxygen tanks 1 and 2.
 Over. SC Okay. CAPCOM You're coming in very weakly there.
 We're recommending O2 tank 1 heater OFF, O2 tank 2 heater to AUTO, O2 tank 1 and 2
 fans both OFF. H1, H2 tank 1 heaters to AUTO and H2 tank 2 heaters to OFF. Over. SC Rog, we have that except the last one was
 H2 fans to OFF. Is that affirmed? SC The configuration we have now is hydrogen
 heaters, we got 1 AUTO, 2 OFF, oxygen heaters 1 OFF, 2 AUTO and we have all the fans off. CAPCOM This is Houston. Roger, we concur.
 Out. CAPCOM 11, this is Houston. We've completed
 the trunnion zero bias setting. You can retrieve the computer and go to BLOCK. SC Roger, I thank you. CAPCOM 11, this is Houston. We're just maneuvering
 to view the slingshot. I guess we missed copying LM CM Delta P reading. Over. SC Stand by, we'll give you a recent one.
 Right now reading 0.2, Bruce. CAPCOM Roger, 0.2. CAPCOM Okay, Mike, and could you verify that
 your waste compartment valve is in VENT then? SC Roger, waste compartment valve has been
 in VENT for, oh, 45 minutes or so. CAPCOM Roger, we copy. SC If we're late in answering, it's because
 we're munching sandwiches. CAPCOM Roger, I wish I could do the same here. SC Don't leave the console. CAPCOM Don't worry. I won't. SC Frank doesn't like it. How is Frank today? CAPCOM Oh, he's doing quite well. PAO This is Apollo Control at 5 hours 22 minutes.
 We're back live now. The Delta-P you heard discussed is the difference in pressure between
 the LM and the Command Module, cabin pressure. Apollo 11 coming up on 22,000 miles distance
 from the Earth now. Velocity 12, 914 feet per second. 1"

Landing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6R3j1NU2nQM,-1,469303,2577,410,2694,6R3j1NU2nQM,"I'm Andrew Chaikin author of a man on the moon the voyages of the Apollo astronauts by July 1969 NASA was racing to meet President Kennedy's audacious 1961 challenge to land a man on the moon and return him safely to the earth by the end of the decade Apollo 11 might just be the mission that transformed the moon from a light in the sky into a place where humans had actually walked for its history-making crew commander Neil Armstrong command module pilot Mike Collins and lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin this was the ultimate test flight but by far the most complex and difficult part was the lunar landing itself Armstrong had privately concluded that they had about a 90% chance of getting home safely but only a 50% chance of a successful landing on the afternoon of July 20th 1969 Armstrong and Aldrin stood side-by-side at the controls of their lunar module eagle 50,000 feet above the moon they ignited their descent engine and started down toward the surface almost immediately there were problems that might abort the mission first it was trouble with communications with earth then repeated alarm signaled that the onboard computer was becoming overloaded with too many tasks and might stop working by the time Mission Control solved these problems eagle was less than a thousand feet above the moon but with all the distractions Armstrong had missed seeing the landmarks he'd memorized now he looked out his window and saw that the computer was steering them toward a crater the size of a football stadium surrounded by boulders some as big as cars this was not the place he wanted to try to make history's first lunar landing Armstrong decided to take partial control from the computer to adjust eagle's flight path and rate of descent the lunar module was actually easier to fly than he had expected but he knew he only had enough fuel for one try at a landing he steered past the big crater and flew onward searching for a landing spot finally he saw a place that looked good with just a hundred feet to go Armstrong brought Eagle down for the final descent his hunt for a new landing spot had eaten into their fuel supply and that fuel was getting lower by the second and now he had a new problem the blast from the descent rocket was kicking up lunar dust sending it rushing out in all directions in a fast-moving haze that obscured his view while Aldrin read out the diminishing altitude Armstrong guided Eagle lower struggling to keep from drifting sideways or backwards lest they risk tipping over a touchdown now came an ominous warning from Earth just 60 seconds of fuel left before they would be forced to abort now only 30 seconds finally a blue light on the instrument panel signaled that one of three metal probes attached to Eagles Landing legs had touched the moon Eagle settled gently onto the surface that Armstrong shut down the descent rocket in Houston it was 3:17 p.m. Armstrong broadcast a message of triumph to Mission Control person fan Goldie base here the eagle has landed rocket wing tranquility we copy on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue we're breathing again thanks a lot this incredible moment belong not just to the crew of Apollo 11 but the four hundred thousand people who had worked tirelessly for nearly a decade to make this momentous achievement possible the Apollo teams had turned a science fiction dream into reality humans were on the moon almost seven hours after landing with 600 million people around the world watching and listening Armstrong emerged from eagle's front hatch sealed in his pressurized spacesuit he descended the ladder on the front landing leg stood in the foil covered foot pad placed his left boot on to the ancient dust of the moon and spoke for the ages upon all fair plan I'm by Amanda Armstrong spent his first minutes on the surface of another world getting used to the moons one-sixth gravity taking pictures and collecting a first priceless sample of lunar dust and rocks then it was Buzz Aldrin's turn beautiful view it happen I never fried out huh except isn't definitely Aldrin recently talked about what it was like to stand on the surface of the Moon nothing prepared me for the starkness of the terrain it was barren and rolling and the horizon was much closer than I was used to I even felt a bit disoriented because of the nearness of the horizon on earth we have no awareness of its curvature and it's easy to understand why people used to think that it was flat but on the moon which is only one-quarter the size of the earth I had the visual impression that we were standing on the knoll of a huge gentle hill that extended all the way to the horizon and was neatly rounded off I could actually sense that Neil and I were standing on the sphere I was particularly struck by the contrast between the starkness of the shadows and the desert like fairness of the rest of the surface it ranged from dusty gray to light tan and it was unchanging except for one startling sight our lunar module with its black silver and bright orange yellow thermal coating shining brightly and the otherwise colorless landscape the color of the ground depended on the angle of the Sun it could be shades of gray or it could be quite bright if the Sun was at my back if I looked around my own shadow the surface gave off a whitish color but if I look toward the Sun it appeared as dark as charcoal high overhead almost straight up I could see the earth a beckoning oasis shining far away in the black sky but it was hard for me to look up that high because of the stiffness of our spacesuits I also couldn't look directly at the Sun it was too brilliant almost like a floodlight of pure white light the amount of light that reflected off the lunar surface was so high It was as if we were standing in brightly lit snow the sky was utter blackness I could see no planets or stars as planned I jogged around a bit to test my manoeuvrability in the moons one-sixth gravity it felt almost like floating and I had both feet in the air most of the time as I ran it looked like fun and it was but it was also exhausting my strongest memory of those few hours on the lunar surface was a constant worry that we'd never accomplished all the experiments we were scheduled to do there wasn't time to savor the moment I do remember that one realization wafted through my mind when I was up there I noted that here were two guys farther away from anything that two guys had ever been before and yet at the same time I was very conscious that everything we did was being closely scrutinized from almost a quarter of a million miles away the rest of the two-and-a-half hour moonwalk was a blur of activity Armstrong and Aldrin planted the United States flag and took a phone call from President Richard Nixon Aldrin tested different methods of running on the moon Armstrong collected rock samples the two explorers set up a pair of scientific experiments including a seismometer to detect moon quakes Armstrong took an unplanned run back to an 80 foot diameter crater about 200 feet from the lunar module where he took photographs Aldrin hammered metal tube into the ground to extract a core sample of lunar dust and the men left behind a small packet containing a memorial to the crew of Apollo one who died in a flash fire inside their spacecraft during a pre-flight test along with a silicon disk containing messages from leaders of 73 nations and a small gold pin representing an olive branch a symbol of the peaceful nature of Apollo 11 then all too quickly it was time to climb back into Eagle for a meal and a night's rest meanwhile in lunar orbit alone in the command module Columbia Mike Collins was sweating out the real moment of truth of Apollo 11 liftoff from the moon Armstrong and Aldrin would fire the single engine of Eagles ascent stage to leave the surface and rendezvous with him in lunar orbit if that engine didn't work his crewmates would die on the moon and Collins would have to return to earth alone the next day as the world held its breath Aldrin counted down the final seconds to the critical moment all right eight seven six our work page is in our method for speed beautiful 26:36 pizzas back it up perfect cover Eagle soared into space heading for lunar orbit less than four hours later Collins saw his crewmates returning and he knew they had really done it when the astronauts splashed down on July 24th NASA had accomplished a giant leap for mankind for

common",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnYvYvofGUc,0,8827,441,10,212,RnYvYvofGUc,"he was fifty years ago 1969 that Magna pan was founded by Jim whiny maker of extraordinary planner magnetic speakers but 69 think about it 69 what else happened in 1969 landing on the moon oh and Woodstock I mean a lot more but let's those three things it's kind of an amazing coincidence that landing on the moon Woodstock and magnet pan all happened I think basically in the summer of 69 but this is really a celebration of Magna pan I came to magnify and laid in 2008 I reviewed the 1.6 QR and it was talked about a game-changer it was a huge huge game-changer for me and I've since been a more or less continuous fan of Magna pants up to the recent my recent rave review of the LRS which is a 650 dollar full range ribbon speaker made in the USA made in White Bear Lake where all Magne pans have been made since 1969 well since 1971 when they started actually making speakers but it's an incredible company Jim winey was a former 3m engineer and he basically took a piece of mylar attach some basically metallic ribbon aluminum ribbons to it and I have a picture that I'm showing right now and the first magnet pan was born I was at the factory and I saw that and it really was like wow this is this is where it all happened that's that's pretty cool I watched them make speakers there and making a magnet pan is a is a lot of handwork actually there's very little it's done by machines and and watching these skilled technicians building the magnet pans was was really extraordinary but you know the first one the first name a pan that blew everybody away and longed for I was thinking about the the the timpani the original magma pan tympani which kind of looked like I'm going to show it right now sort of a room divider a three panel panel speaker and it went on through many iterations but the basic idea remained the same to have this boxless speaker that wasn't an electrostatic speaker electrostatic speaker is a fundamentally different thing in lecture static speakers charge stater with a diaphragm between them that you plug into the wall to charge the stators there are no magnets involved in an electrostatic speaker a planner magnetic speaker has doesn't get plugged into the wall it is just a thin diaphragm with magnets behind it and some kind of voice coil or ribbon attached to that diaphragm no plugging into the awesome collection sax player the wall magnum hands don't so people confuse them I'm not sure why but they're both panel speakers that's what they have in common so so that the timpani is chugging along and it's big and I won't fit in a lot of rooms so in 1980 or 82 I can't get the date exactly straight but the SMG was was born the small Magna pan and was inexpensive and sold by the boat loads or truckloads and was made it easier for people to fit magnet pans in rooms Jim whiny just kept coming up with ideas he he did this in the late 70s a unit pivot owner on the unit track so for $325 he saw ten a thousand of them which is a huge number what are your file standards but I guess it was a dead end because there wasn't another magnet pantone arm or a turntable or anything else just that one-shot thing but it had an impact apparently it sold 10,000 of them but they came a lot of things but the the the ribbing transitioning from planner magnetic worse basically that mylar diaphragm with wires attached to it to the a mylar diaphragm where a thin very very thin I was amazed when I was at the factory how thin the ribbon is it's so thin that when they drop a piece of it in your hand you can't eat with your eyes closed and they drop it in your head you can't even tell anything at your hand it's that light really hard to work with theythey I said hey Steve wanted to try applying this to the diaphragm was like total and fisted death wasn't gonna happen but I watched technicians do it and it was pretty extraordinary so then they have some full range ribbon speakers like the LRS and the 1.7 but there are the higher end magnet pans like the 3 Series the 3 6 the 3 7 20 and now the 30 have true ribbon tree tweeters true true ribbon tweeters and those tweeters are just a an aluminum ribbon and no substrate to us you could blow on it and just moves and there are magnets around it and that ribbon and even the ribbons that are quasi ribbon they're not like a ribbon tweeter that you see on many many many speakers where it's 2 inches tall the ribbon in a in a 3.6 or 3.7 is 4 feet tall it's very skinny maybe like a half an inch wide but it's 4 feet tall and that's a whole different way to produce high frequencies with a true ribbon as Maggie Pan defines it meanwhile I'm certain contrast to the way most ribbons are heard and speakers were it say according to magnet pants peak a quasi ribbon where the ribbon metal part the aluminum metal part is adhered to to some substrate like mylar or something else so it's therefore heavier and not as quick but this is really a celebration of magnet pans 50th that's quite an achievement and without ever veering off course I'm making them in other countries to save money or making super duper models and that's one of the things that always struck me about Magna pan in contrast to other audiophile companies is they resisted that temptation to make like a reference version you know the ultimate like this the 3.6 and then there's the 3.6 reference or the 3.6 signature version where it has better capacitors and silver wire and a stiffer frame they never they never did that they just said here's the model we're making now and enjoy if you want to change the crossover change what be my guest but the basic thing is what we had conceived and there's no real need to upgrade it do you want to knock yourself out so you know one of their cool little side projects was this planner magnetic woofer the DWM which is a tiny you know like not very big woofer and it's used with the MMG or presumably now the LRS and integrating it not the simplest thing in the world but when it's when it's all clicking it's pretty damn impressive the you know of a new 30.7 their flagship is very ambitious speaker the previous flagship the 20.7 has been around in various forms for a while but then there's Jim whiny as the founder the cup for the original engineer his son Mark Laney is running it now but then there's the other guy at magnet pan and his name is Wendell tiller and Wendell is the marketing director and has been there since I think 74 or something / so he's he's pointing to put in some time and the guys passion and drive is irrepressible I talked to my group I've talked to my took to win magna ban and Wendell they kind of blend it'd be the same thing I talked to Wendell from time to time and our conversations are far ranging about audio about speakers about the everything and it's incredible I always have an amazing time talking to Wendell so thanks Wendell for being there and staying staying driven passionate not you haven't lost a thing you know I could go on but you can tell I am truly excited and I want to wish everyone at magna pan great success to another 50 years of making incredible speakers in White Bear Lake Minnesota if you guys out there you magma pan owners out there unaware that it's 50 years please I just want to say join the anniversary wishes chime in below in the comments section if you are a magnet pen curious you can direct order some of them from the company like the LRS which is in backward a situation right now Chris it's such an incredible speaker for $650 a pair but eventually I'm sure the support the supplies will open up but you can dip your toe into Magna pan tech for not a lot of money and I think that

moonlanding,"On December 7, 1972, NASA launched Apollo 17, a lunar mission crewed by Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and Harrison Schmitt. It would be the last time humans traveled beyond low Earth orbit, the last time man landed on another celestial body, and the last time man went to the moon. The Last Steps uses rare, heart-pounding footage and audio to retrace the record-setting mission. A film by Todd Douglas Miller.

This is a Great Big Film -- one of our tales of pioneers, dreamers, and innovators so extraordinary, we had to go deeper to connect to the full scope of the story. Come with us to the cutting edge of achievement.

 challenged the nation to land someone on the Moon before the end of the decade. America had barely just started sending people
 to space at all. But just eight years later -- and 47 years
 ago, today -- Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin walked on the Moon, on the Apollo 11
 mission. They were the first humans to ever set foot
 on another world. Apollo 11 launched on July 16, 1969, at 9:32
 AM local time from -- appropriately enough -- Cape Kennedy, Florida. Armstrong, Aldrin, and a third astronaut,
 Michael Collins, were on board. To get all the way to the Moon, they were
 perched in a small capsule atop the Saturn V, the most powerful rocket in history. Fully loaded with fuel, the Saturn V was over
 a hundred meters tall and weighed almost three million kilograms -- that’s 15 times as
 much as a blue whale. The rocket worked in three stages: The first stage burned eight hundred thousand
 liters of a fuel called RP-1, a type of kerosene that’s used in rockets. It ran out of the RP-1 in the upper atmosphere,
 where the first stage detached and fell into the Atlantic Ocean below. This made way for a second stage that burned
 through a million liters of liquid hydrogen. The second stage ran out of fuel at the edge
 of space, which is when the third and final stage took over, burning even more liquid
 hydrogen. It kept burning until the ship was high enough
 and going fast enough to orbit the Earth. Then, the engines were turned off -- but they
 still had some fuel left to burn. After a couple of hours, the crew aimed at
 the Moon and turned the rockets back on. Two days later, they became the third crew
 in history to orbit the Moon, and their mission was still just beginning. Armstrong and Aldrin crawled into the Lunar
 Module and started drifting down towards the surface, while Michael Collins stayed in lunar
 orbit. Until now, things had gone pretty smoothly. The rockets fired like they were supposed
 to, and Apollo 11 seemed to be following the path that NASA scientists had mapped out. But no one had tried to land on the lunar
 surface before, and that’s when they started to run into some problems. For one thing, the Lunar Module’s computers
 almost fried themselves. But the computer was also aiming the ship
 at rocks. They were supposed to land in the middle of
 the Sea of Tranquility, which is a big, flat basin on the Moon’s surface. But early in the descent, Armstrong and Aldrin
 noticed that they were passing landmarks about three seconds earlier than they were supposed
 to. Three seconds might not sound like that big
 of a deal, but it meant that they were going to land a few kilometers away from where they’d
 originally planned. And as they got closer, Armstrong noticed
 that they were headed right for a field of boulders. If they hit one of those boulders, that would
 be the end of the mission -- and maybe even their lives. With only about 30 seconds’ worth of fuel
 left to spare, Armstrong switched control of the craft over to a semi-manual mode and
 piloted it to safety. And that was it: The first humans in history
 had landed on the Moon. According to the official schedule, they were
 supposed to follow the landing with a few hours of rest before getting ready to open
 the door. But they were a little too excited to sleep. I mean, who wouldn’t be? They were on the
 MOON! So the schedule was switched around a bit
 and they immediately started preparing to go outside. And so, on July 20, 1969, at 10:56 PM on the
 east coast of the United States, an estimated six hundred million people worldwide -- a
 fifth of the world’s population at the time -- watched Neil Armstrong become the first
 person to set foot on the Moon. With Buzz Aldrin following closely behind
 him. Little known to most of that immense audience,
 though, NASA wasn’t positive that the astronauts would get back off the Moon. If it took more fuel than planned, or if something
 went wrong or broke on the way up, they would be stranded there. And there was no rescue
 plan. This was a likely enough possibility that
 speechwriter William Safire was asked to write a speech for then-president Richard Nixon
 to read in case the worst happened. And something did break while they were on
 the Moon’s surface. When he was getting back into the cramped
 lunar module, Aldrin accidentally broke a knob off of a circuit breaker that was responsible
 for arming the main engine. Luckily, he and Armstrong realized that they
 could fix the problem by sticking a felt-tipped pen where the knob went. They safely rejoined Michael Collins in orbit
 and headed home. Eight days, three hours, eighteen minutes,
 and thirty-five seconds after leaving Earth, Apollo 11 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean. At the time, scientists didn’t actually
 know if there was any life on the Moon, so the entire crew was quarantined for almost
 a month, just in case they brought back anything dangerous. Then, finally, they were released, and went
 back to living life like the rest of us -- if the rest of us were huge international celebrities. Thanks for watching this episode of SciShow

moonlanding,"The moon landing was a feat of engineering, accomplished through the careful deconstruction of a 3,000 ton spacecraft.

Apollo 11 launched on July 16, 1969, carrying Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins on a journey to pull off humankind’s first moon landing. The eight-day journey was made possible by the careful deconstruction of the Saturn V rocket and Apollo spacecraft, and made use of a technique of docking components of the spacecraft in lunar orbit so the astronauts could land on, and then launch from, the lunar surface.

 moments in human history. That’s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, walking
 on the moon. Okay, maybe you’ve seen this clip before,
 but think about that for a second: They’re on the moon. A celestial object nearly 240,000 miles into
 outer space. That distance is like flying all the way around
 the Earth 9 1/2 times. Millions of people around the world watched
 on July 16, 1969, as Apollo 11, carrying astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins
 launched from Cape Kennedy, Florida, and disappeared into the sky. It was the climax of years of preparation
 and research, and the pinnacle moment of the so-called “Space Race” between the United
 States and Soviet Union, a years-long rivalry to compete for dominance in space exploration. For the eight days following the launch, the
 world awaited the return of the would-be heroes. So what actually happened between here and here? So let’s start with the components of the
 ship that were discarded one by one until this became this. Here’s the rocket that sent the astronauts
 into space: the Saturn V. The three stages of the Saturn V each played
 a different role in launching Apollo on a path to the moon — we’ll get to that later. On top of the rocket is the actual Apollo
 spacecraft. It’s made up of three parts too. There’s the lunar module, the component
 that would eventually land on the lunar surface, the service module, which had propulsion systems
 for course corrections and entering and escaping orbit, and the command module, where our three
 heroes were for most of the mission. And last but not least, this is the launch
 escape system, which was designed to pull the command module away from the rocket if
 something went wrong during launch. Together, all these pieces made up the Saturn
 V rocket and Apollo 11 spacecraft. But it’s the way they came apart that made
 the moon landing happen. The Saturn V’s first stage launched Apollo,
 carrying the spacecraft 42 miles above the Earth and reaching a speed of about 6,000
 miles per hour. The first stage then detached, and once the
 Saturn V’s second stage kicked in, the now needless launch escape system jettisoned too. The second stage propelled the spacecraft
 even farther and faster into space, and after it detached, the third stage of the rocket
 fired briefly to knock Apollo into a parking orbit, 103 miles above the Earth’s surface. Here, final checks were made, and the Saturn
 V fired again to set Apollo on course to the moon, in a move called the “translunar injection.” Once the spacecraft propelled away from Earth,
 the Saturn V’s job was done. Now the astronauts needed to pull off a mid-flight
 maneuver to reconfigure the ship so the crew could access the lunar module, which had been
 stored in a protective compartment during launch. To do this, the command and service modules
 detached together and flipped 180 degrees, docking with the lunar module and extracting
 it. In the process, they ditched the third, now-useless,
 stage of the Saturn rocket. This whole high-stakes launch process only
 took about 3 1/2 hours and this — the completed Apollo spacecraft — was the end result. For the next three days, Apollo coasted through
 space. Until it finally reached its target and was
 pulled into orbit by the moon’s gravity. This is where the crew split up. Armstrong and Aldrin transferred to the lunar
 module, named Eagle, and slowly descended toward the surface. While Collins continued to circle the moon
 in the command module, called Columbia. Now here comes another tricky part: landing
 on the moon. To make this historic moment happen, Eagle
 turned and used its engine to slow its momentum and ultimately touch down on the lunar surface. “The Eagle has landed.” The moonwalk was broadcast live on television,
 immortalizing Neil Armstrong’s words here: “That’s one small step for man, one giant
 leap for mankind.” “I think that was Neil’s quote I didn’t
 understand.” “‘One small step for man,’ but I didn’t
 get the second phrase …” After about 21 1/2 hours on the moon, Eagle
 performed the first launch from a celestial body that wasn’t Earth, leaving its landing
 gear behind and timing its ascent with Columbia’s path in lunar orbit to rejoin the spacecraft. Once Armstrong and Aldrin transferred back
 into the command module, the lunar module was no longer needed. Just like before, Apollo needed to break out
 of orbit. This maneuver is called the transearth injection,
 and began the 2 1/2 day journey home. Upon approaching its entry point into Earth’s
 atmosphere and no longer needing its propulsion engines, Apollo jettisoned the service module
 and prepared for reentry, protected by the now-exposed heat shield on the bottom of the
 command module. “Apollo blazes across the heavens, coming
 back to Earth at 25,000 miles per hour.” Parachutes deployed, and Columbia splashed
 down safely into the Pacific Ocean. And what was once a 3,000-ton behemoth of
 rocket, fuel, and freight was reduced to this. A small command module floating in the ocean,
 carrying three astronauts and rock samples collected from the surface of the moon."

more",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOlsCY9VvJ4,0,3719,54,3,43,OOlsCY9VvJ4,we have practiced was part of the commitment of Charlie great so every day just challenging people are here in the facility and just know I have to want another it's great for the spirits defensive presence recently specifically though because we're second we were second of our street well yeah I think you know it's just resulted in mostly possibly so I think that in terms the little things that we can clean up rebounding being in the right spot I think those are little things that we can give better at just to like a team from getting easy points I've spoken about it the less sometimes with those teams just get a leak outs and transitioned back cuts just easy plays we can stop most of their plays have Pro please everyone has a great feel of you know what system teams are running so for us we we have a very very versatile team so a lot of switching a lot of you know common systemic stuff that we had to limit team from getting the paint and when we do that then you know we're pretty successful you get some for playing every other day for the next 36 days just how do you approach that from a physical standpoint the sugar do everything you can do everything you can you know you wanna prepare yourself the best you do the best way you know how and that includes doing extra stuff if need be but it's more or less about maintenance and survival at this point so a lot of games and short amount of time you know glad that most of our games they're home soap and it was great to recover a year but you know it's just survival that's all there's be talk about maintenance carry seizing my off days even if I don't come in a gym or they're dedicated to about you know five or six hours a day I just think it's just drinking a couple reworking or anything I can just you know so I have a great team around me as well as the training stuff here so anything that I can do to to get that edge to make sure that I'm fresh thinking about things I do now compared it to even a year ago um you know my off days are no longer off days they're just really dedicated to making sure that I'm committed you know it's it's an everyday job being a leader being a great professional working at your craft is everyday job is well worth know so you know I think it back in the back of my head is you know when I'm out there on the game I don't want to be the guy that you know people looking at if you run down six or seven times it gets tired you know that's six or seven time most guys are you know they don't want to get back on defense they don't want to sit this frame they don't want to do little things again and for me I just try to put that in the back of my mind when I'm working out like this is what I'm pushing forward and obviously you know working towards embassies for a guy like down in soon with an issue right now how important is it for him to take it slow this point is very important it's difficult to go through injury and season how hard is players to deal with injuries in a season you have specific roles that you want to play that the team has for you you were playing well your team could be playing bad your team misses you or something like that and it puts a mental strain on you because you obviously want to come back and be the player and play the game that you love to do so you know it's a test but he's a veteran he's been through it I just wanted to take his time really preach it to patients it's only December it is the same of it that came like Saturdays he is pressing against Detroit well I think M in Rob Williams probably you know big roll to the rim around that area where we kind of need over in present yeah and also having that veteran leadership of knowing when to top and we got a lot of young guys on our team figuring out the game of basketball is very high so reading reactants definitely something we work on every single day one on one what does it do for you going up against a guy like Marcus even scarier it's great it's great it just keeps my spirits high because now I know that when I leave my house in the morning I know exactly what I'm getting myself into you know with Terry tussle Marcus you know going to each date with some length and for me I've seeing so many different bodies on defense you know guys that are bigger guys that are faster anything like that so I try to utilize these guys and corn against them using their energy and then it's a pretty seamless going into the game tomorrow he was challenged masses decided to reach out to you guys saying things athletes saying things about life thinking that's the outside of basketball is any subdued if you challenge that or believe that you guys are just job through cuz you obviously went through the same thing and your thinker you consider yourself a hooker outside we don't consider you guys thinkers are they have insulted how do you take I hate that it has to be a subject of something like that we're talking science started within our art classroom certain things and get older and start coming into things that you have questions about it's natural to do that as an adult as a kid or anything like that I mean you know sometimes I feel like even myself you can speak ahead of yourself whether or not you know you could end up getting caught because now you're on this false platform of the thing where you know you you you're not even a human being you're now extrapolated for all the information that you know and think and now you have to fit a mold of something that you're clearly not more than just about slippers listen to Lupin in me you know subject you to being just that and it's a long affair at times obviously you know we're not as educated as in terms of schooling in terms of knowledge of learning school so these universities everyone you know 4-year degree in marketing or business or history or anything like that so I think probably that misjudgment is you know this more to this natural you know everyone feels like they have a place in this in this world to kind of question anything or question somebody so look at what social media nowadays like is anything on Twitter but one thing you know someone says would a check next to their name it's the biggest thing going you know so nothing's really original it's just history repeating yourself all over again which had people on history say some some things that they believed and they've stuck with no entire lives you know whether they'd be prominent individual society or not so you know I try to not pay attention to that mold at all I try not pay attention to whether it's salting or not I live my life based on biases or judgments though I base it on thinking or judging someone else for what they believe in as well so you know it's there it's society knows where we live in America where people say all the time about one like it's mean that kids see it like everyone gets a piece of it and that's the next story the next thing that's coming out of his mouth there's world hunger going on there like political things going on there are so many higher things in a totem pole of society that matter to human beings but hey Steph Curry says that you believe in the moon it's the thing all over it's on CNN they say we're just jocks who's athletes but it's on your channel so you know and I mean like we're that but you don't want us to be that so whoever you people think don't want to be educated don't want to seek knowledge no I think it's it's basically what the NBA has been in professional sports it's gonna hug it's it's been generated by media it's been generated by athletes has been generated by the fans we're all in collaboration with one another trying to grow a business we're all trying to put money in our pockets we're all trying to make sure that we all look great and what we're writing and what we're doing maybe sure we're doing the best we can I support that aspect of it anything that comes with it in terms of everyone's emotions in dealing with human being stuff in every single day and then come into work and doing those things I'm supportive for that as well as long as it doesn't spill in disrespecting anyone else people are blatantly disrespectful now like to people's faces and it's like ridiculous like to treat another human being like that so you know and people do it behind the screen people do on their phones every single day and I think that it's something to learn anything to how to treat with respect other people so you know whether or not he believes it or not NASA anything conspiracy anything history anything like that like I I come here to talk to you guys about basketball if you asked me questions about things that matter about life and I'll gladly answer those as well but I'm fully supportive for just loving human being that's it would you like to have a private life away from basketball you never bother that exists how do you manage in the market like this I mean it's such an intense market for sports you walk down the street someone knows you're it's easy normal you know go eat food do know things I mean but I think for me I've dedicated myself to an even higher level I have before my career look I'm trying to accomplish with my teammates in the organization so anything that goes outside of that I'm I don't want to deal with so my free activities are really dedicated to watching film making sure I'm doing everything I can to prepare my body in my mind making sure anything I do to gain more knowledge on how to be a better leader man yeah all my day not a drone fire well thank you very much

I The Hangout,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRy-dlhUUh0,0,206,3,2,2,lRy-dlhUUh0,all right your boy Steph Curry set the internet ablaze with his troll game by pretending she did not believe that the United States of America is NASA the space program ever reached the moon why is that people confuse with the other NASA anyways my question is who had the better troll game of recent is the better troll Steph Curry and the moon or Kyrie Irving and the earth which troll ranks higher for you we'll start with nits I mean how are we ranked ngosource stupid oh you know what better troll Steph Vanessa free trip to NASA no they wouldn't Irene yeah you got a lot of flack yeah I got a lot of work so yeah yes Steph wins this one I think I restarted more conversations right do you feel so about a lot of people came out of the Woodworks like is the earth flat conversations were happy people started coming out and saying actually but remember this is a guy who shot himself out the cannon and you had to be hospitalized yeah hear about this yeah guy after Steph every after Kyrie came out with his claim I do shot himself out of a cannon the proof of the earth was flat it's real how does that prove this flat I don't know there's a math do it with all these trolls the question I have for you guys is do you think NBA players should be conscious of what they say on these podcasts when they go out there just because of the amount of children that are paying attention even if it's a joke it wasn't clarified and people start questioning these things do you think they should start to consider that it's just fun and games you should actually yeah you have a platform you know that you have a platform you know who your audience is it's these kids that are totally impressionable but I think we made too big a deal out of him saying that the moon landing was faked so the air is more so with the media giving these pot these these little pot shots on podcast credibility than it is with the guys going out there and saying erroneous things Randy I think comes great power comes great responsibility and you have to be away the things that you're saying now I didn't hear him say it and if I did and it clearly sounds like he's joking then there's a definite problem with the media and how things are portrayed because you can say anything you want in a joking way and if you're not if you don't know that it's like you should be able to tell it's a joke and if you can't yeah you didn't do a good job then yeah then maybe he needs to be a little bit better but to sit there and just like let it go on and on and on because you think the media's stupid for playing it the way it is I mean I don't I don't know why Steph would he was silently protesting he let it go from maybe less than 20 that's like four scandals in the state's a pretty quick news cycle quickly on the Dwyane Wade farewell tour was rolling along the only person who seemed to notice was LeBron James because he made a big stink about it but um we've seen farewell tours before how come no one's making big noise out of Dwyane Wade did he overstay his welcome and that's why we're not as excited as egos not as big as your boy Kobe Bryant over there that's what people are celebrating Dwyane Wade spinals I think Dwyane Wade is just like a little bit more of a workman like guy that just came in was awesome won a couple of championships everyone sort of respected and be over States welcomed to I think is welcome he's once again maybe a little bit because I think when he when you go from a couple different team before your last year then it kind of yeah hurts your farewell yeah if he was on the one team like Miami is some Chicago Cleveland and it gets kind of different then okay alright well that's my farewell for this segment but we still got one more segment to go here at Cadiz home for talking hoops this is the hangouts and damn man the Phoenix Suns they they're not very good but guess who is Trevor Ariza then I'm excited to see where he goes next well it's a sour plate this looks like a sour plane Jesus crying oh my goodness that is the epitome of Phoenix basketball right there Four Winds right now
moonlanding,"Neanderthals are our closest relatives and their extinction 40,000 years left us as the last remaining member of the genus Homo. 

Misconceptions about them, however, have continued to prosper since their demise, and I hope that this video succeeds in lessening the impacts of such negative misconceptions.

Misconceptions,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCK4GRSNhpg,0,417464,8629,621,1995,MCK4GRSNhpg,"Neanderthals were our closest relatives and have a fascinating history that we are only just now beginning to uncover however ever since an initial discovery in the mid 19th century the species has been surrounded by numerous misconceptions which in some cases have completely warped the perception of our closest relatives into a negative and more primitive light and this is something that is not true in the slightest the under thoughts were just as fascinating as us and in this video I want to clear up some misconceptions that some of you may or may not still believe hope you enjoy this is one misconception that for most of us in the scientific community is very obviously not true but for people who don't quite grasp how evolution works I'll explain it to you Neanderthals weren't the ancestors of us Homo sapiens but instead our species evolved alongside that the under thor's with both of our species splicing off from Homo erectus around three hundred and fifty thousand years ago the evolution of us and the under Thals is not just a linear path which strives towards a predetermined goal evolution is more than that evolution is more along the lines of a tree with branches springing out from a base with some branches falling off and some continuing to grow and diversify each branch carrying with it its unique story and adaptations the march of progress the image you'll see all the time when looking at images of human evolution falls into this category of a linear and oversimplified view into evolution this image was based off of the theory of Auto genetic evolution where scientific minds of the time believe that organisms have an innate tendency to evolve in one definite direction with each newly evolved organism becoming gradually more advanced as time progresses this thinking however is completely flawed as I mentioned prior life in the past was just as advanced and as complex as our modern world and to assume that all these long dead organisms are inferior to us is just plain wrong evolution is much more complex in this image would lead you to believe and it is something that needs to be out of focus for us as a species to grasp what evolution truly is as Stephen Gould once said life is a copiously branching Bush continually pruned by the Grim Reaper of extinction not a ladder of predictable progress one prevalent myth about Neanderthals and their life appearance is that Neanderthals would have had to have possessed thick hair to survive in their freezing northern habitats but this is certainly far from the truth despite Neanderthals being on average stronger and stockier than modern humans they more than likely didn't possess vast amounts of hair as commonly thought large amounts of integumentary thing required for living in a colder climate by looking at modern animals that live in colder climates today or even during the time of the Neanderthals like mammoths possessed thicker levels of fat compared to other elephant species something that alongside with their thick hair allow them to survive all across Eurasia during the Pleistocene Neanderthals on the other hand due to their close relation to humans as well as a complete lack of evidence more than likely did not possess such fat levels with the recent evidence it is evident that Neanderthals wore simple cape like clothing whilst archaic humans that arrived into Europe or more complex styles of clothing with stitching and needles likely already being in place by the time our ancestors arrived in Europe and whilst modern humans had more sophisticated clothes and tools Neanderthals were not dumb brutes because of this more on that later and there is no reason to believe that they were less sophisticated than us simply by which method their clothing was created by not to mention if Neanderthals really did have large amounts of hair this excess hair would have resulted in an overproduction of sweat which in the cold conditions of Pleistocene Europe would have frozen on the on the Y and earth ores potentially leading to the death of an individual this is one misconception that is among the most widespread when it comes to Neanderthal life reconstructions in the early days of Neanderthal discovery the then prevalent notion of Neanderthals being brutish hunched over eight men was reinforced with the discovery of a Neanderthal specimen which was given the name la chapelle orc Saints one or as it is simply known the old man which seemed to further reinforce the preconceived thoughts of early anthropologists the specimen was in band health and such the initial reconstruction of the specimen was that of an individual with a thrust forward skull a spine without curvature as well as bent hips and a divergent big toe this find being among the best preserved in the under Thals of the time heavily influenced the now a common interpretation of Neanderthals being primitive creatures but there was a problem though discoverers anj boy Sony and Elle Barden were completely wrong in how they hypothesize Neanderthals to look the old man was fittingly old being an estimated forty years old at the time of his death the equivalent to an 80 year old in terms of a modern equivalent he was in bad health with the Neanderthal having lost most if not all of his teeth as well as suffering from an advanced case of arthritis this is what made the old man hunched over and this bad posture was figured out later in 1957 to be advanced arthritis unbeknownst to bowl the discoverer of the specimen with the relatively fragmentary nature of the fossil likely being the cause of bowls errors unfortunately this image of hunched over Neanderthals has continued to this day in pop culture depictions and is likely to remain that way for some time this misconception is arguably the most widespread when it comes to Neanderthals and that is not Neanderthals were brutish unfeeling sub humans that were unintelligent and thus inferior to us however this is most definitely not the case Neanderthals were not the brutish animals they have been portrayed as throughout the years quite the contrary in fact from the vast amount of evidence we have found of Neanderthal remains it is evident that Neanderthals not only cared for their old and sick but also possessed cognitive abilities that were remarkably similar to our own there is in fact evidence to suggest that Neanderthals were not unfeeling towards their own kind and that they treated each other with the same level of compassion that we trees her own families then the under thought specimen known as Shanna Diwan otherwise known as Nandi by his discoverers showed that he was not exactly in the best of conditions by the time of his death Nandi was between forty through fifty years at the time of his death making him remarkably old for his kind but he didn't reach this age easily at an unknown time in his life Nandi had suffered a violent blow to the left side of his head which whilst it is unknown how this strike was inflicted this blow created a crushing fracture to Nanda's left orbit likely leaving him completely blind in his left eye not to mention analysis has revealed that Nandi likely suffered from profound hearing loss as his left ear canal was partially blocked and his right ear canal was completely blocked by bone growth essentially forming bone over his right ear canal which would have been exceptionally painful for him in life he also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in numerous places losing him the use of his lower arm and hand this is sought to either be congenital a result of childhood diseases or even from an amputation at some point later in life this injury would have likely caused paralysis down the right side of his body which would have led to eventual deformities in his lower legs and foot which would have left him with a pronounced painful limp but even with all these terrible injuries and deformities that would have made his life a misery Nandi lass is surprisingly long for an individual with such pronounced physical defects and this is all jus from the underfill companionship for all the evidence we have accumulated all of Anandi's injuries were acquired long before his death showing extensive healing in damaged areas Nandi is the prime case for the under fools looking after their sick and aged showing that Neanderthals clearly expressed group concern when it came to their weaker members Nandi isn't even the only Neanderthal at this site or in the entire archaeological record who despised both trauma and healing and it goes to show that Neanderthal compassion was a clearly widespread across their species and that nandi's case was most definitely not just a one-time thing us only this evidence has piled up that Neanderthals also had an affinity for the arts that which includes cave painting a study published earlier in 2018 revealed that cave paintings from three different sites in Spain were not only made sixty-four thousand years ago but that Neanderthals must have certainly created them not only are these currently the oldest paintings ever found in the world their date of creation predates the arrival of modern humans in Europe by at least 20,000 years highly suggesting that the under thor's made this selection of art the cave art itself comprises of mainly red and black paintings that includes representations of animals geometric shapes and handprints alongside many others this goes to show that the under Thor's possessed a much deeper and sophisticated culture than we could have ever imagined prior and it gives us a hint in two times long past the grunting sounds that are now associated with our relatives are most definitely a case of our Mis judgment on how we view our cousin's yonder Thals like us most definitely had some form of language and while still being unknown to us they could definitely engage in complex conversation and come up with plants just like we do today it was long believed that Neanderthal simply liked the necessary cognitive capacity and vocal Hardware for speech and language rendering them incapable of little more than a series of grunts recent studies however through three-dimensional x-rays of a Neanderthal hyoid bone have revealed that Neanderthals possessed a hyoid bone that was practically identical to that of us Homo sapiens meaning that language and complex communication was not implausible at all for them hypotheses about how they might have sat in life become more prevalent over the years and now assists of Neanderthal throats revealed that their throats were more squats than ours and with the dimensions of a Neanderthals chest and skull taken into account it is fair to conclude that the other Thor's would have made very interesting high-pitched sounds and while unusual would not exactly be too alien to us while this theory is yet to be solely proven as of yet the study of how Neanderthals may have sounded is continually fascinating to this very day all said and done the menagerie of misconceptions based around the under Thor's are well and truly false and their existence continues to plague the modern view of our close cousins in an unfair light and that is something that needs to be fixed and restored if we as a species are to truly appreciate the under Thor's for what they really are you"

#ChangE4 #ChinaMoonLanding #UltimaThule",China's Chang'e-4 lands on moon as NASA releases Ultima Thule pics | DW News,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deAjOFW5kgg,0,108374,733,82,712,deAjOFW5kgg,a chinese spacecraft has made the first successful landing ever on the far side of the moon and this is what it looks like this image was sent by the probe chang e4 which made what chinese officials described as a soft landing early this morning the probe is equipped with a rover and measuring devices and is also carrying seeds for an experiment in cultivating vegetables in a closed environment on the lunar surface the mission is seen as an important step as china develops its space program well for more now let's bring in keith cowing he's a former rocket scientist and editor of the blog nasa watch thanks for being with us this morning first of all what made it so difficult to land a probe on the far side of the moon it's never been done before no it hasn't and we've done it many times on the near side of the moon because we can have direct radio contact with that because we can see that side of the moon but on the far side is blocked from direct radio contact with the earth so china had to put a relay satellite around the moon so that he could see the earth so the spacecraft could talk to the satellite and the satellite would then talk to earth so it adds an extra layer of complexity okay so it's a bit complicated but why is it scientifically significant what do we learn from all this well first of all the landing location is very interesting it's in von carmen crater which is inside a larger crater called the aiken basin which is a monstrous crater that's bigger than any crater on anything in our solar system and it was so deep that when it happened parts of the original lunar crust may have been brought up so that's where the probe landed and it'll be the first time anybody's landed there to take a look at it scientifically so that's the most important thing now china did not offer a live broadcast of this event it uh only announced it once it was done why the secrecy you know i was actually on cgtn about two hours before it landed everybody assumed it was going to happen you know i don't know uh maybe they just wanted to make sure they got it right or you know i i don't know but as soon as they knew that they'd done it they uh i said so and even the nasa administrator tweeted a congratulation to them a minute later so uh once they did it they told everybody okay uh now china lands on the far side of the moon here we've got india about to launch its second moon mission why are these developing powers investing so heavily in their space capabilities you know that's a question i actually ask a lot because here in the states we say yeah yeah we did that 50 years ago and why are these other countries doing it now and i guess what are they learning that we've forgotten i mean it was a matter of national pride for us back in the 60s and now this sort just sort of seems to be the gold standard for being an advanced technological nation china has done it uh japan has sent uh probes to the orbit the moon israel is about to land a commercial lander on the moon so as they said in the 60s you know the everyone's going back to the moon apparently that song is going to be a hit again okay keith thank you so much that was keith cowan there uh an editor of the blog nasa watch well america's space agency has also achieved a space exploration milestone this one billions of kilometers from the sun nasa's new horizons probe sent the first detailed images of the space rock ultimateula the pictures show what what it looks what looks like a giant snowman nasa has described it as an entirely new kind of world the frozen rock at the edge of our solar system is the most distant object ever explored by humankind
moonlanding,"Stephen A. Smith and Max Kellerman try to grasp why Warriors star Steph Curry would feed into the conspiracy theory that astronauts never landed on the moon when he is such a major role model.

Take,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN_3FfznXLE,-1,399703,3647,2365,7894,lN_3FfznXLE,one small step for man excuse me let me just read this off here and one giant lie for mankind Steph Curry telling the ringers winging it podcasts that he doesn't believe we ever landed on the moon Nassau has since offered to show proof of the moon landing in 1969 to the two-time NBA MVP curry addressed all of the reaction to the comments saying this I've got a lot of interesting feedback from some X NASA astronauts that I'm planning on having a conversation with curry telling not to reporters according to the athletic so some good is going to come out of this for sure max yep talk to me I don't think this is funny actually like we can laugh at it but I don't think it's funny Steph Curry has College three years of college Steph Curry's a role model kids look up to Steph Curry probably more than any other NBA player they relate to him he's not so big he's not the fastest he's just as talented and works hard and his great teammate and I could be like that they really love Steph and he's a role model as a result of that and that's just it responsible like to feed into those kind of like when Kyrie Irving said he thought the earth was flat I mean that's the dumbest thing a public figure has said in my lifetime it is one of them but Steph Curry not believing in the moon landing it's not like that but it's in the same vein it's like here's the issue with how much information we have access to now because of the internet it's great we have access to information but how do you vet the information how can you tell the high quality information from the low quality information the reason foreign governments can interfere in our politics is because way too many people have moved away from fact-based you know evidence and toward nonsense and conspiracy theories and so they're easily manipulated is a crisis in the words we populism is on the rise in the world partly it's because of the access to information without the ability to vet it so when a role model like Steph Curry I know it seems like I'm making too big a deal out of it it does says something as monumentally stupid as he thinks we never landed on the moon kids are watching that they're listening to that it's a scary indication of where we are and and in I don't think it's funny I really don't think it's funny well it's not a matter of it being funny I think that you're missing the point here you're not wrong in terms of you know the facts of it all fifty years ago it happened I believe it happened you believe it happened of course we believe it happened okay no no the reason why I put it that way is because you refused to appreciate the fact that in our society there are people no matter how many facts you point in their face you know they don't believe it because they think you talk about you know high quality information and the matter in which you gathered that information there are people Max Kellerman that are standing right in front of your face and and will tell you in the face of fact hell no and it happens because they don't trust anything that is associated with our government what our nation's would various nations throughout this world now there are people who think like that just like we said but you don't like NASA said you know not only have we been on the moon okay and we got hundreds of pounds of rocks to show it to show that we were on the moon we plan on going back and this time we're gonna be in a position to ultimately stay these are the kind of things that they're saying what did Steph Curry allude to nope don't believe that either now in the age of technology and us not seeing how advanced our society has become of course you feel differently max of course I feel differently but there are people out there who attack conspiracy theories to everything and I don't want to get into the details in terms of what they've been suspicious about in terms of things that have happened in our nation it's unfortunate but it's a reality that's inescapable people do that all the time and I think it's at that particular moment in time that we we harken back to what Charles Barkley said when he said that he's not a Roma I am NOT a role model he should not have said that and I don't ever think that he meant it literally what he's saying is that the obligation and the onus ultimately falls on your parents and what happened because you know you got to know who not to listen to my situation I am NOT claiming that what you're saying isn't true that there are people who their nature is contrary and they they're extremely suspicious and it's good to be cynical about things that's not problem the problem is the rejection of facts when a public figure rejects facts on the basis of of like drivel on the internet or some friend whispering in their ear about some government conspiracy with zero actual research with any high quality information right when that is uttered publicly it is incumbent upon the Fourth Estate you and I to castigate to say that is it not mince words death that is a stupid comment don't say it again go read a book an actual book I learned that that's that that that's what we have to do that that's fair I'm not I'm not I'm not gonna refute what you're saying there I'm simply saying that are you really meaning a Steph or somebody else yeah are you really questioning the facts per se because you just don't believe it are you questioning the veracity of individuals or organisations who may come forward I'm saying that's fine there are people who feel that way I am glad that it's high real death and others have curious and cynical minds that's part of like the scientific process in fact but when you then reject facts and go on your own wishful thinking and wide-eyed conspiracy theories that is it's detrimental to society when you are in a public position and you oughta it just being hope so yeah well the other thing the other thing about it is this what will be being unfair to Steph Curry in this particular situation you're on a podcast and somebody makes some flippin comment and you asked what you believe it it's not like he researched it and said these are the facts and I'm ignoring them you said in other words he just sweetie or I guess that was a tweet that we showed what he's talking about he spoken to some folks from NASA they've reached out to him and now he's going to become more informed about it and then you don't express himself then I'm just saying him making a flippant comment and being suspicious about something I don't think it warrants that reactions is a def saying that's cool I really do sources available to him in a well - doesn't matter what you care about he is as embattled internationally he's obviously bright he went about about what you can't have not think we didn't land on the moon he might just be go so I hope
moonlanding,"Stephen Curry gives high praise to the Sacramento Kings for battling back to push the Golden State Warriors to a 130-125 win. Steph Curry says the Kings' moon landing video during lineup announcements caught him off guard as he gives Sacramento an ""A for effort."" Stephen Curry says the Kings are moving in the right direction and ""have to feel good about their future.""

Bopp how did that's me against attentively this it's tough but in Challenger we played with great energy and purpose in first half there's a lot of possessions the pace is crazy so the numbers look inflated but professor we can play us now the first half 3rd quarter ruff and obviously beginning a fourth was our over six minutes Wow at the last four minutes in unity we got a lot of stops a lot of deflections rebound the ball well and that gave us enough possession to go back in the game getting out to the second last possession where you need to stop and we go down you think of the video pregame of but I caught me off guard that was no son hey bruh with that many whistles blowing a lot of them offensive files it's hard to get a flow or rhythm with that kind of stopping the topics warn ya and Wade you know they were making shots and second half takes office I don't know what happened lot of illegal screens I'm assuming all six of them more clear offensive this happens like that sometimes versus this is tough trying to combat their runs have good officer positions you know him get shot when you plan a guy like the Aaron who put so much pressure on your defense is it fun to get caught up in that back and forth because you know he wants to go slack off at all transition so over the course of 48 he's gonna make some tough shots he's gonna get by you a couple of times just because he's always got his foot on the gas pedal honestly like that's advice like three or four possessions he day he took three pull-ups and two shanlee short and he made one of them cuz he's a great player you just got to take the go to bed and just keep on anything in the direction now finish that statement very good shape there guys seem to figured out a style of play that fits their skill says it's a great coach where's the stuff and they made that jump though I think I feel good about what there the future plans that they have got a playoff team you kind of go so English last weapons in the first rodeo like and town streets for self believe you're making key plays noted stretch what do you notice about each other's furniture situations confidency and each other I can force the issue possession of a place for us I had a couple good looks and then go down and then you see the confidence and the trust inside transition I make a backdoor cut clay spots up in the way engage us and thinking trust me get a sweet scent knock her down you don't know how it's gonna happen every possession every day an attendant goes out tight games with like my chances the saxophone trust each other and that's the biggest thing together so continent
moonlanding,Audio highlights from the seventh day of the Apollo 11 mission.,Apollo 11 Mission Audio - Day 7,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6MAVU9EkMWE,0,6400,62,3,3,6MAVU9EkMWE,"…okay, entry conditions which is, would
 primarily be for corridor control, controlling the flight path angle at entry. And the current
 predicted splash time in the Pacific is 195 hours 17 minutes 25 seconds. At the present
 time Apollo 11 is 172,654 nautical miles from the Earth, traveling at a speed of 4017 feet
 per second. We estimate that the spacecraft will be half way home at a ground elapse time
 of 159 hours 53 minutes 43 seconds. At that point 
 the spacecraft will 145,583 nautical miles
 from the Earth's surface, and we will have completed half of the return trip measured
 from lunar orbit insertion to splashdown. Now we also have another figure that would
 be for the time of which the spacecraft velocity is equal with respect to both the Earth and
 the moon. At that point the velocity will be 4300 feet per second with respect to both
 bodies and we would define this as the equal potential point and that will occur at 155
 hours 30 minutes and at that time the spacecraft will 156,874 nautical miles from the Earth,
 52 543 nautical miles from the moon. We're now 1 hour 28 minutes 26 seconds from ignition
 for the midcourse correction 5 maneuver. Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over. Roger, go ahead Houston. CAPCOM Roger, if Neil has a free minute, we've
 got a question or two regarding the C02 partial pressure and water in the suit loop discrepancy
 noted yesterday. Over. Go ahead. Roger, 11. Was water noted in both suits or
 only in yours, Neil? SC I think only in my suit. CAPCOM Okay, can you locate that occurrence
 for us in time when you first noticed water in the suit either by mission time or relation
 to any particular event? SC I think it was after insertion sometime,
 Bruce. I don't remember exactly when. It was when we were in orbit and had our, after we
 took our helmets off. CAPCOM Roger, did you call it co us when you
 first noticed it, or was it sometime after when you called us? SC It just might have been probably 20 minutes
 after I noticed it that I mentioned it to you. CAPCOM Roger. Was this noticing the water
 accompanied by your erratic C02 partial pressure readings or was that a separate problem? Over. SC Well, the water problem evidenced itself
 before we noted any erratic motion the PCO2 gauge. CAPCOM Roger. What was the relative sequence
 on selecting water separator number 2 and the secondary CO2 canister - that is, did
 you go to the secondary water separator first and then the secondary CO2? Over. SC I believe we went to secondary C02 first. CAPCOM Roger, we copy. Was there any change
 in your suit loop count?. SC Now… CAPCOM Go ahead. SC I should mention, Bruce, that when I went
 to water secondary, water separator to secondary that. I didn't notice any change, but about
 after 15 minutes or 20 minutes the water stopped coming out. So,
 maybe that was just water that was already in the loop that was still blowing out, but
 the secondary water separator was operating properly. CAPCOM. Roger, did you make any changes in
 the suit tube configuration after you went from the egress mode to the cabin mode after
 insertion - that is, in particular, they're interested in knowing if you recall changing
 the diverter valve position to egress any time while you were on the secondary canister?
 Over. SC No, I don't believe we did that at all,
 Bruce. CAPCOM Okay, 11. Thank you. That sums up our
 questions for now and we'll crank these back into the engineering pipeline and see what
 we can come up with. SC Okay. Are you satisfied that the CO2 circuit
 breaker was in (garbled)? Over. CAPCOM Say again, please. SC Roger. In LM jettison, are you satisfied
 that the C02 circuit breaker was in? Over. CAPCOM Yes, it was in. SC Roger, could you confirm that? I thought
 there was some question after we got into the command module as to whether that had
 been left in or not. Over. CAPCOM Roger, 11. It was in and confirmed
 in, and the readings after jettison say about .I to .2. PAO This is Apollo Control at 149 hours, 41
 minutes. We're now about 49 minutes away from the first midcourse correction of this transearth
 leg of the Apollo 11 flight. That maneuver will be a 4.8 foot per
 second burn of the spacecraft reaction control system thrusters and is scheduled to occur
 at a ground elapsed time of 150 hours, 29 minutes 54 seconds. At this time Apollo 11
 is 171,017 nautical miles from the earth and the spacecraft velocity is 4043 feet per second. Houston, Apollo 11. Over. 11, this is Houston. Over. SC Roger. I wonder if you have noticed any
 change in the biomed returns sign you're getting? Over. CAPCOM Negative, Buzz. Still looks kind of
 bad. Apparently when you move around, it's cutting in and out. Have you checked the little
 electrical connector where it goes into the signal conditioner? Over. SC I did. They're all about as tight as can
 be. I tell you what I'll, I'll take them out and put them back on again to see if that
 makes any difference. CAPCOM Okay, if you would at your convenience.
 We'll be watching it down here. PAO This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 4
 minutes. Telemetry data at this time shows the spacecraft in the proper attitude for
 the upcoming midcourse correction maneuver. The crew will soon be verifying their attitude
 by taking a sighting on a star through the sextant and then be running some tests on
 the guidance and control system and the reaction control system before the maneuver takes place.
 That burn now scheduled to come a little over 25 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 170 102 nautical
 miles from the Earth and the spacecraft velocity is 4058 feet per second. Apollo 11, this is Houston. We'd like you
 to try acquisition on the high gain antenna for us at PITCH minus 90, YAW 270. Over. SC Roger. Got us some work. CAPCOM Roger, out. CAPCOM 11, this is Houston. We're showing
 about 6.8 percent on waste water on our telemetry now. Over. SC Okay, we've got about 9 up here. Over.
 CAPCOM Roger, out. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We're standing by for
 your burn. Everything's looking good from down here. SC Thank you Bruce. You've got about a minute
 and 20 seconds. CAPCOM Roger, we concur. PAO One minute until midcourse correction
 number 5. It will be a 10.9 second burn of the spacecraft reaction control system thrusters
 giving a change of velocity retrograde of 4.8 feet per second. The primary purpose of
 this maneuver will be to control the spacecraft flight path angle at entry interphase. We're
 now less that 30 seconds from the initiation of the burn. PAO They should be burning at this time. PAO And we show the burn off. SC Houston, do you copy our residuals? CAPCOM Roger, we've got your residual fuel
 count reading for us. SC DELTA VC is plus .2. CAPCOM Roger. Plus .2. SC It was actually plus 100.2. Okay? CAPCOM Okay. PAO That midcourse correction was performed
 at a distance of about 169,000 nautical miles from the Earth at a spacecraft velocity of
 4075.6 feet per second. PAO This is Apollo Control at 150 hours 35
 minutes. Our telemetry data here on the ground shows that a midcourse correction maneuver,
 just about nominal, burn duration 10.5 seconds. Prior to the maneuver, we were predicting
 a splashdown time of 195 hours 17 minutes 25 seconds. And we expect there will be some
 modification to that after we've had a chance to do some tracking following this midcourse
 correction maneuver. Apollo 11 is now 168,843 nautical miles from the earth traveling at
 a speed of 4078 feet per second and we're continuing to see a very slow buildup in the
 velocity. SC Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM Go ahead, 11. SC Roger. We're in FTC attitude and would
 you please give us a call when our thruster activity has subsided sufficiently? CAPCOM Roger, stand by. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. We're going
 to hand over from Madrid to Goldstone at 151 hours even. If you should lose lock on the
 high gain at this time, you may require at PITCH minus 45 yaw 270. Break. We're still
 watching your rates. Over. SC Okay. Thank you. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston, over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston, over. SC Go ahead, Houston. CAPCOM 11, we're still seeing rates on your
 spacecraft above those we would like for and the continuation of the PTC mode which we
 are still monitoring it and we'll advise you when it has settled down, over. SC Okay. PAO This is Apollo Control at 151 hours 11
 minutes. The crew is presently setting up the spacecraft for passive thermal control.
 Once it stabilizes out it will begin a slow roll rate of three revolutions per hour to
 maintain temperature control. At the present time Apollo 11 is 167,448 nautical miles from
 the Earth and the velocity is 4101 feet per second. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. You are
 Go for the set up on PTC, over. SC Thank you. SC Houston, Apollo 11, over. CAPCOM Go ahead 11. SC It didn't like it that time. When I got
 down to the entry 27303 enter, it took off in roll at a high rate in excess of one degree
 per second. Over. That stopped it now and we are going to have to go back and do it
 over again. I’d like to try find out the reason it did that. CAPCOM Roger. You might as well start setting
 up for it and we will be working the problem here. SC Okay. You do have us on high bit rate here
 now? CAPCOM That's affirmative. SC Okay, good. I'll maneuver back to PTC Ignition
 Attitude while you guys look at the data and see what you think. CAPCOM Roger. SC Houston, Apollo 11. I think the reason
 is in having 1620 on the DSKY during the subsequent entry or at least that’s one possibility. CAPCOM Roger. We’ll check it out. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. While you're
 waiting for the CSM to settle down and for us to look at the tapes on your latest maneuver,
 would you feel like answering some more questions with relation to the lunar surface? Over. SO Go ahead. SC Go ahead, Bruce. CAPCOM Roger. For 64,000 dollars we're still
 trying to work out the location of your landing site, Tranquility Base. We think it is located
 on LAM2 Chart at Julia .5 and 7.8. Do you still have those charts onboard? Over. SC Stand by one. They're packed. CAPCOM Roger. You may not have to unpack it.
 The position which I Just gave you is slightly west of Wess Crater. I guess it's about two
 tenths of a kilometer west of it and we were wondering if Neil or Buzz had observed
 any additional landmarks during descent lunar state or ascent which would confirm or disprove
 this. One thing we're wondering about is that if you were at this position, you would have
 seen the Cat's Paw, during the ascent just up to the
 north of your track. Over. SC We were looking for the Cat's Paw too,
 thinking we were probably downrange beyond the Big Z. But I think that it's likely that
 that might have been Wess Crater that we went across in landing, but, stand by. SC We're hoping, Bruce, that our 16 millimeter
 film was working at that point in descent and we'll be able to confirm our touchdown
 position. We thought that during ascent we might be able to pick up some recognizable
 objects close to the landing site, and we did see a number of small craters and crater
 rows and things like that, which we may be able to pick out after the fact, but we haven't
 been able to yet. CAPCOM Roger. And the next question from our
 panel is for Buzz. We recall that he reported seeing a laser upon AOS of the Earth the first
 time after, the first rev after ascent, and we're wondering what color the beam was and
 if he could determine at the approximate location with respect to the Earth. Over. SC It was mostly white, perhaps a tinge of
 yellowish color to it, and it seemed to be, as I recall it, the terminator of the Earth
 was toward the horizon and seemed to be about a quarter to a third of the way down from
 down toward the terminator of the Earth from the opposite horizon. That's a third to a
 quarter of the Earth's radii. Over. CAPCOM Roger, and that puts it in the light
 side? Over. SC Roger. Yes, it was in the light side. The
 Earth was about 2/3 lit, Earth, with the terminator down toward the horizon. And now, coming from
 the opposite LM of the Earth, the sunlight LM, coming down about one quarter to one third
 of a radius in from the LM. Generally, ESSENTIALLY located with respect to a line drawn perpendicular
 to the terminator that goes through the center. Over. CAPCOM Roger, Buzz; we copy. SC And I got pictures of that. I'm sure that
 will show up. SC And I saw, I saw that too. It was a very
 bright spot of light and I confirm Buzz's observation of its position. CAPCOM Okay, 11, very good. Now with respect
 to the documented sample container on television it appeared to us as though the samples for
 that container were in fact being, given, being selected in accordance with some thought
 or consideration being given to the rocks themselves, and we were wondering if you could
 give any further details from memory about any of these samples and the context of the
 material or the surface from which they were taken. Over. SC Yes, you remember I initially started on
 the side of the LM that the TV camera was on and I took a number of samples of rocks
 off the surface and several that were just subsurface and about 20, 15 to 20
 feet north of the LM. And then I recalled that that area had been probably swept pretty
 well by the exhaust of the descent engine, so I crossed over to the southern side of
 the LM and took a number of samples from the area around the elongate double crater that
 we commented on and several beyond that and tried to take as many different types, of
 rock types as I could see by eye as I could in the short time we had available. There
 were a number of other samples that I had seen earlier in our stroll around the LM that
 I had hoped to get back and pick up and put in the documented sample, but I didn't get
 those and I'll be able to comment in detail when we get in the debriefing session. CAPCOM Roger. Did you observe any small craters
 with conspicuously blocking rims? Over. SC Well, aside from the great big one that
 we went over, I guess there were none in our area. I took a stroll back, after putting
 up the PSEP and all. Buzz was starting to unpack the documented samples, took a stroll
 back to a crater behind us that was maybe seventy or eighty feet in diameter and fifteen
 or twenty feet deep and took some pictures of it. It had rocks in the bottom of pretty
 good size, considerably bigger than any that were out on the surface but there was no,
 we apparently at fifteen feet or so had not got below the regalus. We were essentially
 showing no bedrock, at least in the walls of the crater at that depth. Over. CAPCOM Roger. We copy. Okay, thank you, Neil.
 That about wraps up the questions we have on hand for now. SC Okay. SC My compliments to the chef. The food's
 outstanding. This cream of chicken soup, I give at least 3 spoons. CAPCOM Okay. Cream of chicken, 3 spoons. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over. SC Go ahead. CAPCOM 11. We e concur that having VERB 16
 NOUN 20 up on the DSKY may well have had some effect, on your PTC initiation. It looks like
 this would give, let the computer work with the knowledge of the axle, PDU angles. What
 we'd like you to do is do a CDU 0 which is VERB 4 O NOUN 20 ENTER and then start the
 PTC procedure again at step 2 with loading VERB 6922 desired attitude in the AUTO maneuver
 and all that. OVER. SC Okay. The only I don’t understand about
 that is why it took off at the rate it did. What rate should it had taken off at under
 that theory? CAPCOM Stand by a minute, Mike. CAPCOM 11, CMB, this is Houston. Over. SC Go ahead, Houston. CAPCOM Mike, over here on page 9-7 of your
 checklist where we're setting up PTC, there's been a note penciled in after wait 20 minutes
 for rate to damp. Do not monitor a VERB 16 NOUN 20. It turns out that the significance
 of that is that if you are monitoring 16 NOUN 20 then when you get down here in step 7,
 the second time you do a VERB 24 you've got to reload the NOUN 01 to make it VERB 24 and
 NOUN O1 ENTER before you load the three registers. Over. SC Roger that. I was just questioning the
 rate at which the maneuver would begin if that were not done. CAPCOM Roger. We're still working on computing
 the rates for you. PAO This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 9
 minutes. At this time, the crew is getting the spacecraft set up to reinitiate the passive
 thermal control. Apollo 11 currently 165,143 nautical miles from the earth and traveling
 at a speed of 4,142 feet per second. The flight plan has relatively few activities scheduled
 for now through the beginning of the crew sleep period tonight.
 We do have a television transmission scheduled. I believe, the time on that is a little after
 8:00 P.M. Central Daylight Time. And we show the sleep period to begin at about
 160 hours Ground Elapsed Time or a little less than 8 hours from now. We'll continue
 to stand by for any conversation with the crew. It has been relatively quiet for
 a good part of today. We'll stand by for a call from the CAPCOM or from the spacecraft
 down to the ground. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston
 broadcasting in the blind. If you read us attempt to acquire on OMNI antennas, attempt
 to acquire on OMNI antennas, if you read. This is Houston, out. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston
 broadcasting in the blind, do you read? Our contact position on an OMNI antenna, our contact
 position using an OMNI antenna. Over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston
 broadcasting in the blind. If you read attempt to contact using an OMNI antenna. This is
 Houston. Out. PAO This is Apollo Control at 152 hours 29
 minutes. In the process of reestablishing the passive thermal control with the spacecraft
 in a slow rotation, we have apparently lost high gain lock on and we expect that the crew
 will reacquire lock with the antenna once the passive thermal control is reestablished.
 At the present time Apollo 11 is 164 thousand 320 nautical miles from the earth and the
 velocity is up now to 4 thousand 156 feet per second. We'll continue to stand by here
 for reacquisition of the spacecraft, for reestablishment of high gain lock on. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston
 broadcasting in the blind. If you read us attempt to acquire on OMNI antennas, attempt
 to acquire on OMNI antennas, if you read. This is Houston, out. SC Hey, Goldstone CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. How do
 you read, over? SC Loud and clear, Bruce. CAPCOM Roger, what antenna are you using? SC Houston, Apollo 11 has gone into high gain.
 How do you read, over? CAPCOM Well, you are loud and clear on the
 high gain. SC So what's new? CAPCOM Oh, we were wondering what was new
 with you up there? SC Oh, very quiet. We're just sitting here
 letting the thruster firing damp down when they, Houston, let us know and we will start
 this PTC. CAPCOM Roger. SC Nice to sit here and watch the Earth getting
 larger and larger and the Moon smaller and smaller. CAPCOM Roger. We'll give you a call when your
 rates have damped down sufficiently and we are unable at the present time to predict
 what rate you should have seen at your last attempt in initiate PTC. We saw about 2 1/2
 degrees per second, over. SC Yah, I believe that. SC Buzz thinks we should have a PTC program
 built in the computer. He could very well be right. PAO This is Apollo Control at 153 hours, 7
 minutes. At the present time, we are changing shifts here in Mission Control. Flight Director
 Gene Kranz will be coming on to relieve Flight Director Clifford Charlesworth. The Capsule
 Communicator on this shift will be astronaut Charlie Duke. There will be a change of shift
 briefing in the news center, in the building 1 auditorium in about 10 minutes. At the present
 time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of 4,185 feet per second. The spacecraft is about
 162,700 nautical miles from the earth. During the change of shift briefing, we will take
 the circuit down, record any conversation that develops with the spacecraft and play
 it back following the change of shift briefing. At 153 hours, 9 minutes this is Apollo Control,
 Houston. PAO This is Apollo Control. 153 hours 49 minutes
 Ground Elasped Time. Apollo 11, homeward bound, is now 161,015 nautical miles out from Earth.
 Velocity now 4216 feet per second. Some 3 1/2 minutes of recorded air to ground transmissions
 have accumulated during the recent Change of Shift Press Conference here in Apollo News
 Center. Let's play that tape back now. SC Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM Go ahead, 11. SC Rog. I was just checking the radios and
 how is the thruster activity coming? CAPCOM 11, Houston. The radios are still in
 good shape and we are still waiting for your rates to decay. We got .03 degrees per second
 in pitch now. SC Okay. We're in no rush. This is a very
 pleasant attitude as a matter of fact, the sun is down in the LEB so it is not shining
 through the windows and heating the place up. We’ve got the Earth steady out window
 1. We have the moon steadily out window 3 and of course be are locked up on the high
 gain, so as long as the thermal people are happy, we are happy. CAPCOM Roger, we copy. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston, over. SC Go ahead, Houston. CAPCOM Okay, 11. We are about ready to start
 PTC. I’d like to give you some high gain antenna angles though. We would like to operate
 in the react mode and if you plan on spinning up in the positive or negative direction,
 over? SC We can do it either way. I had planned
 the positive. CAPCOM Okay, for positive the high gain antenna
 setting should be pitch plus 30, yaw 270, and in react, over. SC Understand. React pitch plus 30, yaw 270.
 Thank you. CAPCOM Roger, and if you would when you are
 making your DSKT entries to set up for PTC, go a little slower and we will try to follow
 each entry from down here. Over. SC Roger that. SC Houston, 11. PTC established. CAPCOM Roger, 11. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We observed that PTC is
 fairly well established here and we'll keep you posted on how it's going and your friendly
 white team commentator is taking over now. CAPCOM That was the green team. SC Correction, all your green team – correction
 green team. Excuse me. CAPCOM Roger, out. SC How could I forget! I used to be a green
 one. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Your white
 team is now on. We're standing by for an exciting evening of TV and a pre-sleep report, over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Are you sure you
 don't have anybody else in there with you? SC Houston, Apollo 11. Say again, please. CAPCOM We had some strange noises coming down
 on the downlink and it sounded like you had some friends up there. SC Where, where do the white team go during
 their off hours anyway? CAPCOM Say again. PAO This is Apollo Control. Still no explanation,
 the weird noises emanating from Apollo 11, if indeed it is from Apollo 11. And it's reported
 from network that it's being received on the downlink at two different stations in the
 Manned Space Flight Network. Perhaps it will all shake out later in the mission as to what
 these strange noises are. We'll come back up again as conversation is resumed with Apollo
 11 now 160,410 nautical miles out from Earth traveling at 4228 feet per second. At 154
 hours, 5 minutes ground elapsed time this is Apollo Control. PAO This is Apollo Control 154 hours, 53 minutes
 ground elapsed time. 40 hours, 9 minutes to entry. Apollo 11 homeward bound 158,378 nautical
 miles out from Earth. Velocity now 4267 feet per second. We have some 3 minutes of tape
 accumulated over the past half hour of minor conversations with the crew of Apollo 1t.
 We'll roll these tapes now. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Over. SC Roger. CAPCOM Roger. Would you, we've lost comm with
 you for about the last ten minutes. Would you verify that the S-band track switch is
 in REACQ? Over. SC Negative. It's not. The last time we broke
 lock, we went to AUTO and I left it there. Sorry. CAPCOM Roger. We'd like you to put it in REACQ
 then monitor in about two minutes we'll be coming up on the high gain, would you monitor
 the REACQ if it doesn't take, acquire manually? Over. SC Okay. Say again the angles you'd like? CAPCOM We'll try to switch it ourselves. Stand
 by on the angles. CAPCOM Buzz, it's Pitch plus 30 yaw 270. Over. SC Roger, I've got them, Capcom. Thank you. CAPCOM Hello Apollo I1, Houston. Would you
 please terminate battery charge now? Over. SC Roger. Terminating battery chargers. CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM Hello Apollo i1, Houston. Any special
 attitude you'd like us to look at for the TV? Over. SC I don't guess we have a requirement to
 (garbled). CAPCOM Roger. We have an attitude that we
 can get the Earth out of a window or the moon. We’re trying to look at, find that we can
 get both if that's what you'd like. Over. SC A 50 degree roll attitude would probably
 give us that, Joe. CAPCOM Roger. SC That's a good one because it puts the earth
 out window 1 and the moon out window 3 and puts the sun down the LEB so the lighting
 in here remains rather constant. CAPCOM Rog. Well, we'll just stop on the 50
 roll then and we'll give you the word when to do that. Over. SC Okay. PAO This is Apollo Control. That completes
 the accumulation of air to ground communications by means of tape recordings on the last half
 hour or so. It's quiet right now. No conversation going on between Spacecraft Communicator Charlie
 Duke and the crew of Apollo 11. And at 154 hours 57 minutes ground elapsed time this
 is Apollo Control. PAO This is Apollo Control, 155 hours, 27
 minutes ground elapsed time. Coming up now about 3 minutes away from tonight's television
 pass. It'll be through the 85-foot antenna at the Goldstone tracking station. The 210
 foot dish out there is tied up tracking one of the Mars fly-by missions. We have some
 20 seconds of tape accumulated. We’ll play that back and rejoin the conversation line. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We'll have high
 gain coverage about 155:30. At that time, you can turn on the TV if you desire and continue
 your roll around until you get 50 degrees roll. Over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We were going to
 give you the all-star game tonight, but it was rained out. Over. SC Sorry to hear that. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We're on the high gain.
 You can warm up the SM if you like. Over. PAO This is Apollo Control still standing
 by for the incoming television signal from Columbia. Still nothing but the color bar
 test pattern as of now. Continuing to stand by on air to ground and television
 links. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We see you coming
 up on 50 roll. How does that attitude look? Over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready for
 the TV. We're all configured. At your convenience. Over. PAO This is Apollo Control. While we're waiting
 for the television pictures to come in, we have in the control room here a vase full
 of long-stemmed red roses, the card saying, ""To one and all concerned. Job superbly done.
 From a moonstruck Canadian."" Continuing to stand by as we wait for the pictures to come
 from Columbia. Here they come. SC Houston, Apollo 11. Over. CAPCOM Roger. Go ahead, 11. Over. SC Are you picking up our TV signal? CAPCOM That's affirmative. We have it up on
 the eidophor now. The focus is a little bit out. We see the Earth in the center of the
 screen, still have a little white dot in the bottom of the camera apparently, and see
 some land masses in the center. At least, I guess that's what it is. It's very hazy
 at this time on our eidophor. Over. SC Let me change, believe that's where we
 just came from. CAPCOM It is, huh? Well, I'm really looking
 at the bad, at a bad screen here. Stand by one. Hey, you're right. SC It's not bad enough (garbled). CAPCOM What? SC I said it's not bad enough about finding
 the right landing spot. We weren’t looking at the right planet. CAPCOM I'll never live that one down. SC We're making it get smaller and smaller
 here to make sure that it really is the one leaving. CAPCOM That's enough, you guys. CAPCOM Eleven, that was a good picture there. SC Okay, that's enough of the moon. SC Okay, that's enough of the moon, Charlie.
 We're getting set up for some inside pictures. CAPCOM Right. SC We've know there’s a lot of scientists
 from a number of countries standing by to see the lunar samples and we thought you'd
 be interested in seeing that they really are here. These two boxes are the sample return
 containers. They're vacuum packed containers that were closed in a vacuum on the lunar
 surface, sealed and then brought inside the LM and then put inside these fiberglass bags,
 zippered and resealed around the outside, and placed in these receptacles in the side
 of the command module. These are the two boxes and as soon as we get onto the ship I'm sure
 these boxes will immediately be transferred and delivery started to the Lunar Receiving
 Laboratory. These boxes include the samples of the various types of rock. The ground mass
 is the soil, the sand and silt and the particle collector for the solar wind experiment and
 the core tubes that took depth samples of the lunar surface. CAPCOM Roger. Neil, thank you much for that
 description. We've got a pretty dark picture down here could you set your F-stop? We'd
 like to have it, see if you can open it up a little bit, over. SC Okay, our monitor showed that to be very
 bright. SC We're down between, well, around F4 which
 we thought would be plenty right. We’ll lighten it up some more. CAPCOM Well, we'd appreciate it. It's pretty
 dark on all our monitors here. SC Okay, fine. CAPCOM That's looking a lot better now, Neil. CAPCOM There's Buzz. CAPCOM 11 Houston, we have an excellent picture
 now, over. SC Okay, how do you read me, Charlie? CAPCOM 5 by now, Buzz, over. SC Okay. The more mundane affairs, now that
 we've touched the moon, I'd like to trace through a little bit for you the developments
 that have taken place in the food department. I'm sure you've already seen this type of
 a drink container. A little later Mike will show you how the water gun operates with its
 new filter to take out the hydrogen. Essentially this water gun is put in this hand and filled
 up this bag with water and the drink then dissolves in the water and this end of the
 out feeding. Likewise we have other foods that are more solid nature. You can probably
 see this shrimp cocktail meal, this afternoon, while the two of us had salmon salad. Another
 early development was the use of bite size food. CAPCOM Eleven, Houston, Buzz, you're breaking
 up badly, will you check your vox, over. SC Roger, how am I coming through now, Charlie? CAPCOM You're very clear when you come through.
 It's just that your vox is not keying at every word, over. SC Okay. These bite size objects were designed
 to remove the problem of having so many crumbs floating around in the cabin so they designed
 a particular size that would be able to go into the mouth all at once. I think since
 all of our experience we've discovered that we can progress a good bit further than that
 back to some of the type meals that we have on Earth. As a matter of fact on this flight
 we've carried along pieces of bread and along with the bread we have a ham spread and I'll
 show you, I hope, how easy it is to spread some ham, while I'm in zero g. I think we've
 discovered that it is quite easy to…you're all very
 familiar with. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We notice your
 roil rate increasing. Will you please see if you can bring that down to about 04 so
 we'll be losing a high gain shortly? Over, SC You can also use zero gravity to demonstrate
 many things that we've all learned in school. I'd like to demonstrate briefly how easy it
 is to explain the action of the gyroscope. If I spin this can we know
 that according to the equations of motion that we would expect that it, once this is
 given a spin about, and has a spin axis in this direction, if we give it a particular
 torque, and if, I'll do this by pushing my hand against
 it in this fashion once its spinning, by the equations we can predict, that if I put this
 torque on it, it will in fact rotate this direction. Let's see how well this works out.
 See if I apply the torque this way, its rotated this way. SC Too close, I think? CAPCOM 11, Houston. It's a pretty good demonstration. SC Houston this next is a little demonstration
 for the kids at home, all kids everywhere for that matter. I was going to show you how
 you drink water out of a spoon but I'm afraid I fill the spoon too full and if I'm not careful,
 I'm going to spill water right over the sides. Can you, can you see the water slopping around
 on the top of the spoon, kids? CAPCOM That's affirmative, 11. SC Okay, well as I said, I was going to tell
 you but I'm afraid I filled it too far and its going to spill over the sides. I'll tell
 you what. I'll just, I just turn this one over and give me the water and start all over
 again. Okay? CAPCOM Okay. SC And you can see, up here we don't know
 where over is. One up is as good as another and that really is water, I tell you. SC That's really not the way we drink. We
 really have a water gun which I'll show you. Here's the water gun. This cylindrical thing
 on the end of it is a filter with several membranes. One allows water to pass but not
 any gas; the other allows gas to pass but not any water so by routing the gaseous water,
 which comes from our tank, through the filter we're able to drink purified water without
 the gas in it, filtered water. And of course all we do to get it started is just pull the
 trigger. It's sort of massy. I haven't been at this very long. It's the same system that
 the Spaniards used to drink at a wine stand at the bull fights, only I think it'd be more
 fun. SC We'll be seeing you, kids. CAPCOM Thank you from all us kids in the world
 here in the MOCR, who can't tell the Earth from the moon. SC Roger. Stand by one and we'll get you that
 (garbled). CAPCOM Looks like you need a wine skin up
 there, Mike. SC That’d be nice. SC Okay. 11, Houston. You have a picture now,
 Houston? CAPCOM That's affirmative. I refuse to bite
 on this one though. You tell us. SC Okay. This should be getting larger and
 if it is the place we're coming up to. CAPCOM Roger. SC No matter where you travel, it's always
 nice to get home. CAPCOM We concur 11. We'll be happy to have
 you back."

moonlanding,"Scientists have been reconstructing the history of the moon by scouring its surface, mapping its mountains and craters, and probing its interior. What are they learning about our own planet's beginnings?

Decades ago, we sent astronauts to the moon as a symbol of confidence in the face of the great cold war struggle. Landing on the moon was a giant leap for mankind. But it's what the astronauts picked up from the lunar surface that may turn out to be Apollo's greatest legacy.
 
When the astronauts of Apollo stepped out of their landing craft, they entered a world draped in fine sticky dust, strewn with rocks, and pocked with craters.  They walked and rambled about, picking up rocks that they packed for the return flight. 

Back in earth-bound labs, scientists went to work probing the rocks for clues to one of the most vexing questions in all of science. Where did the moon come from? The answer promised to shed light on an even grander question. Where did Earth come from? And how did it evolve into the planet we know today?  

The nature of the moon began to come into focus four centuries ago. Galileo Galilei had heard of an instrument built by Dutch opticians capable of ""seeing faraway things as though nearby."" Galileo, in many ways the first modern scientist, saw this new instrument as a tool to help settle a long standing question. 

What was the nature of the heavens, and how did the world of men fit within it?

To some philosophers, the moon was a perfect, crystalline sphere of divine substance, free of Earth's imperfections. Galileo, with his telescope, saw a more familiar reality. He noted mountains and valleys on the moon, features like those of Earth. 

The astronauts of Apollo lifted off on a series of missions to get a close up look at the moon and perhaps settle the debate. Because there's no atmosphere there, the astronauts entered landscapes that are nearly frozen in time. They could scour the lunar surface for evidence of events going back almost to the time of its birth.

Indeed, eons of impacts had opened up the Moon's interior, leaving a wealth of information strewn about their landing sites. Scientists had already noticed that some large old craters were surrounded by concentric rings. You can see one of the most pronounced examples in this image of the Mare Orientale, captured recently by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO. The colors show differences in elevation. 

The old view was that the impact had melted the rock below. A newer view held that the impactor had actually splashed down on a molten surface. That gave rise to the radical notion that, early in its history, the moon's surface was covered in a vast ocean of magma.

When the astronauts arrived, they found relatively light rocks known as anorthosites. Their presence suggested that heavier material had sunk toward the moon's interior, forcing lighter material to the surface. 

The rocks they brought back were found to be strikingly similar to those on Earth, in part because they share forms of oxygen, called isotopes, that scientists regard as ""blood types"" for solar system bodies. Then there was this. The moon appeared to be completely, utterly, dry, with no evidence that water was ever present on its surface.",Birth of the Moon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGTBJHFNywI,-1,2208955,10655,932,3292,WGTBJHFNywI,"The Earth, over its 4.5 billion year history,
 has been pummeled by asteroids. Eroded by wind and rain. Covered over with flowing lava. Wrinkled and gouged by shifts in its crust. Most traces of its distant past have long
 since been destroyed. But there is a place where clues to the early
 history of our planet are still largely intact. The moon. Scientists have been reconstructing its history
 by scouring its surface, mapping its mountains and craters, and probing its interior regions. What are they learning about our own planet's
 beginnings, by going back in time, to the mysterious Birth of the Moon. The space age made possible rockets with enough
 power to blast humans and their life support systems into orbit. More than three hundred manned space flights
 have shown that humans can live and explore beyond our Earth. None of these missions have done more to shape
 our connection to the cosmos, and define who were are, than the fabled flights of Apollo. But not for reasons you might think. We sent astronauts to the moon as a symbol
 of confidence in the face of the great cold war struggle. Many hoped that would lead to further journeys
 to Mars, and to an age of living in space. Those goals proved too grand in the face of
 all the preoccupations, turbulence, and change that would crash onto our own planetary shores. Landing on the moon was a giant leap for mankind. But it's what the astronauts picked up from
 the lunar surface that may turn out to be Apollo's greatest legacy. When the astronauts of Apollo stepped out
 of their landing craft, they entered a world draped in fine sticky dust, strewn with rocks,
 and pocked with craters. They walked and rambled about, picking up
 rocks - 382 kilograms worth -- that they packed for the return flight. Back in earth-bound labs, scientists went
 to work probing the rocks for clues to one of the most vexing questions in all of science. Where did the moon come from? The answer promised to shed light on an even
 grander question. Where did Earth come from? And how did it evolve into the planet we know
 today? The apollo rocks have brought us closer to
 the answer, but basic mysteries still remain. The moon orbits Earth at an average distance
 of 384,400 kilometers. It's relatively small, with less than one
 percent the surface area, two percent the volume, and one percent the mass of Earth. With no atmosphere, temperatures range, in
 Celsius, from -233 degrees at night to 123 degrees during the day. As the brightest object in the night sky,
 the moon has guided people for millennia... by defining the rhythms of life and animating
 our myths. The nature of the moon began to come into
 focus four centuries ago. Galileo Galilei had heard of an instrument
 built by Dutch opticians capable of ""seeing faraway things as though nearby."" Galileo, in many ways the first modern scientist,
 saw this new instrument as a tool to help settle a long standing question. What was the nature of the heavens, and how
 did the world of men fit within it? To some philosophers, the moon was a perfect,
 crystalline sphere of divine substance, free of Earth's imperfections. Galileo, with his telescope, saw a more familiar
 reality. He noted mountains and valleys on the moon,
 features like those of Earth. Flash forward to the modern age of lunar studies. 1959 saw the first in a fleet of probes launched
 by the Soviet Union and the United States to shoot closeup pictures, take readings,
 and crash onto its surface. We learned then just how different the moon
 is from Earth, with its cratered and dessicated landscapes, and lack of a magnetic field. That intensified a debate about the moon's
 origin that went back centuries. The so-called fission theory, championed by
 George Howard Darwin, son of Charles Darwin, held that the moon was once part of the Earth,
 cast off by the rapid spin of its young parent. For proof, look no farther than the Pacific
 Ocean, a giant hole in the Earth's surface. Then there's the capture theory, which holds
 that the moon was a wayward object that floated through our solar system and was pulled into
 orbit by Earth's gravity. A third idea came from the American astronomer
 Thomas Jefferson Jackson See, also known for his attacks on Einstein's theories and for
 charges of plagerism that were leveled at him. He suggested that the Moon formed near Earth
 and gradually fell under its gravitational spell. In that case, the moon should be a mini-Earth,
 which we now know it's not. The astronauts of Apollo lifted off on a series
 of missions to get a close up look at the moon and perhaps settle the debate. Because there's no atmosphere there, the astronauts
 entered landscapes that are nearly frozen in time. They could scour the lunar surface for evidence
 of events going back almost to the time of its birth. Indeed, eons of impacts had opened up the
 Moon's interior, leaving a wealth of information strewn about their landing sites. Scientists had already noticed that some large
 old craters were surrounded by concentric rings. You can see one of the most pronounced examples

 isotopes, that scientists regard as ""blood types"" for solar system bodies. Then there was this. The moon appeared to be completely, utterly,
 dry, with no evidence that water was ever present on its surface. Not long after the last Apollo mission went
 into the history books, this initial evidence coalesced into a radical new idea first presented
 in 1974 by the scientist and artist, William Hartmann. His theory of the moon's formation is played
 out in this contemporary scenario. Sharing an orbit with Earth was a Mars-sized
 body called Theia, named for a Titan in Greek myth who gave birth to the moon goddess, Selene. Its orbit became unstable and it headed in
 Earth's direction. Theia hit at an oblique angle, causing the
 Earth to spin faster and debris from both Theia and the Earth to fly into orbit. When the dust settled, the debris began to
 coalesced in Earth orbit, forming the Moon. By then, volatile compounds like water had
 evaporated. The moon, then, comes primarily from the mantles
 of the Earth and Theia. That's why overall the moon is lighter, or
 less dense, than Earth. It has a core of solid iron like Earth, but
 this core is relatively small compared to ours. From this violent beginning, the moon gradually
 coole, and the magma that lined its surface hardened into a crust. Yet it was still subject to intense bombardment
 in the chaotic environment of the early solar system. You can see what a battering the moon has
 taken in this global elevation map compiled by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Its surface has been hammered by large impacts
 at every stage in its history. The Apollo astronauts encountered a secondary
 effect of all the impacts, rocks formed in the crucible of widespread volcanism. On Earth, volcanic eruptions are often powered
 by water, heated and pressurized by friction from the movement of immense tectonic plates. Neither factor exists on the Moon. Instead, lunar volcanoes are tied to impacts
 forceful enough to melt the surface and release material from the hot interior. In the lower gravity of the Moon, volcanic
 eruptions would have splattered high above the landscape. Molten rock then flowed out in thin smooth
 layers that reached far from its source. That's how the mare regions that cover about
 one-sixth of the entire lunar surface were formed. These immense volcanic basins are thought
 to date back to period of large and violent impacts from three to four billion years ago. The materials brought up by these impacts
 are made up of heavier compounds that would have initially sunk into the magma ocean. Scientists have also detected volcanic residues
 in recent impacts that have been imaged by LRO cameras. This is the Aristarchus Plateau with a mysterious
 channel cut by flowing lava and punctuated by two immense craters. One was created by an impact just 450 million
 years ago. Along its walls are blocks of rock from the
 lunar crust that fragmented in the impact. Scientists detected volcanic glass-like deposits
 that are the legacy of ancient eruptions. Then there's the strange landscape of the
 Tycho crater, from an impact about 100 million years ago. Its central peak, rising two kilometers above
 the crater floor, may be material blasted out by the impact. The same is true for a 120-meter wide boulder
 that sits on the summit. Around it, and on it, scientists see evidence
 of rock that was melted in the heat of the impact itself. Since its birth, the moon has exerted a constant
 and powerful influence on Earth. Gravitational drag from the moon slows Earth's
 rotation by 2.3 milliseconds per century... while causing the moon to drift away at a
 rate of 3.8 centimeters per year. The moon's tidal pull acts to stabilize Earth's
 rotation about its axis, and the tides help promote the formation of ocean currents that
 shape our climate. To think that the root of this intimate relationship
 between Earth and the moon stems from a violent collision so long ago. However, the giant impact theory is not universally
 accepted. For one thing, there's the issue of water. The dryness of the moon is consistent with
 the giant impact theory, which predicts that water and other volatile compounds would have
 evaporated out of the lunar debris cloud. But the moon may not be so dry after all. In 1998, the unmanned Lunar Prospector began
 an ambitious mission to map the lunar surface with an instrument called a gamma-ray spectrometer. The data showed that hydrogen is spread widely
 across the poles of the moon. If it's from ice, millions of tons of water
 could well be embedded in the soil there. It turns out there are places where water
 can exist on the moon, where the sun never shines. Polar craters, forever in shadow, could shelter
 significant quantities of ice against solar radiation. Prospecting for ice, the LCross probe arrived
 at the moon in 2009 aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, on a collision course with the 97
 kilometer wide Cabeus Crater at the south pole. Seconds after it slammed into the crater,
 a trailing probe detected a tenuous cloud rising up from the crater. In the cloud was a mix of carbon monoxide,
 ammonia, methane, and more. 5.6% of the crater floor is water ice, a higher
 concentration than some areas on Earth. The presence of water is good news for explorers
 who dream of one day spending quality time on the moon. But how did it get there? It might have been delivered by comets striking
 the moon over the eons. There's another explanation, one that emerged
 from rocks gathered by the Apollo astronauts. The samples are graced with tiny glassy globules,
 minerals melted in the crucible of lunar volcanism. Analysing these Apollo rocks with new techniques,
 several teams of scientists have found a compound called hydroxyl. It's H2O, with only one H, and could be turned
 into water, say, for a moon base. Much of what the moon had was likely lost
 to space from impacts. Tiny residues might remain in polar craters. The rest, still locked up inside the moon,
 might be enough to cover its surface in a layer of water one meter deep. Does the presence of water inside the moon
 send us back to square one on its formation? It might not, if it had been carried in by
 comets in the moon's early days. One new study suggests that the giant impact
 scenario is more complex than we thought. It holds that another, much smaller body formed
 alongside the moon and eventually merged with it. The impact literally rearranged the moon's
 interior, pushing molten magma onto the near side, while adding an extra layer of crust
 to the far side. That explains the lopsided topography of the
 moon, the dark lava basins on the near side, and the highlands of the far side. Human geologists with a network of seismographs
 could confirm this idea. The next best thing is a mission called Grail,
 a pair of spacecraft orbiting the moon in unison. Such a mission has already performed a kind
 of planetary CAT-scan of Earth. By measuring subtle changes in the distance
 between the craft, scientists discerned variations in Earth's gravity. The data resulted in a map of ground water
 all around the planet. Flying around the moon, the Grail pair could
 provide new details about the size and composition of the Moon's core, adding support for the
 giant impact theory, or sending science in a whole new direction. The intimate connection between the Earth
 and the moon appears to trace back to their earliest times. If that's true, then the formation of this
 desolate world can tell us about our own... A blue green world with a companion reflective
 enough to light up the night. ?? ?? ?? ?? 7"

Our top story this morning...
A hectic day of diplomacy lies ahead for South Korean President Moon Jae-in as the G20 Summit in Osaka officially kicks off in the coming hours.
Later on this Friday, President Moon will take part in a leaders' session... where the member states will discuss the global economy and international trade.
He will also hold talks with a handful of his global counterparts, including a crunch meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key player in efforts to denuclearize North Korea.
Park Hee-jun reports from Osaka.
On the opening day of the G20 Osaka Summit on Friday,... President Moon Jae-in will engage in economic discussions... focused on addressing the global uncertainties brought about by the U.S.-China trade conflict.
A session will be held on the global economy, trade, and investment,... one of the four themes of the 14th G20 meeting.
President Moon is expected to share his government's fiscal policies,... including his push for a supplementary budget bill.
He is also expected to call for joint diplomatic efforts among the G20 nations,... in addressing global economic issues, including trade tensions.
With the G20 being one of the first bodies to take action,... in combating the global financial crisis in 2008,... active discussions will be held to prevent such a meltdown from happening again.

President Moon will also be occupied with a scheduled summit with Indonesia,... and pull-aside talks with India and the Netherlands.
But attention mainly focuses on President Moon meeting a key player in the North Korea denuclearization talks Russia.
This is perhaps the most important discussion of the day,... in terms of furthering his peace drive on the Korean Peninsula.
President Moon is expected to learn of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's thoughts from Kim's bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin in April,... and ask for Russia's continued support for his peace drive on the Korean Peninsula.

""And besides the series of meetings,... there's the question of whether President Moon will be able to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. President Moon made it clear that he's willing to meet... to resolve the forced labor dispute between the two countries. He’s open to a last-minute meeting,... but this appears to depend entirely on Japan. Park Hee-jun, Arirang News, Osaka.""

 Gregory W. Nemitz registered some land containing 492 quintillion dollars worth of platinum. The land was right here... well, over here - an asteroid named 433 Eros.
 Not a single sovereign nation on earth recognizes human claims to
 extraterrestrial real estate, but he did it anyway.
 And then, less than a year later, NASA landed a probe on the asteroid. They called it the first asteroid
 we had ever landed a probe on. Nemitz called it ""parking space number 29""
 and promptly sent NASA a 20 dollar parking ticket.
 But so far, NASA and the US Attorney General 
 have dismissed the fine, saying that his claim to own the asteroid is without legal merit. But why? Plenty of organizations exists that will
 gladly take your money in return for land on the Moon, Venus, Mars.
 And if you had enough money to go to the Moon, nothing is legally stopping you from moving there, building a house with a significant
 other, having some kids and turning your Moon house into a Moon home.
 It wouldn't be trespassing or squatting or stealing.
 The 1979 Moon Treaty says that no one can own any part of outer space ever, but only 11 states have signed it.
 However, 129 nations have signed and/or ratified the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, which says that outer
 space is not subject to national appropriation.
 It says nothing about a private individual or a company owning part of outer space. But without the recognition and support
 of at least one sovereign nation, what does ownership really mean? I mean, I can claim anything I want.
 I can claim to own Prospect Park in Brooklyn, but just saying that I do or
 even moving there and living in Prospect Park wouldn't
 entitle me to the rights that usually go along with ownership, unless someone with a bunch of power agreed that I owned it and could enforce
 that ownership and keep others from claiming to also own it.
 In the past, explorers had few qualms about claiming to own land, even if other humans were already there,
 because they had power on their side - mainly plenty of guns, Germs and Steel.
 To paraphrase con artist Canada Bill Jones, ""you know what beats four aces? A gun.""
 Or as @lawblob pointed out, McDonald's actually does serve
 breakfast after 10:30, if you have a gun. If you claimed some
 land on the Moon as your own and moved in, would you also have to hire your own lunar police and Cislunar military to defend it and
 to keep others from challenging your claim?
 Pretty much. That's kind of the problem.
 Currently it is risky for individuals or corporations to claim and use extraterrestrial territory
 because the Outer Space Treaty says that outer space is the common heritage of mankind.
 It belongs to all of us and only to all of us. Many interpretations of the Outer Space
 Treaty predict that powerful things like nations would be reluctant to come to your
 defense should someone else want to move in or cause trouble or dispute your extraterrestrial claim. Maybe you could get the sovereign nation
 to weigh in on your behalf by declaring universal jurisdiction but that would need to be for an
 incredibly terrible heinous crime, a crime against all of humanity, not just a dispute over a few space rocks. Catherine Doldirina from the
 Institute of Air & Space Law at McGill University suggests that considering outer space, the common heritage of mankind, has slowed space exploration. You see, the Outer Space Treaty was based
 on the Antarctic Treaty, which says that the entire continent shall never become the scene or object
 of international discord. Discord is not a good thing, but
 without an incentive to profit from it, not much has happened there,
 as opposed to the Arctic, where a resource boom is
 currently underway. If people felt safer appropriating and
 taking advantage of space, of celestial bodies, if technological development was more incentivized, would we already have orbiting tourist attractions and lunar hotels?
 Maybe. But here is what you can currently own in outer space: stuff you put there and, to a certain extent, orbits. The Outer Space Treaty says that the
 stuff we left on the move, anything put into space, remains property of the original owner forever.
 Orbits around earth are temporarily granted by the
 International Telecommunication Union, a UN agency;
 but they don't work like typical real estate on Earth.
 When a group of Equatorial nations attempted to claim orbits above their
 land boundaries, without planning on putting satellites there, their claim was largely ignored. So you not only need to ask the UN for an orbit and get permission,
 you also need to use it and fill it. It's a little disappointing that we
 don't know how lunar real estate works or if it will, but it's exciting to know that we,
 within our lifetimes, might have a chance to be part of the solution. A unique generation not visiting space
 for the first time, but homesteading it for the first time. Here's another unresolved space law quandary. If an alien landed in your backyard, intelligent life from beyond Earth, and you shot it with a gun, dressed it and then cooked up,
 you and your family, some alien meat fajitas, would that be hunting or murder? We literally don't know.
 On earth, we have human rights, but there are no alien rights. Maybe it would fall under the category of cultural vandalism, an act that's not necessarily a legal, but is a giant bummer to the rest of humanity.
 This has happened before - not with aliens - but with paintings. In 2003, the Chapman brothers purchased
 one of the few remaining sets of Goya's Fantastic Disasters of War. Instead of displaying the works for the
 public, they defaced them by drawing clown and puppy heads on the people. They called the work ""insult to injury."" In protest, a man threw red paint on
 Jake Chapman when he appeared at Modern Art Oxford, but at the end of the day,
 what the Chapman brothers did wasn't illegal.
 They owned the paintings. Vandalizing the Moon or killing a peaceful alien aren't illegal acts, but just like defacing historical
 paintings, they seem wrong on some deeper level, especially since because in
 most museums you usually can't even touch the paintings. But who was the first person to touch the Moon with their bare hands? I mean, the guys who walked around on the
 Moon wore space suits, they had material in between their skin and the Moon.
 Well, to be sure, you already have the Moon in your hands. Well, little Moons.
 Lunula. The crescent-shaped area at the base of
 your fingernail, where tissue is thicker and the red
 vascular structures underneath are more hidden, making it white.
 And to be even more sure, at the quantum level touch is
 problematic. As I've covered before, atomically speaking, matter never really contacts other matter in the conventional sense.
 You can't truly touch anything.
 MinutePhysics called it interaction over a short distance. With that in mind, NASA says the Terry Slezak was the first person to
 touch the Moon with his bare hands. He was a technician
 in quarantine, who accidentally got lunar soil smeared all over his hand while removing film magazines from the astronauts' cameras.
 But when Armstrong and Aldrin returned to the lunar module after their moonwalk and removed their
 helmets, they came into contact with lunar dust they tracked in on their suits.
 They even reported its odor, saying it smelled of spent gunpowder or ashes, possibly because it oxidized on contact with the air in the cabin.
 Point is, the first few breaths of Moon dusty air that Armstrong and Aldrin took in were our first fleshly contact with the Moon. Or were they?
 Walking around on earth every day I am surrounded by material that recently was in outer space. Hundreds of metric
 tons of extraterrestrial rock falls to Earth every year.
 Some from the Moon, but most from asteroids, ejected by a high-speed impact and
 eventually caught by Earth's gravity.
 Some pieces are big enough to see, but most are pulverized by our atmosphere
 during entry into tiny particles that disperse in the air, becoming a tiny fraction of the very dust and dirt we clean up and breathe in every day. There's microscopic space dust, pieces of asteroids and even the Moon all around us. In fact, there might be microscopic
 pieces of the Moon under your bed right now or even under your fingernails. Which means the
 first human to have fleshly contact with lunar material was the first Homo Sapien hundreds of
 thousands of years ago to walk on dirt. We are still studying
 exactly how much cosmic dust is in the air that we breathe every day, but it's safe to say that every once in
 a while you inhale some material that was recently in outer space, some of which thousands of
 years ago was on the Moon. Was the Moon. And just like other
 particulates in our atmosphere, large enough pieces get trapped in the
 mucus that protects our lungs, meaning that picking your nose is gross, but every once in a while,
 a booger could literally be out of this world. And as always, thanks for watching."

President Moon Jae-in kicked off his schedule in Osaka with one of the most important meetings he'll have in Japan: talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

moonlanding,"NASA offered an insanely detailed and up-close view of Earth's moon when its Goddard Space Flight Center released a 4K virtual tour on Monday, April 9. _x000D_

The U.S. space agency reports the data for the video was retrieved by its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft.

oh my god what a war my ho either welcome everyone oh man the classic the classic camera turned on a little too early isn't that funny what other bits are we gonna do tonight tip of the iceberg yeah that's gonna do who's on first classic bit what's another classic bit we're gonna do banana peel joke fart sound fart sound classic rubber chicken noise oh hold is that oh yeah the clown knows that's the sound of rubber chicken makes dildo factory no no that's I don't know what a dildo is I don't know where they when come from or what they're used for that was pitch to it to do something in a factory yeah the wind has never been sucked out of their home harder oh yeah because I don't know what a dildo is and that you know do you know what a vibrator is that what you what's in the chair that massages your back yeah a sharper image that yeah that could vibrate yes and massage like a sore muscle group yeah so Oh my mom had this vibrator and she muscles yeah she said she put on her face to massage her face at night so I'd hear all this vibrating coming through the walls at night and I'd be like what's that sound she's like us my face massager theme song so I I dunno what that is the song please I'm just trying to be somebody besides below me Hosemann got my gun at my side I'm just trying to be anyways I think my mom would go crazy on those massages because she must not God sweaty cuz that thing smelled hoping that conversation would end brings wet um you were talking about a pitch someone pitching a gag that sucked the wind out of the room yes again Sean referring to someone once pitched us when we were writing past video somebody suggested doing the whole thing in a dildo factory it was kind of like okay that did happen once but I actually think there was a pitch that sucked the wind out of the room even faster I know however however sadly I was the only witness to it oh you'll have to take my word for it it's gonna be up there with the Mitt Romney sighting where we're gonna question it and fight it whatever but we worked with a company once made I don't remember if ever told the story or not so if I have I'm really sorry but we worked with a company once that pitched well I think the video that we were doing for them just kind of needed some work or we were writing ideas for it and they generally liked it but they wanted some other stuff to it that way and fire that PR guy called me kind of late at night he's like I'm in another time zone can you can you receive a call right now and I was like I'm up yeah it's no big deal he's like okay and so he called me up and he said okay you know I know we're kind of looking for some other things to spice up this video I've got a wild idea and feel free and it's just food for thought I mean just take this for what it is you don't have to do it but I just kind of have a crazy idea yeah and he and he seriously it was about 20 minutes Oh deep you go into this sex shop okay alright and you get and I'm talking you get it all you're picking up you're buying dildos you're buying whips you know the kind of not just regular whip you know your lips Kelly cat-o'-nine-tails tape getting your but he just went on for like ten minutes of what I could buy at this store it was like yeah and you're going around town and you're using the whip don't hit me with that and it sounds like are you gonna use all this stuff it's like oh and then you bring it back yeah and you try to return it to the store refund I was like yeah yeah and they what they're not there they're like ah this is used yeah it's got sweat on and I'm waiting for the rest of it I'm waiting for the rest of it was like yeah so I don't know guys take it or leave it but I just thought that that was there again so well but really that would it went on ten times longer him just describing each item and I was just like I don't and I didn't that was one of those moments you know a lot of times when we get calls about stuff I have to like run you know yeah the other guys aren't here let me run this by them that was one where I was like oh man I'm just gonna speak for the other guys in the heart now needless to say we never worked with McDonald's I'm gonna say never say never but not that night anyway yeah that was a such a horrendously awkward call but other than that the dildo factory was bad too yeah Wow the logistics of that would never worked out cuz one a sex shop isn't gonna give anyone permission to film inside their business hidden-camera exposing all those customers my style is pervert yeah you don't get it 1s pass just hide a camera and you know like you would in normal a store girl a style a second Kevin's laughing behind whenever you get Kevin laughing you feel pretty good about you know you guys can see that but we got Kevin they've never invented a camera that goes in the pee pee hole just imagine they do Beck did of a porno film from the POV of the people that I care but camera stuff firm not personally someone I know yeah that's the thing endoscopic they stick the camera in to check for some stones they need to blast oh wait all the freaks in the in the chat are telling me it already exists all right listen everybody that was a test yeah you failed and I just identified the freaks this moment and smoked out the Pearl Brian right all their usernames down Oh Brian's taking your names down we put you on the blacklist which is gonna know your name and you're gonna you know what now I know who in the chat jerks off Oh found you got caught jerkin you know what's another good way to find that out is you go at Comic Con when they did that we - hold on does he still have they used to at San Diego Comic Con the it wasn't an uncommon thing in the past that you would see a booth that just had a porn star sitting at it and I never saw that does that happen still to be 18 up section 18 there up there was a period where there was just a straight-up Suicide Girls booth Yeah right but I Captain America there yeah what's comments stupid no but uh I remember because I remember at one point in our early days of doing Comic Con we talked about doing a segment where I was getting in line at all of those booths that just had porn stars or whoever and I was just gonna be like trying to make conversation with all the guys in the line like like jerking off - I just remember we talked about that at one point but it never never happened but that would have been a good way to find that out is you just ask him but that I remember that was that was a fairly common thing you still get like the cosplay deviance is as close as you get I think yeah you know what I never people who would like and I'm gonna indict myself a little bit cuz I have a picture with this guy he's jerks off but people who would line up to meet Ron germy well here's the thing Darrin you do a picture with that guy yeah I saw him at a comedy club oh well I saw him at comic-con and I was there too you to autograph but not from him he's with Beetlejuice from Howard Stern and that was way more exciting and I have the autograph still I didn't get Ron Jeremy's autograph I didn't let me yeah I didn't but beetlejuice he's the real star there so yeah you know just like Ron I'm a fan of your work man you're just so good right I know somebody who went to I think it was the premiere of that movie director's cut I think only me and Kevin are the ones at the Pentagon yeah yeah yeah and oh of course Brian you were oh yeah you were there you weren't it you weren't in my immediate peripheral vision though so I just forgot to bring that up but um anyway uh but there was a premiere of that movie in Hollywood and someone who was there was Phil ron jeremy was at the premiere and it's hilarious because they are filming the Q&A in this video that's on youtube they're filming the Q&A and then they keep going over to ron jeremy who was in the audience like oh yeah he's got the video of him sleeping to a comment he's got let's see oh is that for real I filmed that video and uploaded it and people informed me that that was a case and I took it down oh yeah I didn't know that either Sean Center that bit when I did that on Tuesday no cuz we need to edit what if they fall into our trap only you know okay I'm sure when when it you can leave the footage in but just put this is a teachable moment ron jeremy falls asleep yeah that's controllably I could think of worse thing get sex it's win-win it's give and take people in the chatter saying they thought I was bending over to self sock Ron can do it yeah that would have been way I wasn't distress shout his spine from falling asleep so suddenly all when you were in seventh grade when your head always drops and he could just go to that position when you were in saying he just woke up with the dick in his mouth like that's how you do that yeah oh I have a condition and a talent rare yeah but mistakes into miracles Oh when you were in seventh grade you heard about Marilyn Manson Ramin his own rib what does it do that were you like what a loser or were you like no I thought that's what I thought and I believed it for the record totally believe yeah back then rumors held some weight and you couldn't look it up because the fact checking is this is what Kyle said canceled I always thought sucking your own dick would make you gay yeah but I think that there's a deep philosophical debate to be had yeah there's a line you know cuz is it masturbatory or is it homosexual I think there's a line I don't think sucking your own dick is gay but coming in your own mouth might be when you whack off you got jizz in your hand but yeah that's outside my orifices hmm so hey you know what if you want to do it go for it if you can't do it go for it last topic of the week I think I know what I have an opinion on this I just occurred to me but I want to get her oh no I was just gonna say in my opinion it's just like eating your own boogers it's like no no I don't care no that's not even the aspect I'm talking about it's just yeah you don't need a dude come on that's the what are you doing yeah there's crackers in the go II don't know I yogurt in the fridge yeah again I'm not here to judge you if you want to eat your own boogers or you want to suck your own dick like whatever you want to do I died here to judge chopping anybody but what is what are the implications about your identity oh I don't get that I don't think that much about anything I do so here's what I think it all depends on what is stimulating you are you enjoying the mouth on your wiener or the Weiner in your mouth God think about it oh it's like a chicken or the eggs yeah exactly exactly what what's more pleasurable to you that's how you figure anybody in the chat that says move on in the next bit has delayed this bits gonna go on 20 whatever e person say this is this is the podcast you move on to the next podcast yeah this is the podcast now show now now it was gonna be a one-minute bit and now we're at 74 minute bit hey this is Pride Month you know we got days or else we gotta save it til next year we're morally obligated so let's do this if you're if you're not down with Germany wherever or wherever wherever they don't celebrate it yeah we're don't they probably in Antarctica Antarctica freeze your ass off is there anything cool in Antarctica penguins or they North herself I didn't see march of the Penguins yeah I didn't see that it's you know what let me these nature documentaries they bum me out always you always get attached to some eaten up or dies by itself and you film like nature I know that is the thing planet Earth one of my favorite things ever filmed incredible so there's this one shot of a baby elephant walking in the wrong direction of all his mom's footprints the wrong way and is going to it I have not gone over that so that's brutal see that's my view on all life that should not just nature documentaries to me that's everything sucks sad yeah oh well periodically things are good new video game comes out new movie comes out new Harry Potter book comes out good distraction Star Wars man you go to it this is fun and you for a second you forget that it's a dog-eat-dog world and sometimes you're just an elephant walk in the wrong way yeah yeah but that's how people are saying that happens every to see sorry puppies drowned in a river all kinds of nasty horrible things go on Dexter yeah you'll never be the same stop listening to the sort of killer podcast you have I have right now I don't have any and someone recommended to me we've done some have been like hey Sean you love this one and I think no no I'm done now listen to what about NASA totally fine about the moon landing okay Oh boss oh here's a sports rivalry fine I'm listening to that stuff right now I moved past so you're into like pseudoscience like maybe maybe boring to you but it's not about dead people so I'm more into that right now you were on your way to become a serial killer though yeah yeah hard left yes hard left now I'm an astronaut people get serially killed all the time going to the moon but no one's ever going to the moon I'm going to the moon all NASA's all forces I heard well the to me this podcast is headed in the direction of one of those death murder podcasts so I'm gonna spin it around from that okay well I'm gonna talk about something so uniquely positive it can only be yes it can only be described as a miracle okay what I you know if you guys have watched this podcast before you know I've talked before extensively about Matt Stone and Trey Parker's work their biography you know and in which in which they've starred in movies such as cannibal the musical and bass ketball among others and they've you know mingled with many Hollywood luminaries and dentists no oh yes and dentists I thought you met Dennis but anyway yeah and so you know I put that energy out in the world many times not just once but over and over and over again yeah and so what happened this last weekend there was a concert I had tickets for forever Kevin and I went to elo the elo concert in Anaheim and we went this whole arena was a huge arena show and there were two empty seats next to me and I'm like are they they're just people not showing up and these this this guy walks in front of me and he sits right down next to me it's Trey Parker no was the guy who played squeak in bass ketball and he was also cannibal the musical what are the odds that he would sit down near you it must have been the celebrity section you forget Orgazmo he starred in Orgazmo with the ron jeremy himself yeah well circle out of all the people he could have sat next to in that whole arena he sat down next to me and for about ten minutes I was like Kevin I might do I say something Kevin amaya dick oh because I don't want to make him uncomfortable right now but I said hey I'm really sorry I like to stretch out and no but he couldn't have been a nicer guy yeah super nice guy and he had been to all the elo shows that you know when he's come to California recently and was telling me all about whatever super cool dude and anyway I just got to meet someone that was part of history hmm so that's all I want to say is you put that energy out there it comes back to you you two might sit next to squeak I feel like if it was me I would have waited till the end of the show yeah tonight because awkward well I've had people on time I was on a flight in this guy recognized me who sat next to me and the first thing you said was they recognized me and he was a big fan and then he was like struggling to find things to say after that and I think he was thinking I should have saved this for later and then because he could yeah all this but now I know he's like and I am you so I'm like you know yeah you're on your best behavior you're not talking to me about upcoming Vidya said you know what he was actually sitting one seat away from me when he usually said now i'ma once I said the thing he said and I had conversation going on with Kevin I wasn't just sitting there like looking at him right we had a road thing going on sure taking selfies with him but I did mention that I told I did give the history of cannibal news ago Podcast oh you said that to him mention that I said I said I think that energy brought you here that oh my god love doll yeah yeah cool so anyway it can happen to you guys be positive put that energy out in the errors so yeah we were at a Paul McCartney concert last night yeah we were um let's get it out of the way no he did not play temporary secretary I know I don't know he's his DJ played it to warm up the crowd before yeah um yeah I was very disappointed in that he played that he played Blackbird and he played ah some of the Jews like an idiot yeah but he didn't play that but um did you see any celebrities there last night so no but I wasn't on the floor Rocco was on the floor Wow ma I saw I saw Ming Na ming-na wen who's that she was she was an ER she was Chun Li in the original Street Fighter movie you have don't know how that works I just got I got radar for how what is that for whatever lists like there's no way that anyone ever recognizes her but Rocco can do it no I disagree she's been a lot of stuff no one could recognize squeak from bass ketball maybe I'll give you but I think if you know if you know is working you see I think she was the voice of Mulan yeah I think she was really Wow yeah but uh yeah I've been there when the celebrity gets recognized and anyone knows who they barraco is like yeah you were the background character of that one episode of that one it's that yeah yeah yeah I've done that with actors who were in lost I see him in like Disneyland and stuff I've seen I've yeah I'll only say something if I feel like you know what no one is probably no one else is probably gonna bug him right do you know what I mean like but if you see you know Brad Pitt yeah I'm like dude this guy's getting harassed no I'm not gonna see or Adam Sandler's like a guy who blew up and lost I'm lost yeah I'm saying Adam Sandler we left a you know after he yelled know at a sweet but anyway Adam Sandler put out a new movie with Jennifer Aniston on Netflix what murder yes three whoa was it good well I think I'm gonna have to call it I think I'm getting sick of Adam stamp oh there it is with all of these I I don't like comedies where the whole comedy is I'm old now I'm old I'm we've been married for so long it sucks we gotta was the whole gist of it it's to get hard no like him and Jennifer Aniston are pick me up some claritin from the store okay I gotta get gotta get some claritin for the wife Oh exedra cheaper I just get that for her what is this these are the pills I wanted dude those oh sorry won't get you comedy movie do they use those two drugs my name yeah cuz that's product placement advertisement like the new Ray Romano thing he had a new stand-up special oh yeah comedians just their whole shtick is I'm old now is turn them off find the off switch hit it I like when they do a pregnancy stand-up comedian like whether they're pregnant on stage and does that happen oh like three stand-up comedians all head specials last year where they full-term pregnant I give birth on stage now you tell a joke that's one hell of a funny that close they could keep it going during the labor yeah no a section why you're telling you whoa I need this like I need their whole in my all three comedians thought of that like hey this is perfect this is gonna be my this is gonna be my niche thing and then once the first one calling their editors like how far out are we I'm trying to think of movies or TV shows where somebody mentioned it in the chat we're like somebody was pregnant he had to hide it I know the idea I saw in Frasier they did that and who did the rag name he's like sitting down and I honestly was like see how fast she got it was nothing but fat jokes on her you can't do this and it was just like put down the cookies Daphne Jesus haven't you noticed sure I go and they show us the refrigerator and they put like a pig sound effect for her when she what does it hurt I swear to God Daphne you fat it really was like hey just don't call it don't hear blues a call yeah and then when she had the baby they said I'll tell you literally is they're off to fat camp to lose the weight that's in Frasier yes shame to lose weight no it really wasn't it was terrible it was better than her being pregnant you know yeah that they couldn't know that would suck if that would happen aisles would have been jealous you know yeah it wouldn't work yeah wouldn't worked I want to say they did that was like one of the x-men to like one of them like in one of the x-men movies someone's hidden I think hiding it is fine or whatever or not quiet into it I guess it's yeah whatever but Charles Xavier that's why he's in that chair the whole uses his mind to get himself pregnant classic x-men bit I am I wasn't on though I think the last podcast I think yeah but someone I heard through the grapevine Garrett gave Dark Phoenix a good review yes yeah I couldn't avoid that news because it was the only one that I know of yeah did people really hate it that bad yeah yeah Pierce yes I don't know it seemed right in line with every other but yeah they're all good enough to see once in the theater and then it's like alright it didn't have like plot holes are like bad Gigi or like horrible dialogue or like in like unwatchable acting like everything was just Park yeah it just is mind-blowing to me that they did the Phoenix thing already badly yeah expertly no and then 13 years later they're like alright fine like it's worse see I don't mind I think it's much better than x-men 3 the last dance oh you think oh I did see that one that one was terrible yeah I have no horsin I haven't seen them anyone but so I was curious the UNC toy straight for yeah interesting yeah no no anyone who saw it it underperformed well I could tell cuz no one thought I didn't do as well and there was only saw the true Toy Story the whole child's play oh how is that child's play is not a bad movie it's not a good movie sounds like dark feeling it's not a scary movie it's not scary it's it's not a family-friendly movie it is a movie that is so bad it becomes one of the greatest films of all time whoa it is a Mystery Science Theater movie with no jokes Oh with no commentary track was it trying to be funny or just was both okay okay both uh for the first half hour I was movie up this makes no sense this book this blue and then something like broke inside of my brain and I went why do I let go nobody making this movie gave a and from that point on I could not stop laughing at this movie to the point where it became like really enjoyable once I was like programmed to like out disappoint oh he went nuts Chucky is weird what he's not like demonic he's just weird that's the spoiler free review is any Mark Hamill Mark Hamill plays Chucky yeah yeah all right so this is what I read after I saw the movie MGM owns the rights to child's play one Universal owns the rights to child play two three four five six seven a lot of the box sets didn't have one in it when they yeah this is an MGM movie legally they can remake child's play one but they can't involve anything from any of the subsequent movies including what Chucky looks like voodoo interesting any any similar kills all the backstories so yeah so basically I was just gonna sit the TV show there's a TV show coming by the other studio oh my and that's going to continue the existing yeah the Bride of Chucky theater Chuck yeah yeah this movie really has very little to do with child's play yeah Chucky's backstory is completely different the doll looks different he acts different it was just in but I know afterwards it all kind of made sense Chucky has like this et glowing finger Lincoln wirelessly like bluetooth bluetooth connect with all all electronics including like the main character kid has a hearing aid and Chucky could like hack into it Oh Andy now you can hear me yeah he's got the highly recommend it I will see this I'm a big connoisseur of Aubrey Plaza oh yeah she's see she's pretty cool awesome Plaza plays the mother in this movie I'm yeah yeah that seemed like weird yeah do this kid but then after a while I was that's not the point of this movie it goes like Monster Squad like it just oh really it doesn't make sense and I was like this movie's doesn't make sense then yeah you know uh can I can I tell you how Chucky comes to be I sure couldn't care less yeah right ahead I'll see you but I'm not invested this is the first 10 minutes of the movie Chucky's made in Vietnam so it goes to some Factory in Vietnam and there's a guy who's making a bunch of Chuckies and he's like staring off into space and his boss comes up literally in Vietnamese hey I told you to stop daydreaming and slaps him whoa slaps to the guy for daydream that's how they do it in view and it goes finish this doll and then you're out of here you're back on the street like where I found you before I hired you I got fired for daydreaming in addition to being slapped by as long so the boss walks away and the guy gets it gets on his computer it starts like recoding the Chucky and all bad language inhibitor disable violence inhibitor which in retrospect is really funny yeah that they program chuckling to be violent and then hit her in it at which point somebody could just disable it like hey this doll knows how to stab people and shoot guns um let's inhibit that okay put a lock on it just make sure nobody turns out I can't turn that off so the guy like does all that and then for reasons unknown throws himself off the building and commits suicide and he's out manager China they got nets for that in Vietnam he just splat he's out of the picture huh which uh which I was reading a review is like I don't know why the guy killed himself I was like yeah I don't either he got his revenge so then this uh this programmed to America and we're off and running Chucky because before this doll a strip doll he's still a doll yeah yeah but now he's like a robot doll well he's like a smart toy he's got like bluetooth capabilities now hmm whereas Chucky before was just like pull the string and he he talks to you Bluetooth capability and he's not inherently evil but he like learns to be evil but that's I mean that's giving it too much credit yes it's just an awful movie that is awesome go in it's not a horror movie cuz it's not scary whatsoever just expect the blackest dark comedy you've ever seen in your life just treat it like a straight-up comedy because they go for straight comedy a lot throughout the movie it's filled with comedic actors it's filled with comedic scenarios and jokes and punchlines and then it's like unintentionally even funnier than they could have ever imagined because it's so gonzo hmm I heard danzig made a horror movie called the four rot I think it's named after his comic book company or something like that not Lady Death I think it's a ver otic or something and it's an anthology which a lot of indie horror movies go for the anthology like the four short stories but apparently it's finally getting screened I heard about him making this like for ten years and when it got screened it was met with eruptions of laughter all at inappropriate parts of the movie and during the Q&A Glenn gets up there he's like you guys really cracked up a lot of the stuff I thought was serious and now it's getting a tour and I I wonder if it's under the same guys were like he really intended it to be a seriously scary and horrific movie and it's just funny as hell because they seriously like play it up for comedy okay there's like there's like stupid stuff that's supposed to be like haha funny yeah but it kind of like ruins the movie for me a goes off the deep yes stuff go starts course do they set it up for a sequel so the MGM can now spawn there there was a problem there I think there is already a sequel it's gonzo its gonzo it's not bad it's not good transcends like traditional film critique because you know like they're just having fun they got they got a couple million whatever they're like let's just make a funny walk in like history of violence is a movie where I started laughing and yeah Joey and I wasn't prepared to but by the end I was loving it like so I succeed on the stairs yeah everything about it was like the movie was happening was that - it was just happening I was so excited to see a good size movie and buy it like we like I'll onboard yeah like the happening was an entertaining movie to me once again something in my mind bro yeah okay you know what Mike my be stupid I support you being stupid now talking to a plan hell yes yeah man nothing beats that scene man when when when Mark Wahlberg is talking down that tree begging him not to kill him yeah grabs the branch and goes yes the death scenes are so ridiculous they're so god-awful bad they become hilarious and I don't want to spoil any you know it's I'm not gonna describe them but you know I say people out there you want to have a good laugh go in expecting a Mystery Science Theater movie in your mind

that that's coming so we'll talk about that at the end of the show but thank you everybody as always hmm for being here for mega64 mm hey I wanted it you brought up earlier the Adam Sandler actually no I'm sorry I want to say one more thing about child's play going back a child's play the real toys people yeah in the chat were talking about that Oh child's play has always been silly I mean look at the John Waters ones I didn't know John Waters ever did child's play I don't know I don't know anything about that at all anyone do you know about that you know okay yeah yeah I'd never heard about that I know Devine and Chucky I'm only familiar with the original child's play and a little bit two and three but I've sold the original one I had that honey like copied VHS tape oh really parents rented it from Blockbuster and then taped it everybody used to tape oh yeah I had that one on copied tape and I'd launch it all the time and it was like creepy I really liked it when I was a kid I was disappointed initially when like there was no Voodoo in this new one like nobody possessed Chuck and like I and the movie became really enjoyable it was a mom from seventh heaven the yeah she was in the first one first yeah in the first house really watch seven oh you weren't at seven yeah and then uh I think I watched that I definitely have seen the first one and then Bride of Chucky cuz Pam Anderson was in it yeah oh yeah I bribed she played the Bride of Chucky yeah Wow Pam Anderson missed out on yeah you're right you're absolutely right that's why I saw it anyway you brought up the Adam Sandler thing earlier yeah the the only reason that I know about that murder is a murder mystery though it was the only reason that I know about that is somebody put a video online of now Evangelion is on Netflix now oh yeah and somebody posted a video online of I think it was like end of evangelion like the ending of the whole thing it goes to the end and then it just immediately minimizes it into the corner while it shows a big ad for Adam Sandler's uh whatever really that was the recommended thing when it was over I thought that was so funny actually um I don't want to be the person to tell story about how I'm old but I'm going to we're all old John that's my mistake something happened that has never happened before while we were filming and I thought it was a funny story I'll tell real quick we were out in public we were filming something as we he's like oh hey um what you guys got no what are you doing what is this what you doing he was like 20-something yeah don't know leave me alone leave me the anyways usually answer yeah school project and he stops cuz school project you ain't no school project you old as hell hell no you ain't doing a school project what you doing and I said I yeah I'm the teacher Sean immediately got pissed off I dig it you got angry I give me it's cool you like but I said yeah yeah well I'm filming a video for my it's it's an architecture class that's what I did say that are you scared of way cuz he's like oh okay yeah I I didn't like that so anyways I was uh I'm glad you brought that up because I I thought that was a funny story you know yeah to me it was like a another chapter of my life honestly I'm surprised you went for that excuse I think I stopped using any long I know I feel like that excuse ran its course eight years ago did hey dad dad now you got but it's the easiest answer just knowing you about it was like what you get free cable from the cable company after a few months they go hold on a second wait a minute hold on like alright you got away with it longer than you should have the excuse that I use when people ask me what I'm doing I'm just I just I give the mote I've just only gotten more vague as I get older I just go for fun's fun oh that's good it's like what do you respond to that it's I'm just doing fun things hey what do you do yeah that's what I mean doing fun things you're good at the vague respond around the world too I just tell them the truth Wow YouTube video oh what's the channel mm-hmm mega64 cool I'm almost subscribe later and that's what they're looking for that's heater ax anyone yeah that's what they want to look this up but I didn't want to give this guy what he wanted that's the last thing I wanted to give him so anyways what video I was bringing up a Evangelion on Netflix notice how Shawn changed the subject tried that whole story that fake story was a smokescreen to cover up I use I it is now publicly available it that and I I honestly think yeah there's no other the only reason literally no other reason I can think of rock oh you were telling me that there's up Evangelion a lot of hosts um there's controversy about the new show yeah and so when it first went up when it first went up I was on the I was one of the rage ragers oh you rage was why I was because um they did not I mean everyone know at this point it's out there that they did not license fly me to the moon somebody to me I know the here's the thing the world of music licensing is incredibly tough complicated and tough and I mean like married with children had this iconic theme song and they couldn't get the rights do it ever again you know and there's all kinds of stuff that goes thanks to nachos a pricy man I guess so but it this this cover of the song has been I mean like anime distributors have put that out years and years ago like and it's in every other territory like Netflix in Japan oh hey guys that like yeah it's incredibly bizarre anyway so it was just that was defeated hearing that was just like man really uh it wasn't the I mean that pissed me off and it definitely in my eyes makes it like oh so this is not the definitive version but was it like life ending when it was just like the end credits like to me it's like I'm still gonna recommend people watch the show you know like that song at the credit that makes me but that really makes me sad but it's okay whatever but then but then it just didn't I've kept twisting it was like oh yeah there's an instrumental of that song during this really emotional scene later in the show yeah it's just like no music in that scene now there's crickets like so I would say that's the most upsetting part of it it's not like you can't watch it yeah but man that sucks now the rest of the stuff that I heard was oh you know people kept telling me oh they edited and censored the show and I'm like what and I'm looking into this and it's all just translation stuff and I feel like I'm the most um I get the most like upset over the littlest things when it comes to something I really love out the Star Wars blu-ray boxset and like oh they made Darth Vader yell no like just that one word I didn't buy that boxset yeah I don't I love this too when it comes to translation though like I don't feel that way all translation is interpretive like there's rue I mean I remember getting the uh I had the original Evangelion DVD boxset that came out the first ones that ever came out and then they released the Platinum box set which was like oh we cleaned it up we made it sound better we this that whatever and I remember a lot of the lines that I was used to in the original one didn't sound as cool in the new one but it was translation like it you know it's like that that nothing's ever one-to-one so to me I just feel like yeah it's all interpretive if you really want to know certain things in certain ways and have your own interpretation of them I would learn Japanese or you know talk with a lot of other people who have maybe interpreted in different ways and you decide how you think things should be that's I don't know that's how I felt about it I haven't seen anything in it that was like egregiously um I don't know to me there's a lot of interpretive stuff I think the thing that people were most upset about was um this line that has kind of almost become a meme in End of Evangelion Shinji I'm not gonna spoil the movie but angry ng does something bad he's not doing good stuff and and he song a double yeah yeah that yeah in the in the version of this movie that had only been available in America it was the only version available yeah they remember seeing that movie in a bootleg form years before that where it was he were they subtitle it as he's just like I'm the lowest of the low like I'm so like you know um that's how I remembered it and I remember when the when the American DVD came out it was like they yeah so to me that was so like I'm so wreaked of like man these would these edgy that's how I that's how I always felt so like the new Netflix thing goes back to I'm the lowest of the low it's a more direct translated line I'm not saying that line is better or that translation is better but I also don't de-facto thing too I don't I think people have gotten used to that being the line but I don't think that that's like the definitive thing I think its interpretive so I don't know didn't care about that personally I think it's great I think it's awesome that it's available in white release now I wish that song was in there but that's really the only easiest way to watch a show for most everyone who isn't yeah infatuated without Rouge Shinji relationship drama yeah I heard that that got toned back uh well upset from what I understand it's just that the last subtitled version of it use the word love a lot and the new one uses like a lot which I think in a very like black-and-white sense it is that seems like a totally different thing and I I I could see that when you're looking at the screenshots next to each other it does definitely seem that way like it well but I feel like there's a lot of like like the guy who translated this is talking about this online and it's all kind of again like how you interpret his words I don't feel like those scenes are any less valuable because of I don't know I mean to me all the all the intention and all the feeling of those scenes is still there I don't think the words are you know quite the literal words are quite as I don't know hey gonna do that tell my boys on Pride Month yeah I should have changed it next month I think I heard that the translation is all going through studio kara still as well that it's not like Netflix making these decisions with ver hired interpreter I I don't know how 100% this is but I heard that they're going through the interpretation that car is provided yeah from what I understand the original studio is like being super hands-on my translation yeah so I don't know so it's something to do with that I definitely think so I'm glad mean that's fine yeah that's fine I have that version that's fine but it is cool they're in HD on anyone who is already a hardcore insane Oh Ava fan yeah has the blu-ray rips on a hard drive we're just because they own them you know maybe it's different format a fax of a beautifully had you wouldn't be upset unless you were already obsessed with the show Yeah right it had memorized all the attempt billion I've seen it millions of times yeah and the fact that the show was released and within ten hours there was a list of criticisms people on the first night it singed 26 episodes and two to our movies who had a 15 hour binge session and they insane I just finished my 15 hour Netflix Netflix watching session and within within two hours people had like disavowed the whole show as someone who's been admittedly obsessed with it forever and constantly not just when it comes out on a new streaming service I was looking at this week as being all right social media is gonna be really already follow like a million Ava things on my yeah on my social media feeds yeah so now it's just constant and non-stop and I anticipated that but I'm so happy because like you know week or two no really I'm we talking myself you think I mean we're talking about it before Netflix I don't think this is gonna I feel like Netflix is gonna put something else out in another week and then change your thing yeah and then and that's gonna go back maybe maybe maybe a certain yeah maybe a certain Sena maybe week it's Evangelion but next week will be something else I am happy though now I should say I haven't listened to the new dubs I have no but don't watch even going dub day no watching Japanese don't but uh but I think in every way it's a better we get a better situation with the dub no matter how it sounds cuz they removed all the cartoony sound effects they added the last American dub of Evangelion added like splat sound effects too gunshots - like somebody gets shot in the head they add like a like fly war yeah seriously slide whistles and out sermons so yeah that's gone so that's good well elfin lead is still available on YouTube there you go there it is and it's prestige the arguably the better anime it's good one actually it's on Hulu so that was a deep cut way deeper series if you like Ava checkout elephant lead it's they improved upon the formula did you ever watch that oh I am somebody - maybe not didn't make me like yo check this out watch the first episode oh yeah I watched it this week and I was like you you watch it this week yeah oh really first first episode Wow okay so it's like Ava but better this it's like a better version of the major um sale themes but just better execute maybe maybe maybe all the anime nuts out there of which I am one that's not that's not a condemnation I am an anime nut as well however elfin lead always struck me as something that like that show always struck me and this is what I thought back in like high school I thought this is for I thought it looked like something for high schoolers that were like Hot Topic shirts like I laugh at you because you're all the same kind of like it was like all gone people would show me parts from it and it was like it's like bloody to the point of like it's gorefest have you seen it have you seen any of not really know so maybe seriously if that's a bad take on it you tell me cuz I didn't watch it this is what I thought and like night oh my god it's like / Josh for the first episode shahnameh okay I haven't know what you're even saying I don't know what this is I give it an elephant and I can't it can't be elephant lead the first episode starts with just a naked girl walking around killing killing I don't know a hundred people with her mind like just rip em in half didn't the guy who's hurt pop out yeah it's all later she's like making friends in a house like peeing on herself it's to be a human I spoiled it no I did you're still gonna love okay it's it's better than it's like Ava but better oh she's like the Ray character but a better version and now it's possible she's got cool little cooler berets than the Ava kids we're way cooler little little hair piece but he pisses on themselves and a mother and then she if that was the right dub or not I think I think what did it because I understand what a lot of people are saying I'm so popular line so to change it now is almost like what why are you do I get that I do get that but I think my problem is that it or it was so the intent of it was to be edgy in the first place you know what I mean it'd be like if they if if somebody recut Star Wars became famous I I still wouldn't to keep that later right I'd be right yeah no that was for like kind of the wrong reasons you know I mean it fit like the release the the sign of the times was like 90s sci-fi channel anime dubs ultimately to just come out they were trying to compete with it yeah be edgy that's a bad analogy that's okay hey I'm just glad that it's easier to access for most yeah always been interesting over all this it's good I'm glad that it's that this happened so yeah I'm still but I still I haven't had a lot of time to watch it yeah you've already seen it I think it you you got the gist there was I was in the middle of watching Joe Joe I finally was doing that but I I haven't had time to go back I was watching attack on Titan that's had a new season that's been great so I have been watching some anime that I just have yet to read to revisit Ava I'm like not mentally there right now but maybe this summer that's that's a wise choice if you're not mentally there it's such a mental show you got a prepare yourself get a good night's sleep before you watch Evangelion you can't be sitting in the movie theater asking what's going on it's not a bad animate just a really weird one I'm Rocco your anime critic for nerds that's why I play video games yo I got a new video game this week came out just last Thursday it's called my friend Pedro it's available for download I got it on the switch it's an indie game I've heard about this it just got released on Thursday I actually had it in my calendar what I was looking forward to what kind of game is it because the name is so unique it is a platformer game where you are basically a dual wielding backflipping bullet time yielding and I don't know if you're a hit man or what but it's pretty fun it's like it's just an over-the-top game you can be riding a skateboard on it and like kickflip it's a platformer so you just go from left to right shooting dudes trying to shoot try to make your way through the level killing guys but you can go into bullet time and like you can like ride a skateboard kickflip on it and like kick the skateboard into people's faces you know you can there's like different mechanics where you can like kick things that people will shoot them like gas tanks make them explode but it's all about like doing cool slow-motion acrobatics and killing people it kind of reminds me of super hot meets hotline Miami oh cool meets Max Payne a little bit I guess it's pretty fun it's you know it's $20 or less depending on if you get it on sale it's brand-new ok I say two thumbs up check out my friend Pedro it's fun I was playing actually a game that I brought up before but now we have like that we actually can talk about it now the judgment on ps4 right is you know by the Yakuza team they made this and I've been having a lot of fun with that I mean it's that genre of game but you're from the detective side and your sleuthing around and you're using drones to spy on people and your you know everything about it is in that kind of like right on the perfect line of serious and hilarious goofy saygus oh god they nail it hey those games are those games are like my new comfort food the Yakuza games are just like I could just play those all the time a lot of times I'll kind of skip each like every other one just to kind of like give myself some time between them but judgment is hitting at just the right time where it's been a while since I played like six yeah and I'm just off this is great so yeah anyway just been having fun I also picked up a couple games that I think we should play on friend dimension okay good co-op games one of them was called one strike which is basically like divekick meets Bushido blade it is a it is a side-scrolling fighting game one hit kills and you are you know samurais you could be an Oni there's probably like eight characters classes or whatever yeah okay well eight different fighters they all have their their weapon of choice and their style of fighting that is unique to them but you just kind of go back and forth you can attack you can block you can dash forward or back that's it first person to land a hit wins it's called one strike I got it for $0.99 it's pretty fun you know if you like dive kick I think you would like one strike it's basically the same mechanic yeah you know just land the hit and win I haven't heard anyone mentioned dive kick in yeah it's been a while well I feel like the premise of that game is interesting for a second yes I beat portal 2 with the kids and then I was like you know what I've never played the portal co-op ever do it I still you know what I've done that like four times yeah you need the right person to play with yeah we started getting frustrated with each other and I turned it off and I was like with each other yeah I was like man I go over there Emma no no no yeah god I cried okay wait we guys and so I was like you know what put the controllers down oh when we put in horizon zero dawn and their play that before and we're starting that easily if one person understands how to beat the puzzle and the other person doesn't it's game over like it is just time it right you didn't time it right all right get on that platform know get get on the planet just it yeah yeah I got a minute I've become like Zen master cuz every time I've played through that multiplayer campaign it's always with a significant other so it's like okay I'm gonna be very patient work together and a builder relay it was cuz it's four portals it's four different options to control and there's a lot of timing jumps a lot of them I was just gonna say I mean we need to clarify what happened when portal 2 came out portal 2 was released when the PlayStation hack happened the online hack or whatever I yeah and I remember being excited I played the single-player and I was so excited to play the core the co-op thing but then all that network should happen I was like I'm not touching my ps3 and then that came and went and other games came out so I never touched that and I feel like a lot of people who got that game on ps3 yeah that's me more people I know who have played that co-op typically they got it on 360 and not that's what I've encountered maybe among Atlas and p-body they're just wait there for you dude well it is fun it is years from now you got your like the first stage right yeah in like the standard sorry okay yeah into chapter 2 and maybe chapter 3 and 4 or where it's like when it gets down to timing puzzles yeah and we did a couple of those a couple and then by it was one and we were seriously an hour and we haven't solved anything it's like hey guys and watched a youtube video before where it's like alright we're getting real frustrated let's just do a little cheating here yeah and then the last game I picked up this week which I really want to play on friend dimension with everybody is a game called crawl it's a dungeon crawler okay one person is the hero everybody else controls the monsters if the monster if you are the monster who kills the hero you switch places you like steal their soul and then you're the hero and the hero becomes a monster and the first person to level up and unlock a boss battle and beat the main boss and escape the dungeon wins and the main boss can also be is also controlled by the people so it's really fun you are either leveling up your hero or you're leveling up your monsters but either way you're all getting stronger and I really like it so it's all is this on switch to or is available on switch yeah switch min switch is a great place for all these indie game they found their thing with that it's funny because I remember when the 360 came out exactly that was like the big kind of marketplace for like on in terms of console like hey indie games are here oh wow okay and it's funny how Microsoft kind of let that go I feel like a little bit but meanwhile Nintendo who when the when the Wii was out it was like yeah good luck in an indie game on this thing how ubiquitous that platform was but it was kind of hard to get on the eStore or whatever they shop yeah from what I remember but uh the switch has just been this great place for all that stuff like it's really awesome like I pick up small little games on there all the time and it's great I was just yesterday playing that death coming game that you promoted on the show a couple weeks ago that's fine still having fun with that a lot of good India's yeah it's really dope oh I should say actually um speaking of switch I finally beat Final Fantasy 9 I was replaying that and again they their port they ported that to switch to they ported like all the Final Fantasies almost I guess not the Super Nintendo and below but everything else has been ported to switch and it's been awesome um but anyway I finally I wanted to I wanted to play through Final Fantasy 9 again I hadn't done it since it came out in 2008 whatever year that was and I always had kind of a sour opinion of it I was always kind of that you know a lot of people told me it was their favorite one and I'm like what the hell what are you talking about like I just had not a lot of positive memories of it and I played it again and I I didn't so much want to change my own opinion of it as much as I wanted to understand what people telling me you know like yeah I just didn't have good memories of it now that I've played it again I understand where people are coming from my opinion of it hasn't really changed a lot I did enjoy playing it I don't put it anywhere on the level of like seven or eight or even the Super Nintendo ones but though those games kind of had a story with a real you know what I mean they really have these highs and lows photo fantasy nine doesn't really have that it's the most kind of like comfort food RPG I've ever played but in that I see why people like it it really feels it's such a comfortable game to play you know what I mean it's very it's not high stakes like the other ones are like it definitely takes a sci-fi turn at the end and it's cool but it's really just at the end and that's why I realized that that's why I didn't stick with me throughout it just kind of drops it at the end which is cool it was that that was fine I had fun playing it it's not my favorite but I see what people like about it and it does seeing all the characters kind of become a family in it is a really rewarding aspect of that game so I enjoyed it you know ten is another one that I never really loved but at least the gameplay was a lot of fun and and and you know kind of same thing with 12 9s gameplay was a little bit is a little bit dry I don't really love it but it was fun to play I enjoyed it and now I've moved on I'm going to replay 12 now because that's on switch 2 and that was a game that didn't care about the story or the characters maybe a little bit but the gameplay was so fun in that game and so different than any other Final Fantasy game so I'm excited to revisit that so that's what I'm doing now and that in judgment are pretty much what I'm playing now yeah so yeah oh speaking of video games blood stain came out yeah we need to talk about this we do we were famously responsible for blood stain getting fund raising a million dollars and yeah one day we were part of the fund raiser program as a reward bloodstained said hey mega64 you guys are cool you wanna have a little easter egg in the videogame yes we said yes and without telling anybody we devised this whole secret Easter Egg that we were going to announce yes and I guess now is the time to announce it yeah yeah we planned this whole kind of hunt for people to go on to discover the means from which to unlock this hidden item in blood-stained which is so cool which is a huge honor the Creator I mean the you know the guy responsible for all of these games that we love it's Symphony of the Night and Castlevania all this stuff to say that we'll put it a mega 64 item and the game is incredible so yeah we have this whole game plan figured out however the day the game came out somebody already figured out what the password was to unlock it and yeah that was within hours it was we're gonna send everybody on this hunt yeah it's the name of Omega 64 character from one of our videos yeah good luck the hunt is on and we're really over we're gonna see it right yeah poring through every video what could it be could it be this could be Teddy beams could be Thomas chips names from so many classic characters Christopher demon Aaron Jimmy Chow what's it gonna be yeah somebody looked at the source code and found it a new to us we've never really been part of a major release like this so I didn't think that would happen but it did um so but I don't think we should say it you don't want to our whole subreddit already knows reddit nerd yeah well I guess now they know where to find it but first for those of you out there who didn't know some subreddit it was posted but if you want to play the game legitimate ban ban random Ortiz jr. he's been the nicest guy and still right now respond no anyway but yeah the item I'm going to talk about the item that you get it's an item in the game know there there's an actual mega64 helmet in the game that the character can wear which is so fun I have not please you I haven't I haven't used it I haven't seen it in game yet they sent me the asset like an image of it and like the day the game came out that was the first time I had seen it so it looks like yeah I mean they asked for pictures we sent them reference photos of the helmet and all that stuff and it looks like it's in there it looks like they did it they updated it to we you know we said it's a bicycle helmet oh great painted silver they made it a modern bicycle helmet with the you know with the brim it kind of looks like a hard hat yeah brand but yes still a bicycle helmet with wires coming out of it so yeah that in 2003 don't have you ever thought I'd be in a video game yeah really does they give you like a boost when you equip it I haven't played the game yet I haven't either oh God probably not asking the wrong guy this should make you more handsome yeah base yeah um it makes you funnier but eyetality it's plus two colors gamma D every while a character will laugh instead of attacking here Oh ho-ho let's do comedy it's funny cuz in the chat again somebody said what the code was and then when they said the name everyone's just going well what video is that from that can be the new scavenger hunt video what video is the name from we're not gonna tell you yeah see you now that's the new scavenger hunt the and the first person who can email me with what that is from podcast at mega64 calm we will send you a prize oh it's my subreddit the entire youtube backlog plus five defense somebody already got it well they got to email me that guy didn't you getting anything I got it see in my inbox but anyway yeah so that anyway thank you to the team behind blood-stained for including us on that that was really cool and I can't wait to play it I'm I have a hopefully I'm gonna get a code for that on switch or I'm gonna be playing that on there soon but anyway that was really really cool to be asked about that we reposted the Vampire Hunter video that we did with eage this past week or whatever reposted it on like Twitter and stuff and that video was like a real I felt like I think I've said this before it was kind of a blur for me because we filmed that right after we did the Nintendo World Champion yeah yeah the 2015 Nintendo e3 presentation and I was so tired from that that I remember we landed in San Francisco and I was like oh yeah like we're going right into this and and I remember at some point somebody asked me like so what are we shooting first and I was like I I don't know I have no idea like we're like we were gonna hunt vampires with Egan and that was it you know so he came to our hotel and we just filmed around hooked and I just remember thinking like what is going on right now but I think it definitely shows in the video that was a very strange video it it may have rubbed off but anyway that's all yeah security was also chasing us around that hotel yeah like they didn't want us to be filming so yeah yeah we were sneaking we were stealing our shots yeah guerilla filmmaking style at its finest yeah and it's hard when Kevin's dressed up like a vampire yeah and you got a big camera they know what's gonna happen big dressed up was later at their studio okay that was separate shot yeah um but it was funny because anytime that they talked to us like we've been through that so many times that we know how to kind of navigate the situation so the security when they came to us they were like you know why are you filming in this room he can't be filming in this room he can't be film in this hallway whatever we we uh you know we were just butter you know we were just like oh okay oh we didn't know well we'll go over the you know what I mean it's like just just you know take care of the situation okay yeah we're sorry about that we didn't know well we'll go and then you know we just film in the stairway next to it you know whatever that's how we navigate it the translator that EAGA had at that time was like totally the other situation all right pal turn around and walked that way okay it was really funny it was like you know hey we'll wrap the shot up soon okay you did that way we were just like no it's okay it's okay it was pretty funny he was flexing yeah uh maybe we should wrap this up because you had some stuff to work on yes we do we have some stuff we want to work on uh listen everybody this Thursday is our first live show in Los Angeles make 64 last laugh yeah it sold out that one sold out but we have a second show on Sunday June 30th at Tara Grand Ballroom and you can there's still some tickets for that mega64 dot-com / tour that's still available right now and of course in November will be doing mega 60 board game days in Anaheim tickets for that are still available yeah tickets for that available at mega64 TOCOM slash game days so check those out I thought we would take a minute to talk about we're going to the some the all the cons that we're going to this summer we're doing Anime Expo we're doing our TX but we're also um we're also doing a San Diego comic-con we'll talk about

 object in the sky. Bright, silvery, with tantalizing features on its face, it’s been the
 target of imagination, poetry, science, and even the occasional rocket. If you pay even the most cursory attention
 to it, you’ll see that it changes every day; sometimes it’s up in the day, sometimes
 at night, and its shape is always changing. What causes this behavior? The Moon is basically a giant ball of rock
 3500 kilometers across hanging in space. Its surface is actually pretty dark, with about
 the same reflectivity as a chalkboard or asphalt. However, it looks bright to us because it’s
 sitting in full sunlight; the Sun illuminates it, and it reflects that light down to us
 here on Earth. And because it’s a sphere, and orbiting
 the Earth, the way we see it lit by the Sun changes with time. That’s what causes its
 phases: geometry. The important thing to remember through all
 this is, because the Moon is a ball and in space, half of it is always illuminated by
 the Sun! This is true for the Earth, too, and every
 spherical object in space; half faces the Sun, half faces away. We call the part facing
 the Sun the daylight or bright side, and the half facing away the night or dark side. The phase of the Moon refers to what shape
 the Moon appears to us; how much of it we see illuminated from the Earth. The key to
 all this is this line, dividing the lit day side from the unlit night side. We call that
 line the terminator. If you’re facing the moon, with the sun
 behind you, you’re seeing the half of the moon that is fully illuminated by sunlight
 and it looks full. If you’re off to the side you see half of the lit side and half
 of the dark side and we say the moon is half full. If the sun is on the other side of the
 moon, you’re look at the unlit half, and it looks dark. Now, mind you, I haven’t
 moved anything except our point of view here, so at all times the Moon is always half lit,
 and half dark. Remember that. The phase of the Moon we see depends on from
 what direction the sunlight’s hitting it, and the angle we see that from Earth. The Moon orbits the Earth roughly once per
 month. In fact, that’s where the word “month” comes from; “month” and “Moon” are
 cognates, words that have similar etymological histories, and in most languages, including
 English, the two words are very similar. The length of time we call the month is derived
 from the length of time it takes the Moon to go through all its phases -- 29.5 days. So. To describe the phases, let’s start
 at the beginning: New Moon. New Moon happens when the Sun, Moon, and Earth
 are all more or less in a line. The Moon’s orbit is actually tipped a bit to the Earth’s,
 so sometimes new Moon happens when the Moon is “below” the Sun, or “above” it.
 But at some point in its orbit, at some point in the month, it appears to be as close to
 the Sun as it can. What does this look like from Earth? The Moon is between the Earth and the Sun,
 so from our perspective we only see the dark half, the unilluminated half, of the Moon.
 The other side, the far side, of the Moon is lit, but we can’t see it. It makes sense
 then to call this the beginning of the Moon’s cycle, hence the term “New Moon”. Now think about this for a sec: Because the
 Moon is near the Sun in the sky, it travels across the sky with the Sun. It’s up during
 the day! You can only see it from the part of the Earth that’s lit, which is when it’s
 daytime. It’s a very common misconception that the Moon is only up at night, but it’s
 up during the day literally just as often. At New Moon, the Moon stays near the Sun,
 so it rises at sunrise, and sets at sunset. This makes it extremely difficult to see;
 it is, after all, sitting next to the brightest object in the sky, and only a little bit of
 it is lit from our perspective. But not for long. Because the Moon is orbiting
 the Earth, after a couple of days it’s moved a bit to the east. Now we’re seeing it along
 a slight angle, and we can see a little bit of the illuminated half of the Moon on its
 side toward the Sun. The terminator, the day/night line, appears
 curved around the Moon, so what we see is a thin illuminated crescent Moon. At this
 point the crescent is still very thin, with the horns of the crescent pointing away from
 the Sun. Note that the Moon is still pretty close to
 the Sun in the sky, just a bit to the east, rising maybe an hour or two after sunrise.
 But this means it’s up all day, and then sets after the Sun does. This is the best
 time to see the crescent Moon, when the Sun has already set and the sky starts to get
 dark. The Moon will be low over the western horizon, and it will set soon after the Sun
 does. Let’s wait a couple of days. OK, now the Moon has moved a bit more in its
 orbit around the Earth, and is farther from the Sun in the sky. We see a little more of
 the illuminated part, and the crescent is wider. Since it’s getting thicker, we say
 this is a “waxing crescent” Moon; waxing means growing or getting bigger. It’s also
 well away from the Sun now, so it’s easier to spot, even during the day before sunset. Seven or so days after new Moon we get to
 our first milestone: the Moon is now one-quarter of the way around its orbit. It’s 90° away
 from the Sun in the sky, which means we’re looking straight down on the terminator, the
 Moon’s day/night line. It cuts right down the middle of the visible face of the Moon,
 so it’s half lit, with the sunward side of the Moon visible and the other side dark. Confusingly, this phase is properly named
 “first quarter” because the Moon is ¼ of the way through its cycle, ¼ of the way
 through its orbit around the Earth, even though it looks half full. So it’s not really the
 half-full moon -- astronomers prefer “first quarter,” so if you want to sound all astronomery,
 then you should call it that. But time marches on. The Moon continues on
 its gravitational dance with Earth, swinging around its orbit. Now more than half full,
 we say its shape is “gibbous”, which means swollen or convex. Since it’s getting wider,
 this is actually the waxing gibbous phase of the Moon. It rises in the late afternoon,
 and is up most of the night. Our next big step comes two weeks after new
 Moon, when it’s moved halfway through its orbit. It is now opposite the Sun in the sky,
 180° around. The Earth is between the Moon and Sun, so we’re looking at the fully-illuminated
 half of the Moon. This is the full Moon. Because it’s opposite the Sun, it rises
 at sunset and sets and sunrise; it’s up all night shining down on the Earth. But again, wait a couple of days and things
 change. When the Moon is full it’s 180° around the sky from the Sun, so as it continues
 to move around the Earth in a circle the distance between it and the Sun is now starting to
 decrease, even as it continues on in the same direction. As before, it keeps rising and
 setting later, but now it rises after sunset, and sets after sunrise. If you get up early
 in the morning as the Sun is just rising in the east, you’ll see the nearly-but-not-quite
 full Moon setting in the west. Not only that, but we’re about to go through
 all the phases again, but in reverse order. A few days after full Moon the lit side is
 shrinking. It’s in the waning, or shrinking, gibbous phase. Then, three weeks or so after new Moon, and
 a week after full, the Moon is once again half lit, the terminator splitting the Moon’s
 face in two even halves. This is the “third quarter” Moon, because the Moon is ¾ of
 the way through its cycle. It’s a lot like the first quarter, but the side that was lit
 is now dark, and vice versa. It’s 270° around the sky from the Sun. It rises at midnight
 and sets at noon. A few days later and the Moon is a crescent
 again, getting thinner. It’s now a “waning crescent.” It rises just a couple of hours
 before sunrise, and sets a couple of hours before sunset. Then, finally, we’re back where we started.
 One month after new Moon, the Moon has traveled 360° around the sky, and is once again as
 close to the Sun as it can get. It’s new Moon, and the cycle starts up again as it
 has for time immemorial. An interesting thing happens if you move your
 perspective from the Earth to the Moon. The phases of the Moon we see from Earth depend
 on the angle of the Moon and Sun in the sky. But on the Moon, the angles are exactly 180°
 reversed; at new Moon, when the Moon is between the Earth and Sun, the Earth
 is opposite the Sun as seen from the Moon. It’s full Earth! All the other phases are opposite too, so
 when we see a full Moon, a Moon-dweller would see a new Earth, and so on. Have you ever looked at the thin crescent
 Moon and seen the ghostly face of the rest of the unlit side? That’s because it’s
 not really unlit: the nearly full Earth is reflecting sunlight on the Moon, lighting
 up the otherwise dark part. The Earth is bigger and more reflective than
 the Moon, so it’s actually 50 times brighter than a full Moon! This glow is called Earthshine,
 a term I quite like. Even more poetically, it’s been called “the old Moon in the
 new Moon’s arms”, referring to the unlit part surrounded by the crescent new Moon’s
 horns. That’s lovely, isn’t it? The Moon is one of the most beautiful and
 most gratifying objects in the sky to observe. It’s different every day! Yet it’s also
 the same, because we see, more or less, the same half of it, the same face all the time.
 It’s big and bright, and the features on its surface discernible by eye (and even better
 with binoculars or a small telescope). As the phases change, inexorably, day after
 day, the angle of sunlight hitting the surface changes, bringing new things into our view.
 The motions become comforting, even familiar. It’s a reminder that the Universe may seem
 strange and complicated and forbidding at first, but over time, as you get outside and
 experience it, it becomes your neighborhood. Welcome home. Today you learned why the Moon has phases:
 It’s a sphere, and it orbits the Earth, so the angle at which we see its lit side
 changes. It goes from new, to waxing crescent, to half full, waxing gibbous, full, waning
 gibbous, half full, waning crescent, and then the cycle starts all over again. This also
 affects when it rises and sets, and what we see on the surface. Crash Course is produced in association with

moonlanding,"Inside a locked vault at Johnson Space Center is treasure few have seen and fewer have touched.

The restricted lab is home to hundreds of pounds of moon rocks collected by Apollo astronauts close to a half-century ago. And for the first time in decades, NASA is about to open some of the pristine samples and let geologists take a crack at them with 21st-century technology.

What better way to mark this summer’s 50th anniversary of humanity’s first footsteps on the moon than by sharing a bit of the lunar loot.

“It’s sort of a coincidence that we’re opening them in the year of the anniversary,” explained NASA’s Apollo sample curator Ryan Zeigler, covered head to toe in a white protective suit with matching fabric boots, gloves and hat.

“But certainly the anniversary increased the awareness and the fact that we’re going back to the moon.”

With the golden anniversary of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s feat fast approaching — their lunar module Eagle landed July 20, 1969, on the Sea of Tranquility — the moon is red-hot again.

After decades of flip-flopping between the moon and Mars as the next big astronaut destination, NASA aims to put astronauts on the lunar surface again by 2024 at the White House’s direction. President Donald Trump prefers talking up Mars. But the consensus is that the moon is a crucial proving ground given its relative proximity to home — 240,000 miles (386,000 kilometers) or two to three days away.

Zeigler’s job is to preserve what the 12 moonwalkers brought back from 1969 through 1972 — lunar samples totaling 842 pounds (382 kilograms) — and ensure scientists get the best possible samples for study.

Some of the soil and bits of rock were vacuum-packed on the moon — and never exposed to Earth’s atmosphere — or frozen or stored in gaseous helium following splashdown and then left untouched. The lab’s staff is now trying to figure out how best to remove the samples from their tubes and other containers without contaminating or spoiling anything. They’re practicing with mock-up equipment and pretend lunar dirt.

Compared with Apollo-era tech, today’s science instruments are much more sensitive, Zeigler noted.

“We can do more with a milligram than we could do with a gram back then. So it was really good planning on their part to wait,” he said.

The lunar sample lab has two side-by-side vaults: one for rocks still in straight-from-the-moon condition and a smaller vault for samples previously loaned out for study. About 70 percent of the original haul is in the pristine sample vault, which has two combinations and takes two people to unlock. About 15 percent is in safekeeping at White Sands in New Mexico. The rest is used for research or display.

Of the six manned moon landings, Apollo 11 yielded the fewest lunar samples: 48 pounds or 22 kilograms. It was the first landing by astronauts and NASA wanted to minimize their on-the-moon time and risk. What’s left from this mission — about three-quarters after scientific study, public displays and goodwill gifts to all countries and U.S. states in 1969 — is kept mostly here at room temperature.

moonlanding,"Almost 50 years since man first walked on the lunar surface, the head of the European Space Agency explains his vision for living and working on the Moon.

Johann-Dietrich Woerner believes the next giant leap for humankind could be an international collaboration of space faring nations in the form of a Moon village. This village would be a permanent lunar base for science, business, tourism or even mining.

Woerner explains how using the Moon’s own natural resources could help build and sustain a base by 3D printing a structure or building element. Robotic rovers could inflate protective domes for astronauts. He also discusses the potential hazards of living on the Moon as well as the possible locations of he lunar base and the advantages of a new global space project.",Moon Village,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amYK5voqLSk,0,270254,2216,86,207,amYK5voqLSk,you living and working on the moon may sound like science fiction but the head of the European Space Agency wants to make this ambitious idea a reality a permanent lunar base or as he calls it a moon village but unlike any village you might find on earth in a more villages of different spacefaring nations be it robotic or being a human to look also for different activities be it pure science B's OB daughter business even tourism or mining or whatever to put them together on the same place and this is the idea of the Moon Village it's been almost 50 years since man first walked on the lunar surface and the end of the Apollo program but now for many people a permanent basis the next logical step following the cooperation of countries from all over the world for the International Space Station one key thought is to use the moon's own natural resources to build and sustain a base it's water ice metals and minerals using its own materials to 3d print a structure or building element a rover could land on the surface inflate a dome and the roads could begin to construct a building to protect the astronauts and while a moon village is a big project it can start small the advantage of the idea of moon village is that we don't need a big amount of funding at the beginning we don't have to define everything and just to say okay we build a big structure the idea is that the different actors the different players worldwide they look in their special capabilities in their special interest and they bring just their part into the idea that means we can start with a small lending mission which many countries are already planning up to a huge investment for instance for some telescope radio telescope on the far side of the Moon so it's it's a multiple users by multiple users but a single place but there are hazards to consider such as solar and cosmic radiation micro meteorites and extreme temperatures and so the Easter director-general believes that areas near the poles are in constant daylight would be the most suitable on the far side of the Moon we have places on moon which are at least especially at the South Pole which has permanent darkness where we can find water and we know from some missions that there is water water is a good source to produce hydrogen and oxygen and also to go into the shadow of the moon we will have places where we are we don't have the radiation coming from the earth so building a telescope over there by using the material we find on the moon so not bringing all the stuff on mirrors that could also open new possibilities to look deep into our universe the idea is that the moon base would be a global project a natural new step emulating how the International Space Station works we have more than 60 spacefaring nations around our world and the Americans are now saying journey to Mars and I totally agree that it's right humans will go to Mars at one day but this is a little bit far away in the future so also the Americans are interested in the moon so it will be the Americans it will be the Russians it will be the Chinese it will be the Indians the Japanese and even more countries with smaller contributions so my hope is that we will really have a really global exploration scheme on the moon the head of ESA's commitment to a moon village sends a powerful message although it could be 20 years before the technology is ready to make it happen but as more nations plan to return to the moon the need for a permanent base will grow and Europe could be at the heart of the next giant leap for humankind

But while the moon has remained largely unchanged during human history, our own understanding of it has evolved dramatically. Thanks to new observations, we now have not only unprecedented views of its surface, but a whole new tour of the moon that shows how both it and other rocky planets in our solar system have been shaped over billions of years. We'll start with one of the largest impacts--Orientale Basin, a feature that's as wide as the distance from New York City to Cincinnati. Using new elevation measurements, we can clearly see the effects of what is likely the last giant impact event in lunar history, with its outer mountain rings rising many kilometers above the lowest points inside the crater. The interiors of some craters in the moon's polar regions, like Shackleton, haven't seen sunlight in over two billion years. However, new measurements have created our best-yet maps of these types of craters, allowing us to see deep into the shadows of this surprisingly young-looking impact crater in the south that's more than twice as deep as the Grand Canyon. Some impacts are invisible for other reasons. Although the ancient South Pole-Aitken Basin is difficult to see from orbit because it is so large, new LRO topography maps reveal the largest impact basin in the Earth- moon system, measuring several kilometers in depth and around 2500 kilometers in diameter. Only the Hellas basin on Mars rivals it in size. One of the youngest large-scale impacts on the moon is the Tycho Crater. This fresh crater may have formed only 108 million years ago--when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. We now also have an extreme close-up view of the crater's central peak--revealing a mountain with sharp edges, building-sized rocks, and a central boulder about the size of a baseball stadium. Narrator: The Aristarchus Plateau is another recent lunar formation that has long interested scientists and astronomers. The crater itself formed in the same era as the Tycho Crater, and what appear to be snaking river valleys were actually carved by ancient lava flows. Narrator: Next, we arrive at Mare Serenitatis on the near side of the moon. In December of 1972, the crew of Apollo 17 landed in the Taurus Littrow valley, marking the last time humans have visited the surface of the moon. With images from LRO's narrow-angle camera, we can clearly see the evidence of that visit. In this image, you can easily see the base of the lunar lander, along with the lunar rover, parked far from the blast-off zone. You can also clearly see the astronaut trails and the wheeltracks left on the lunar surface. Narrator: We now head to the far side of the moon--which cannot be seen from Earth. Our first stop is the Compton-Belkovich region, which shows evidence for young volcanic activity in the farside highlands. This feature is unique not only because it is isolated from other volcanoes in the area, but also because it is located nowhere near the maria, where volcanoes are usually found. Also, on the far side, we find the Jackson Crater--which like the Tycho Crater on the near side, has an extensive and complex ray system. In fact, this crater is often considered to be like a twin to Tycho. Finally, the Tsiolkovsky Crater stands out as an excellent example of a farside crater filled with a sea of ancient lava--known as a mare. It is particularly interesting to scientists and other observers because of its isolation from other similar craters--as well as its beautiful central peak. As we continue to study the moon, our understanding of it improves, giving us new insights not only into how it has evolved over time, but also how other rocky planets in our solar system have come to look the way they do. With new missions, new instruments, and new technologies, we will continue to improve our knowledge of the moon... ...and better understand the history of our solar system."

Later on this Friday, President Moon will take part in a leaders' session... where the member states will discuss the global economy and international trade.
He will also hold talks with a handful of his global counterparts, including a crunch meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a key player in efforts to denuclearize North Korea.
Our Park Hee-jun reports from Osaka.
On the opening day of the G20 Osaka Summit on Friday,... President Moon Jae-in will engage in economic discussions... focused on addressing the global uncertainties brought about by the U.S.-China trade conflict.
A session will be held on the global economy, trade, and investment,... one of the four themes of the 14th G20 meeting.
President Moon is expected to share his government's fiscal policies,... including his push for a supplementary budget bill.
He is also expected to call for joint diplomatic efforts among the G20 nations,... in addressing global economic issues, including trade tensions.
With the G20 being one of the first bodies to take action,... in combating the global financial crisis in 2008,... active discussions will be held to prevent such a meltdown from happening again.

President Moon will also be occupied with a scheduled summit with Indonesia,... and pull-aside talks with India and the Netherlands.
But attention mainly focuses on President Moon meeting a key player in the North Korea denuclearization talks Russia.
This is perhaps the most important discussion of the day,... in terms of furthering his peace drive on the Korean Peninsula.
President Moon is expected to learn of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's thoughts from Kim's bilateral summit with Vladimir Putin in April,... and ask for Russia's continued support for his peace drive on the Korean Peninsula.

""And besides the series of meetings,... there's the question of whether President Moon will be able to hold talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. President Moon made it clear that he's willing to meet... to resolve the forced labor dispute between the two countries. He’s open to a last-minute meeting,... but this appears to depend entirely on Japan.

 one more time. Why do you think
 the moon landing was faked? We're both skeptics, right?
   So think about it skeptically. There's no way NASA
  had the technology to go to the moon. They just filmed it
  on a sound stage, that would've been
   way easier. Yeah, that's what
 conspiracy theorists think. But the truth is faking
 the moon landing in 1969 actually would have been harder than just going to the moon
 in the first place. Here, I'll show you. Fake Moon Landing, take one. All right, in this scene
   you're on the moon and it's real
 and we're fooling America
    and we're fooling America    and we're fooling America and action! See?
    Stanley Kubrick just shot a guy jumping around on set and then they played it
  back on TV. Sorry, but given
 the filmmaking and lighting technology
 at the time, that actually wouldn't
 have been possible. Right, the lighting. Look at how bright it is. Look at these shadows. This was clearly shot
 in a studio. (lights powering on) (man)
   Actually... creating that lighting
  would've been essentially impossible
  in a studio. Melinda, meet Mark Schubin. He's a forensic
 motion picture analyst and an Emmy-winning
 light fellow of the Society of Motion Picture
 and Television Engineers. Thanks, Adam.
 Using image forensics, I can tell you that
    the light source we see in the moon footage
   is actually parallel sun rays
   with no diffusion. If you look at the photos
    from the Apollo mission, you can see that
 all the shadows are parallel
  all the shadows are parallel  all the shadows are parallel because the light source is
 93 million miles away. (Adam)
 But if you try to recreate
 that same photo
   But if you try to recreate
 that same photo   But if you try to recreate that same photo using studio lighting,
  the shadows diverge. Huh...
 Back in the '60s,
    Back in the '60s,    Back in the '60s, the only way to recreate
 that effect would be
  that effect would be  that effect would be of laser lights to build a wall of millions
 of laser lights
 of laser lights so close together,
 they'd be like
 they'd be like they'd be like pixels on a TV screen. No, no, no, no, no! This lighting is all wrong! I need lasers, Peter! Lasers! But lasers back then
  were big and costly, so rigging together
 that many of that size would've required
  an enormous apparatus that probably would've cost more
  than the entire Apollo project. Perfect! This is great! Now we just need
    millions of these lasers. Oh, uh, I don't know
   if that's in our budget... Or the country's. Honestly, Peter... you make me furious.   And in those days, (Mark)
 And in those days,
   And in those days, the only lasers that were
 practically available were red. Which means that color photos
 we have from the moon landing would have been impossible. I can't shoot in red light! It makes this moon
 look like a bordello! Correction!
 We need millions of ultra rare,
    multi-colored lasers. How do I explain... I mean,
   that's not even a remotel-- (high-pitched voice)
 ""How do I explain...
  Even a remotely..."" Go back to film school, Peter! Now today, we could recreate the correct lighting
 with computer graphics. But in 1969,
 those didn't exist.
   Hmm.
   Hmm.   Hmm. I've asked my colleagues
 in forensics and in movie production and
 given the parallel light rays and the detailed color photos,
 we just cannot think of any way they could've faked
 the moon landing with the technology
 they had at the time. Hmm...
 Thanks, Mark.
  Thanks, Mark.  Thanks, Mark. Convinced? Maybe that's what
 they want you to think. What if NASA secretly
 created computer graphics and just kept it
 from us for 40 years? Well, then an astronomical
   number of people would've had to
    keep that secret. Like over 400,000
    NASA employees... You want all 400,000 of us
   to keep our mouths shut? Yes, please.
 Good luck.
 We love gossip.
 Good luck.
 We love gossip. Good luck.
 We love gossip. (Adam)
 ... Scientists from Australia,
    Spain and England
    Spain and England    Spain and England who said they
 independently picked up the moon landing
   transmission from space... And why would we
 lie for you? You're always making fun
 of our Vegemite. (Adam)
  ... And the Russians,
  our Space Race rivals who had every reason
   to prove us wrong. It's been 50 years,
  and we haven't even claimed that you faked it. You beat us
   fair and square this time. But we'll get you back...
  (snickering) in 2016! But where's the tangible proof
 that we went to the moon, huh? There isn't any.
 Actually, there is.
 Actually, there is. Actually, there is. While the astronauts
 were on the moon, they laid out
 a reflective material called retro reflectors. So today,
  when an observatory on Earth aims a high-powered laser
    at them, it bounces right back. Cut! Cut! Shut it down! This is impossible! Oh, no, no, no! Wait! It still could have
   been faked. All you'd have to do is
    secretly develop computer graphics technology
   decades ahead of its time, convince multiple governments
  to lie on our behalf, and then somehow get
    retro reflectors to the moon without
  actually going there. You could that, right? Forget it, lady.
    It'd be easier to put a man on the moon."

How did we get from one of the greatest technological achievements of the 20th century to believing that it was a massive cover-up by NASA, the CIA, the government or a combination of all three?,  and why almost 50 years after the first Apollo missions, with all the scientific proof available, do an increasing number of people believe in an a radically different version of reality?.
Conspiracy theory’s about the Apollo missions have been circulating since before the moon landings.
One of the first reported instances of people not believing that the moon landings were true came on  December 18th, 1969, 5 months after first moon walk, when the New York Times science reporter , John Noble Wilford in an article called “A Moon Landing? What moon landing?” remarked that ― “A few stool warmers in Chicago bars are on record as suggesting that the Apollo 11 moon walk last July was actually staged by Hollywood on a Nevada desert.”
Six months later, on June 15th 1970, the Atlanta Constitution led with the story “Many skeptics feel moon explorer Neil Armstrong took his ‘giant step for mankind‘ somewhere in Arizona”. The article was based on a poll of 1,721 U.S. citizens that were asked “Do you really, completely believe that the United States has actually landed men on the moon and returned them to earth again?”
The poll results showed that less than 5% of responders in Detroit, Miami, and Akron believed they were fake but that increased to 54% of African Americans in places such as Washington DC.
An early common theme was that because of the cold war between the US and the Soviets, the US could not be seen to lose the race to the moon but when they realized that it couldn’t be done, NASA faked the missions and used the funds to buy the silence of potential whistle blowers.
Other ones said that we could never get to the moon because the astronauts would have been killed by the radiation in the Van Allen Belts which surround the earth. This is down a poor understanding of the science of radiation and that all radiation is not the same. As we will see, It’s this “bad science” that is the underpinning of most the moon hoax theories” 
One theory by William Brian said that we did go to the moon but only with the help of Alien technology and NASA couldn’t risk the public finding out about this as they would have disclosed how they got.

 but only with the help of alien technology and NASA couldn't risk for
 public finding out about this as they wouldn't have to disclose how they got
 it. Another by Richard Hoagland says that NASA had discovered large
 artificial glass structures on the lunar surface and that the astronauts had had
 their memory of any alien encounters erased by hypnosis. He also said that the moon landing hoax
 he's had been created by NASA themselves to act as disinformation to put people
 off the bigger picture of the aliens they had found. You may well recognized a
 similarity to the plot of the 1968 stanley kubrick film ""2001, A Space
 Odyssey"" which in turn was based in 1964 short story by Arthur C Clarke called
 ""The Sentinel"". This was well before the moon landings and any of the subsequent
 moon conspiracy theories so you can see where these ideas can come from. Over time the same early themes have
 been recycled again in again with changes added here and there. One thing
 that does remain the same though is that they are all different, if NASA had
 concocted a hoax they could only be one version of it. It wasn't until 1975 when the first of the so-called evidence-based denials appeared by ""Bill
 Kaysing"", a journalist who had worked Rocketdyne incorporated, the makers of
 the f-1 engines that powered Saturn V moon Rockets. His 1975 self-published booklet
 titled ""We never went to the moon : America's 30 billion dollar swindle""
 which was republished in 1981 and 2002 is acknowledged as the first to lay
 out many of the arguments which have been taken up by the subsequent
 conspiracy theorists. It's here that we see the bad science at work as he puts
 forward the missing stars in the photos of the astronauts, the flag-waving when
 there is no air, the lack of a blast crater from under the lunar lander from
 its descent and optical anomalies in photos taken on the moon. He also puts forward the assumption that
 NASA did not have the technical expertise to operate moon landings and
 that the F-1 rockets were so unreliable the ones on the Apollo 11 rocket were
 faked with smaller B-1 type engines inside of them. This later point has been proven to be
 incorrect by the recovery of the actual F-1 engines used on Apollo 11 from the
 atlantic ocean by Jeff Bezos, the owner of amazon. Kaysing who was never a scientist nor engineer worked as the head of the technical publications and
 as a publications analyst at Rocketdyne until May 31st 1963, some six years
 before the moon landings. He said he came to these and later conclusions because
 he had seen documents relating to Mercury, Gemini Atlas and Apollo and that
 you didn't need to be a trained professional to know a hoax has been
 perpetrated. Kaysings theories subsequently became even more extreme
 when he alleged that NASA haded staged the Apollo 1 fire and the Space Shuttle
 Challenger disaster because the astronauts were about to reveal the hoax
 and they had to silence them in a convincing manner. Hollywood has also helped to popularize
 the moon hoaxes with films like The 1978 ""Capricorn one"" which deals with NASA faking a Mars mission due to technical problems discovered just before the launch that
 would have killed the astronauts they had continued and the ensuing cover up. In
 2001 the conspiracy theorist received a huge boost with the fox TV documentary
 called ""Conspiracy theory:  Did we land on the moon"" the program aired on  mainstream TV and bill Kaysing was one of the main contributors. Because this came out over
 30 years after the moon landings it reintroduced for conspiracy theories to
 a new audience many of which without a technical understanding would have found
 it compelling in its arguments. But the program didn't offer a reply to be
 allegations which included that astronauts and others had died in
 mysterious circumstances to hide the so-called truth. This is where the US government and NASA have been their own worst enemy in creating an atmosphere of distrust and
 enabling the conspiracies to develop. Things like the Watergate debacle, the
 iran-contra affair and the refusal of NASA to talk about the allegations
 because they thought they were just too absurd to warrant a reply just helped the
 conspiracy theorist arguments. An opinion poll conducted in 1964 marked a high
 point for the public belief in the government with 76% of
 people saying that they believe that the U.S. government would do what is right most or all of time. By the early
 1990's that figure had fallen to less than 25%.  It's
 one thing to create conspiracy theories but you still need people to believe in
 them this is where the emphasis moves from a
 hoax creators to the believers and evangelizers that embrace and repeat the
 conspiracy theories often with little regard for poor and incorrect
 understanding of the science that these theories are based on. Belief is the
 major component here. There is a basic tenant in psychology in
 that once someone firmly believes in something over that be conspiracy theories, politics, religious
 beliefs, aliens, ghosts or whatever, no matter what proof is forwarded to the
 country it can be almost impossible for them to
 change their minds because they want to believe in them and for some it's to the
 point of fanatical hostility when repeatedly challenged. In fact there is a
 phenomenon known as the backfire effect where the more aggressively someone
 asserts a particular viewpoint with scientific proof like NASA, the more it
 pushes the conspiracy believers in the opposite direction and reinforces their
 convictions. So why are some people drawn to the alternative viewpoints and others
 not. This tendency cuts across age, race,
 gender, occupation and political standing. One area does show a difference though
 is education. Research carried out by the university of Miami using long-term
 empirical data found that people with a high school education were almost twice
 as likely at 42% to believe in conspiracy theories of all
 types compared to ones with post-graduate degrees at 23%. A recent poll carried out by the Fairleigh Dickinson University showed
 that 63% of registered U.S. voters believe in at least one
 political conspiracy theory. According to professor of psychology Viren Swami 
 of Westminster University England ""once you believe in one conspiracy theory you are much more likely to believe in
 others"" Psychological testing has revealed that people are more
 susceptible to conspiracy theories if they feel anxiou,s under stress or feel
 that they don't have control over their lives, This is believed to trigger some people
 to see non-existent patterns and attribute conspiratorial explanations. Compared to the 60's, 70's and even 80's the world is now a very different place. The so-called surveillance society
 with its privacy issues leaks about eavesdropping on web browsing and emails,
 job uncertainty, poverty, terror attacks and a highly unequal society and living
 in a rapidly changing an unpredictable world all contribute to the feeling of
 lack of control for great deal more people than it did in the past. The Internet has made things worse in a
 way with a world of information both good and bad just a google search away.
 The problem here is of ""Confirmation Bias"" this is the tendency to only believe the
 evidence that supports your point of view and the tribalism of people that
 occurs on chat rooms, blogs, forums and YouTube channels also helps reinforce
 the false information and the ""us and them"" view of the world. Whilst believing
 that you know that NASA faked the moon landings might make you feeling control
 it doesn't actually give you any control. The problem with this lack of faith in
 scientific endeavor is where will it take you in the future. To some it seems no matter what NASA or
 others might do there will always be some form of hidden agenda and this
 negates from the achievements that NASA did 50 years ago and for those which are
 still yet to come. Thank you for watching I hope you

moonlanding,"50 years ago, three NASA astronauts embarked on a journey that would take them “Round the moon and back”. The Apollo 8 mission proved the performance of the command and service module. This historic mission launched on December 21, 1968 to demonstrate a lunar trajectory and was the first crewed launch of the Saturn V rocket. On Christmas Eve, Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders were the first humans to orbit the Moon and the first to see an Earthrise above its surface.

 4.5 billion years ago when, according to one theory, the Earth slammed into another early planet. Debris from this collision
 began to orbit Earth, and accumulated, forming today's moon. The moon is the fifth largest natural satellite in the solar system, with a diameter just
 under the width of China. It's composed of an iron rich core, plus a mantle and crust
 containing minerals made of magnesium, oxygen and silicon. The moon's surface was
 once geologically active and covered in an ocean of magma. But today, apart from traces of water ice, the surface is completely
 covered in dust and rocky debris. Countless craters dot the moon's surface. Each formed by objects such as meteroids, comets and asteroids
 crashing onto the moon. The largest crater, the
 South Pole Aitkin basin, spans across a quarter
 of the moon's surface, and is nearly deep enough
 to fit Mount Everest inside. The moon orbits our planet at an average distance of 30 Earths. It rotates at the same
 rate that it revolves. So as it revolves around our planet, the same side of the moon
 faces the Earth at all times. From the Earth's surface, we can observe eight distinct traditionally recognized stages of the moon's
 illumination, called lunar phases. They have been observed
 for thousands of years, and even provided the basis
 for the earliest calendars. For most of human history, the moon could only be studied from afar. But on July 20th, 1969,
 humans were able to close that distance with the American spaceflight mission Apollo 11. It placed humans on the moon
 for the very first time. Bringing our understanding of Earth's only natural satellite one step closer."

moonlanding,"Talk about voxels and cones too dry to pique your interest in real-time lighting tech? Then have a peek at this re-creation of the lunar landing from last week's GAME24 livestream, which convincingly proves that man actually did set foot on the moon.",Nvidia Debunks Conspiracy Theories About Moon Landing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syVP6zDZN7I,-1,3097519,24857,12679,27028,syVP6zDZN7I,"on July 20th 1969 three astronauts flew three days to the moon when they got there two astronauts Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin got into the lunar excursion module called the LEM and made their way down to the moon the journey took another two and a half hours it was apparently a lot harder than they expected with only 40 seconds worth of fuel Neil lands the lam on the surface of the Moon Michael Collins orbiting the moon waiting for their return shortly after they landed Armstrong left the LEM and makes the first step on the moon that step one small step for man one giant step for mankind shortly after Buzz Aldrin makes his way out of the LEM and very carefully without locking the door to hatch because as it turned out they never designed a door handle on the outside makes his way out of the limb and down the stairs what you're looking at here is that seminal photograph that was taken by Neil Armstrong a seminal photograph taken by Neil Armstrong of Buzz Aldrin as they landed on the moon as they stood as they stepped onto the lunar surface of Tranquility Bay's tranquility base well those photographs came back to earth and of course to this day still takes my breath away thinking about it it was a step for man but surely a giant step for man come but those photographs came back inspired hundreds of millions but at the same time caused many people to be quite excited about whether the origin of this photograph was truly from the moon there was good reason for them to question these photographs first of all when you look at that image of Buzz Aldrin and you look at the shadows on the ground the dark shadows he's surely in shadow if he's surely in shadow because the Sun is on the other side of the limb how is it possible that he is that bright second we know there is no atmosphere on the moon and if there's no atmosphere on the moon we should be able to see the stars clearly they knew that we could very easily through the positioning of the stars determine whether they were actually on the moon and the belief is that it must have been too complicated to line those up so they decided to leave them out it is possible that this photograph was taken here on earth now with the invention of VX GI and through the extraordinary efforts of our engineers we meticulously we meticulously model the lunar nun here's the wonderful thing about the lunar LEM it's made out of aluminum aluminum foil cloth and a generous application of tape it was a flying coke can no wonder Aldrin and Armstrong wanted to get out of that thing as fast as they could was a flying cocaine we modeled every detail we had to model every single detail we modelled them surface of the Moon so that we could start to study and test these mysteries and come to our own conclusion through scientific means whether it is possible whether they did land on the moon ladies and gentlemen I'd like to demonstrate to you guys now our work single little detail now first of all come on fess up you thought that was a photograph right that was a photograph you thought you thought that was a photograph the first time I saw it well first time I saw it it was rough but by the time I saw the final works I thought it was a photograph it was really it's really really amazing work the engineers modeled every little detail and so let's go through and let's think about let's test each one of those conspiracy theories the first one is this Kurtis let's go to let's let's assume that he is in shadow and that they're the only light source is direct well this is what it would look like this is what buzz would and this is what people expected him to look like and the reason for that is because the Sun is on the other side of the Lamb and you can also see the shadows on the ground are perfectly dark so how is it possible that he's lit was it turns out we modelled the entire surface of the moon we modelled the dust particles of the moon and we learned this we learned that the dust particles on the moon which is created obviously from asteroids my barding to moon okay relentless over billions of years it's fine particles and in fact has reflective properties now the reflective properties are not great it only reflects about 10-12 percent of the light that hits it however as a mini type of dust particles and crystals when a light hits it directly and you look at it from the same angle as the light source the reflected light is multiple times brighter than it otherwise would have reflected it's a phenomenon called opposition surge well we simulated the properties of the moon dust and as you can see right now the Sun is behind me the lamb is beside me notice the brightness of the Sun as is electing off the lunar surface well suppose we were to turn on VX GI and we turn every single surface into a light source so that it reflects the light let's see what happens well voila reflecting off of this lunar surface reflecting off of the lunar surface the Sun was able to light Buzz Aldrin well that's mystery number one mystery number two is this why is it that while we're looking at him right now we don't see the stars well that's a simple answer turns out it's a simple matter of exposure the light is so bright in fact the light is so bright in fact that they had to change the exposure to their camera to the point where you're not over blindingly bright on the surface of the Moon while therefore you're no longer able to see the Stars and so what we did was this in fact when we look out into into the sky we've modeled all 84,000 of the closest stars around Earth that we can see from Earth and if we were to change our exposure this is what we would see not Curtis what would happen now if we were to look back down now this is what they would have seen if they were to were to adjust their pupil and got accustomed to seeing the stars and then look back down everything would be so white so bright because of the sun's brightness reflecting off the surface of the moon now let's change the exposure again please look how beautiful that is huh hey guys what do you think real-time computer graphics with real-time global illumination well there's another conspiracy this particular question was kind of interesting well it turns out can we go to the slide please when you look at this other iconic image of buzz stepping on the moon it's taken from a camera that plops down from the lamb and a captured Neil Armstrong coming off the ladder and a captured Buzz Aldrin coming off the ladder the theory that this this photograph was in fact taken on earth was because they believed some believed that that light source that really bright light source beyond buzz was in fact a light that they forgot or somehow mistakenly did not take out of the way when they took this picture and so a word go back to our simulation in fact if you were to look at that well shucks that's an interesting question that's an interesting question until if you were to figure out where Neil Armstrong was standing where Neil Armstrong was standing when he took the other iconic photograph you'll discover that lo and behold there's a white object there well here's the amazing thing Neil Armstrong's spacesuit is made out of largely Teflon a material called beta material beta cloth and it has a reflectivity of about 90% all the light that is that hits Neil Armstrong 90% of it bounces off me you could just imagine how bright the Sun is without being disrupted by the atmosphere it lights up Neil Armstrong and it helped us solve one last unexplained issue when we were working on this project the one last thing we could never figure out is why is it that when we compared and now we've simulated everything to death we simulate the brightness of the Sun we simulate the reflectivity and the material of the lunar surface we've captured all of the geometry we've put all the right materials into the lunar lander and a lunar lander is reflecting off and also projecting its light on Buzz we've modeled every little detail now why is it that when we look at it Buzz still seem too dark well it wasn't until we modeled Neil Armstrong and we put him in the scene that we were able to see the difference how about let's to turn Neil on and off off on off on that little tiny detail and we'll show you in just a second it's so compelling that we now understand why it is that Buzz was lit the way he was well let's take a look at let's step out and take a look at Neil and what he looks at looks like there's Neil yeah isn't that beautiful the extraordinary detail that the engineers put into it is just really really wonderful to see and then lastly let's compare the before and after if you can go to slides if you're not sure the right side is the photograph the left side is the simulation what do you guys think in the example of the Cornell box I used essentially a photograph to test real-time computer graphics and we continue to improve its capabilities we added VH GI and as a result of that real-time computer graphics came awfully close to the image that was generated by eye rain now that we have the xgi we use the technology the engineers use the technology to test against a controversial iconic seminal photograph that was taken in the 60s"

cosmologists Sarah Bosman at Martin we have to go to you first of all why do you think it didn't happen well there's overwhelming proof that it didn't happen there's people researching this topic a lot more in the age of technology now I think in the past like you're saying we had no way of verifying anything we're told so we saw the moon landings while you saw the moon landings and you believed it but there was no way for you to check any of it and now in the age of technology as you said a lot of the young people believe that it was faked and that's because they are now investigating for themselves I find it very interesting and we talked to Sara in a minute about the scientific side that she believes but for me personally I just think far too many people would have to cover it up cover up for far too many how many people never have slipped up how many people have supposedly gone beyond low-earth orbit beyond 200 miles off the earth no idea 20 for the tire history of humanity but what 24 people say you're only 24 but the one thing is there was a whole control center Operations Center backup control all sorts of things do you know what happened in the finest Department of ITV in the finance department no idea do you know what happen live do you know what happens in the executive office of ITV right at the top no they tell you nothing exactly but if something did happen but if somebody's moving something up yeah everybody would have to cover it up no they wouldn't because you wouldn't know it what do you think of Engineers of course working on these for years and years they'll had to come in to their job every morning thinking they were developing a rocket and that's thousands of people being involved development and the testing in the labs people overseeing the labs it's not only the 24 people who actually went off the earth it's a whole organization of NASA and the Apollo program the position of the Sun shadows you will add to that but today using today's technology you cannot see footprints which you believe shouldn't have ever blown away yep well here's the smoking gun here's the smoking gun we can argue all day long about yeah you know what I think what we've never been to the moon none of us have been you know below the surface a certain altitude now the only way we can discern whether this happened or not is by analyzing and studying the actual data that was taken during those Apollo missions right the scientific data hold on let me finish let me finish right so that's the telemetry data right so during those four years that they did their pala missions they collected loads of data you know biometrical data design blueprints etc etc right to end this if we had the data now and we could scrutinize it if we could test it which is the scientific method test it yourself observe it's not any research not only has it not been released NASA destroyed it well or law why would they have destroyed nice as well well hang on hang on Donald petites Donald Petite NASA astronaut and chemical engineer this is a direct quote from him there's a video of him actually saying this and I quote okay I'll go to the moon in a nanosecond the problem is we don't have the technology to do that anymore you see and it's a painful process to build up again you're absolutely not context absolutely I completely agree with him the technology we had at the time was so ridiculously obsolete there was nothing we could do with it anymore it's like if you have a car from 60 years ago that's what is unique if you try to repair all the parts one by one is gonna take you way too much money we don't run cars that way anymore it was scrapped eventually because that's just too outdated so of course it was destroy the technology in that sense we don't have it anymore it wouldn't run Sarah we got the technology together to go there why haven't we been back since is it what the 70s I think it's it comes down to the funding I think after America went to the moon a few times the people in power told the voters why are we spending all so much money on this when we elect a party well pay more taxes to do something else and unfortunately it was the last time in history where so much of your taxes went to science and research and technology is been cut down a lot to think mostly for political reasons but you see Martin actually believes what we think some people believe the moon is made of cheese what do you think the moon is made of what I know the moon is it's a luminary that's all I know what the chimes it's a luminary it's it's a it's a luminary of some sort so I can't go beyond that you know again we begin the age of technology you know you've got a P 900 camera now you can buy for under a thousand pounds yeah and you can zoom in to the moon that's supposed to be by the way two hundred and thirty eight thousand miles away in deep dark space and yet you can zoom in quite close in detail with a commercial camera and people have taken photographs and images showing it sometimes translucent you can see through it right sometimes it's got something called a lunar wave there are many videos showing the moon with a lunar wave we don't know what that is it's all a mystery so you believe you couldn't possibly land on it because not salutely not if it isn't true is he really doing any harm or is it just an interesting theory there's nothing wrong with people looking at data themselves and looking at buying their own cameras and taking their own data and so on I think the main problem with the new moon conspiracy is that the people involved that would have to cover it up now also involve people in Japan with these new satellites people in Russia people in Australia who would all have to be covering up when I do this follow-up America why would they be covering up what America did 50 years ago I mean even Russia at the time admitted there were beats on in the space right so they had the most reason yeah to not believe the America it's a blow but was so horrible yeah you

The moon landing was fake! In this video I teach you how the moon landing was faked and why it was fake with 13 clear cut reasons. The moon landing hoax isn't just a conspiracy, it's true!",13 Reasons Why the Moon Landing was FAKE - Ultra Spiritual life episode 125,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhxTwcslfCY,1,469825,12180,1795,6068,QhxTwcslfCY,there were six alleged moon landings between 1969 and 1972 and there's been zero moon landing since seems a little suspicious doesn't it well that's because we never went to the moon let me prove it to you with 13 reasons why the moon landing was faked why would America faked the moon landing well at the time the US was in the heat of the Cold War with the Soviet Union and the space race was important because of the fear that the Soviet Union might weaponize space by putting missile launch sites on the moon leaving the u.s. defenseless now the US had already been beaten by the Soviet Union and putting the first person into space they asserted their dominance over us like the dog whisperer putting a hostile rescue dog from Tijuana in its place but if we could be the first to the moon then we'd be the new alpha dog in the world but in this case what creates the alpha dog isn't the size of the fight in the dog it's the size of the lie in the dog that's in the fight thus the u.s. became the new alpha dog when we were the first nation to fake the moon landing the US government also faked the moon landing to distract the public from the Vietnam War which wasn't very popular it's like if I'm doing something you disapprove of and I can distract you from it then you don't notice your disapproval of the thing I'm still doing look over there a moon landing now let's look at some hard evidence the flag waving in the wind now take a look at the astronauts proudly planting the American flag on the moon is it gracefully waves in the wind there's this one problem with this there's no wind on the moon Einstein evidence of a hoax no dust kicked up on the lunar landing take a close look at the lunar module you'll see there's no dust on the foot pads and it didn't leave a blast crater either this would be approximately like diving into a swimming pool in your car and not making a splash guess what the moon's surface is covered in dust it's not like landing in a Walmart parking lot covered in pavement so it would be impossible to land on the moon surface without taking up a dust storm no stars in any photos there are no stars in any photos taken from the moon now where the Stars just watched out by the intense inner city street lights that are on the moon or are there just no stars visible from the pretend moon inside of a Hollywood sound stage I don't know I'm just asking questions here fixtures have the same background look at these two photos two different locations on the moon but each have the exact same background looks like the set designers got a little lazy and decided they'd go with the same background for two different fake locations the crosshairs crosshairs were etched into the lens of the camera the astronauts for using yet in the number of photos an object allegedly on the moon appears in front of the crosshairs this is foul play the only way an object could appear in front of the crosshairs is if the object were superimposed on the photo fake photos trying to fake a real moon landing competing shadows there's one source of light on the moon it's called the Sun yet some photos have shadows going at two different angles suggesting multiple light sources which suggest studio lighting which suggests not moon lighting not to mention photos where the astronauts are backlit by the Sun yet you can still see the detail on front of the astronauts hashtag studio lighting now even getting to the moon alive would be impossible because of the van Halen radiation belt the Van Allen radiation belt no one could survive the trip through this intense radiation belt that surrounds the earth can a cat survive being put in a microwave no which proves astronauts can't survive being put through the Van Allen radiation belt Buzz Aldrin doing his best Mike Tyson now in 2002 Buzz Aldrin punched a reporter who is denying the moon landing ever happened quite the reaction seems like old Buzz was feeling a little insecure about something wasn't he now how did the u.s. faked the moon landing I've got two words for you Stanley Kubrick he was hired by the government to direct and film the fake moon landing inside a Hollywood sound stage and he could never tell the truth because if he did they would kill him and he knew it that's why in his 1980 movie The Shining he revealed the truth through a trail of secret messages first take a look at the kid Danny who obviously represents Stanley Birk himself in the film he's wearing an Apollo 11 sweater which tells you Kubrick was Apollo 11 next take a look at the scene involving room 237 room 237 obviously represents the moon because it's approximately two hundred thirty seven thousand miles from the earth and take a look at the room key it says room no 237 which means no moon plus if you take the end from the word no use it to replace the R in the word room then flip the word backwards you've got the word Moon and then after Danny enters the forbidden room 237 which represents the moon landing that took place behind closed doors his sweater is tattered Mia's marks on his throat and he won't tell his mother what happened this represents NASA's stranglehold on Kubrick to keep silent about the moon landing hoax the cases of tang by Jack's head in the storage closet correlate to tang being on the Apollo missions and how the truth is supposed to be kept in the closet we could also then reason to believe that the psychotic break of Jack Nicholson's character is Kubrick's portrayal of what the pressure was like of keeping such a huge secret for so long and some would even say that the whole movie was Kubrick's way of apologizing for being a part of the biggest lie in human history Stanley Kubrick's whole intent of the shining was quite poetic in nature let the truth live beyond him and indeed it did Kubrick allegedly died in 1999 of a heart attack yeah not very likely it's more probable the government finally got their eyes wide open tohoku Brooksville the truth about the moon landing 19 years earlier in the shining and then decided to execute that do not talk clause in their contract if you know what I mean so NASA we haven't been back to the moon for nearly 50 years why is that the NASA is like yeah in the past 50 years technology's actually gotten worse yeah the experts say human knowledge is doubling every 13 months and yeah your smartphone has more computing power than all of NASA's computers combined in 1969 but aside from all that technology is actually getting worse making it impossible to go back to the moon yeah yeah so that's pretty much our airtight reason for why we haven't been back to the moon for 50 years and all follow-up questions will be answered with the term budget cuts you know what NASA I don't buy into your Cold War winning deceiving the American people propaganda moon landing fake oh and by the way the earth is flat do you want to watch my video proving how that's absolutely true click here hashtag flattered

 probably starting on the PTC. CAPCOM Roger, no sweat, 11. We’re standing by. Over. PAO This is Apollo Control. That was Nell Armstrong reporting that they
 are now reinstalling the probe and drogue, which is Just about on the flight plan schedule,
 and they reported that they would be putting the spacecraft in a slow roll shortly to maintain
 passive thermal control. In that mode the spacecraft rotates at the
 rate of about 3 revolutions per hour to maintain even heating. We have a precise time on that sphere of influence
 change, the point of which the moon - for calculation purposes here. Mission Control, comes under the predominate
 influence – the spacecraft comes under the predominate influence of the moon's gravitational
 field, and we now calculate that that will occur at 61 hours, 39 minutes, 55 seconds,

 contingency checklist, if you would break that out. Over. SC Stand by. SC Okay, Houston. It’s ready to copy. CAPCOM Roger, 11. If you'll turn to page F/2-22. Over. SC Okay, I have F/2-22. CAPCOM Roger, Nell. Under column L - that's column Lema, line
 06. The new data is 00001. Line 07, the new data is 02134. Over. SC Okay, I have in F/2-22, column Lema, item
 6, 00001. Item 7, 02134. CAPCOM Roger, that's correct. Thank you much. Out. CAPCOM 11, Houston. For your information, those 2 entries are
 an update to your Delta-H that we have already uplinked into the CMC. Over. SC Roger. Thank you. SC Well, what was I marking on, Charlie, about
 an 18 parameter line or what? CAPCOM Our update puts you to the Delta-H
 to 35 parameters, Mike. Over. SC Okay. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. We've got some switch positions for you for
 the high gain, over. SC Okay, go ahead. CAPCOM Roger, Buzz. Select BRAVO, OMNI, high-gain track to manual
 beam wide, over. SC Okay, Bravo, OMNI track manual and beam
 Y. CAPCOM Roger, and your high-gain angles are
 minus 50 on the pitch, 270 on the yaw, over. SC Okay, going there now. CAPCOM We have some updates and some things
 we'd like to talk to you about, if you aren't in the middle of your meal. If it's convenient any time for you, we're
 ready with some updates. Over. SC What are the updates going to apply to? CAPCOM Roger. We have a couple of changes on the LM mission
 rules NO/GO for your NO/GO card, Neil. One slight change on the APS DPS fuel and
 temp pressure cards, and we have a change to the procedure
 for the secondary radiator leak check, which is to be formed at - performed at 71 hours
 tomorrow, and also some indications that we have a couple of landing site obliques stowed
 in the wrong place. Over. SC Okay, if any of those in the flight plan. The secondary radiator, for example. CAPCOM That's affirmative. The secondary radiator leak check is called
 out in the flight plan at 71:20. That procedure is listed in your launch operations
 book on page 2-9, L2-9. We'd like to change that procedure. Over. SC Okay. Stand by. SC Charlie, on the secondary leak check, just
 read us verbatim like you want, and I'll copy directly into the flight plan and not fool
 around with the checklist. CAPCOM Roger. That's fine if you're ready to copy, stand
 by. SC Ready to copy on the leak check. CAPCOM Roger. It's monitor the secondary accumulator quantity. Step 2 is secondary glycol to radiator valve
 normal for 30 seconds then bypass. If no decrease in
 secondary accumulator quantity, - Are you with me? SC Yah, I'm with you. CAPCOM Okay. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity. Secondary glycol to radiator valve to normal. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump AC1
 or AC2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol discharge secondary
 pressure 39 to 51 psig. Also verify secondary EVAP APS TEMP has changed. Next step, secondary coolant loop pump, off. Secondary glycol radiator valve to bypass. That ends the procedure. Over. SC Okay. I read back monitor secondary accumulator
 quantity, secondary glycol radiator valve, normal for 30 seconds then to bypass. If no decrease in secondary accumulator quantity,
 secondary glycol to radiator valve to normal. Secondary coolant loop pump AC1 or 2. After 3 minutes, verify glycol secondary discharge
 pressure 39 to 51 psig. Verify secondary evaporator outlet temp has
 changed. Secondary coolant
 loop, off. Secondary glycol radiator valve to bypass. And what's the reason for the change, Charlie? CAPCOM Roger. Stan is concerned that our present procedure
 as shown in the checklist does not really flow a glycol through the radiator and they
 want to verify that we do not have a plugged secondary
 radiator. Over. SC Okay. They didn't have any abnormal indications
 in that system, so far? CAPCOM Negative. This is the procedure that came up with. It's just a check, Mike. Everything's looking great to us. Over. SC Okay, Charlie. SC Charlie, we'll get back with you on these
 other changes in a few minutes. Okay? CAPCOM Roger, Nell. No hurry. Over. PAO This is Apollo Control at 59 hours, 9
 minutes. Apollo 11 now 182 000 nautical miles from
 Earth, and the velocity down to 3072 feet per second. We've had
 very little conversation from the spacecraft in the past 40 minutes or so. At this time the flight plan calls for the
 crew to be getting ready to begin their eat period. That would be followed by a 9 hour rest period. We have one change to the flight plan to pass
 along. The television transmission which had been
 scheduled at 100 hours, 20 minutes to I00 hours, 50 minutes in the flight plan has been
 deleted. This transmission was to have occurred during
 the formation flying prior to the powered descent to the lunar surface. The decision to delete the TV transmission
 from the flight plan was made due to a lack of available satellite channels to relay the
 signal from the tracking site at Madrid to Houston for conversion. The intermittent music that we're getting
 is apparently coming from the spacecraft. The crew has onboard portable tape recorders
 with music on the tapes. As they store their own comments on the tape,
 the music, of course, is erased and apparently the music is triggering the VOX operated microphones
 and we're getting intermittent music down from the spacecraft. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We were wondering who's on horns? SC Back in Houston? CAPCOM We just had a little music there. SC Just to keep you entertained. CAPCOM Rog. That was good. You can keep it coming down, 11. SC Okay. SC Because it's a special occasion today,
 Houston. This is the third anniversary of Gemini 10. CAPCOM Roger. Happy anniversary. SC Stay there. PAO This is Apollo Control. That comment a moment ago about the tenth
 anniversary of - about the third anniversary of Gemini 10 came from Mike Collins, who along
 with John Young flew the Gemini 10 mission, July 18 through July 21, 1966. PAO This is Apollo Control. That comment a moment ago about the tenth
 anniversary of - about the third anniversary of Gemini 10 came from Mike Collins, who along
 with John Young flew the Gemini 10 mission, July 18 through July 21, 1966. The brief bit of music that we got from the
 spacecraft was coming to us from a distance of 182 thousand 190 nautical miles. SC Houston, Apollo 11, ready to copy your
 updates. CAPCOM Roger, stand by. CAPCOM Okay Buzz, the first item, is that
 we have indications that your landing sight obliques are not in the proper position. If you will check we think that the intermediate
 scale landing sight oblique is stowed in the CSM lunar land mark book. We think that the large scale, landing sight
 oblique is stowed in the back of the LM lunar surface map book, over. SC I think I heard you Charlie, but I'm not
 sure that I understand. CAPCOM Roger, according to our storage list
 the landing sight oblique should be in the transfer bag. In the back up set of data, the intermediate
 scale oblique is in the CSM lunar landmark book and the large scale oblique is in the
 back of the LM lunar surface map book, and that's the reason we think that they might
 be, not where you think they are, over. SC Okay, we've got three obliques. The last one is one I asked for recently. It's just a blow up of the second one. The first one is one that's got dotted lines
 on it, indicating hidden view and 50 degree LPD,
 and all three of those are in the transfer book, over. CAPCOM Roger, fine. We were wrong in our back up set. We had those out of place. Looks like the on board data is good. We just wanted to let you check on that one. We have an update on the APS DIPS fuel cord
 that you place on the panel. It's a typo error. If you'll break out that little card, we've
 got to correct that typo error, over. SC Rog. SC Okay, I got it. CAPCOM Rog, Buzz. Under the DIPS column, on the pressure side. You go down to the fourth item to the pressure
 greater than 150 PTCA should be greater than 65 percent, over. SC Okay, it's greater than 1.8 but less than
 65 and greater than 150 for greater than 65. CAPCOM That's affirmative. Out. CAPCOM And we have three items on the mission
 rules no go card, if you are ready to copy those, over. SC Okay, I've got the mission rules no go. CAPCOM Roger, Buzz. First entry is on the EPS, under AC bus A.
 The line extends all the way to high gate. Actually, the line should read at DOI it would
 be no go AC bus A. After that the no go would be both
 buses. So if you will just pencil in both buses from
 TDI through high gate. It will be correct for that line, over. SC Okay, I got that AC buss A for DOI and
 both busses no go for PDI on. CAPCOM That's affirmative up until high gate. You can stop at - the line in front of the
 column 5 minutes to low gate. Now the next line is under the G&C exchange,
 pitch and roll GDA. You can scratch that line completely, over. SC Roger, got it. CAPCOM Okay, Buzz. Last entry is down under RCS and it is a typo
 error under the three - in the line three axis attitude control. We proceed to the right at PDI plus 05 you'll
 see one axis. The line goes all the way to low gate to touchdown. That's incorrect. The line should stop under 5 minutes to low
 gate, over. SC Okay, we are stopping at it 5 minutes to
 low gate. CAPCOM That's affirm. That completes that card. The rest of the update are just really for
 your information based on our 58 hour platform - look at the platform. We are
 really in good shape. Your gyros have almost no drift in them since
 the plotted update we were looking at X of a minus 2.24 MERU, Y of plus .87 Z of minus
 .11. Since the update, which was based on the 52
 hour P52, I believe. We gave you
 an X drift of plus .79, yaw of plus 1.06, Z of plus .02 MERU. The difference we see between the 52 hour
 and the 57 hour alignments work did not really give us enough time to get a real good, completely
 valid update on the drift check. So we're real satisfied with the way the gyros
 are looking. The PIPA'S are looking great
 also. We are in real good shape with those also,
 over. SC This is Apollo 11, radio check. CAPCOM Roger, reading you fly by OMNI, over. SC Okay, that’s clear. You cut out when you were talking about the
 platform at something about 52 hours and.after that we never heard you again. CAPCOM Roger, guess we were changing antennas. Stand by. That's affirmative, 11. We were swapping antennas on you down here. Basically the word here is that we have a
 real good platform, very small drift on the gyros and very small drift in our PIPA'S,
 over. SC Roger, thank you. And I would like to have a few words of clarification
 if you will give them to me on the RCS reel, what that change of pitch may mean. CAPCOM Copy, a few words of clarification
 on the RCS, oh roger. The update there, Neil, you are speaking of
 about the one axis down to 5 minutes of low gate? SC Yah, that's right. I'm not quite sure what that really means
 (garbled). CAPCOM Standby, I'll make sure I got my story
 straight with Control. Standby. SC Okay . CAPCOM 11, Houston. On the RCS, what we about one axis prior to
 low gate, we would recommend an abort. This would require a- a loss of - of two distinct
 jets which is not very probable but that is what we are recommending. After low gate we would - continue on. We would recommend that we continue on to
 attempt a landing, over. SC Roger. Okay. I think I owed him that. CAPCO Rog. SC Charlie, did you say you had some updates
 for me from the lunar surface book? CAPCOM Apollo 11, say again. You were cutting out. Over. SC Roger. Did you say you had some updates for us in
 the lunar surface book? Over. CAPCOM Negative. At this time, we do not have any updates for
 the lunar surface book. We wanted you to have it just in case. Over. SC Rog. You were cut out that time. CAPCOM Roger. At the present time, we do not have any updates
 for you on the lunar surface book. We are thinking about some, and kick him around,
 but they're very minor changes. Over. CAPCOM I1, Houston. Did you copy that transmission? CAPCOM Apollo ll, Houston. We swapped antennas on you again. I say again that we do not have any lunar
 surface update - book updates at this time. We're considering a few minor ones, but we're
 ... around  the MOCR. Over. SC Apollo 11. I understand. SC Houston, 11. We have a crew status report for you. CAPCOM Roger. Go ahead, 11. SC Okay, radiation CDR 11009, CMP 10010, LMP
 09011. No medication. CAPCOM Roger, 11. We copy for the radiations and we're considering
 this PTC looks sort of weird to us so we're considering stopping and starting over
 again and we'll be with you in a couple of minutes. Over. SC Okay. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give us the LM CM Delta-P as reading? Over. CAPCOM Hello Apollo i1, Houston. We switched the antennas on you again. Would you please give us the LM CM Delta-P
 reading? Over. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Over. SC Go ahead. 11 here. CAPCOM Rog. We switched antennas on you there moments
 ago, Neil. Will you please give us the LM CM Delta-P
 reading? Over. SC It's less than 21. CAPCOM Roger. SC 21.5 now Neil says, Charlie. CAPCOM Roger, thank you Mike, could you give
 us some help? This PTC is strange, it's not like anything
 we've seen before. We were wondering if you all have had any
 events of any odd data that could help us out, over. SC I didn't understand that. Say again. CAPCOM Roger, we're looking at a, sort of
 a funny looking PTC. We've already drifted out to 70 degrees in
 pitch and we're wondering if you all had any vents or any
 such thing as that, that could have caused us to pick up these rates to drive us off,
 over. SC Negative, Charlie. We don't know of anything. CAP COM Roger. SC Unless it’s got something to do with
 that entry from the position that we want to be in. I don't know. CAPCOM Roger, when we started off it looked
 real fine to us, now it's drifting off with a funny pattern that we haven't seen previously
 on a flight, and we're just trying to figure out, I think we'll probably start it over
 again. We'll be with you momentarily, over. SC Okay. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We hate to say it, but we'd like to terminate
 this PTC and start over again. We bare no assurance that we're going to get
 it through the sleep period. With this funny configuration, or funny pattern. We'd like you to stop it now and go back to
 pitch 090 yaw 0 and roll, whatever you stop on, over. SC Roger. PAO This is Apollo Control at 59 hours 57
 minutes. A few moments ago you heard Capcom Charlie
 Duke advise the crew to terminate the passive thermal control
 mode that they are presently in and reestablish the three revolutions per hour roll rate about
 the spacecraft longitudinal axis that is used for thermal control. We had noticed a
 unexplained deviation from the attitude that the spacecraft was set up in. In this roll mode ideally it would roll about
 the longitudinal axis with very little wobble and if wobble
 is introduced for one reason or another, the reaction control system jets would come on
 as soon as the motion out of the prescribed plane had occurred and gone beyond prescribed
 limits, in this case 30 degrees to correct. The jet firings on past missions do tend to
 disturb the crew’s sleep. Rather than have the reaction control system
 jets come on during the night and perhaps have to awaken the crew to reestablish the
 passive thermal control mode at that time we elected to correct it now. CAPCOM You disabled Bravo and Charlie select
 quads ALPHA and DELTA, over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston, over. PAO This is Apollo Control. We're getting quite a bit of noise on the
 air to ground circuit at this time as the spacecraft rotates from one OMNI antenna around
 to the next and we momentarily- lose lock-on. At this time, Apollo i1 is 183,544 nautical
 miles from Earth and the velocity, holding fairly constant now, at about 3042 feet per
 second. It's been moving down towards 3000 feet per
 second and seems to be leveling off somewhat. PAO This is Apollo Control. We're going to take the air to ground circuit
 down temporarily until a stronger antenna lock is - . Here's a call to the crew. We'll stand by for that. PAO This is Apollo Control. We will take down the air to ground circuit
 down at this time until we reestablish sufficient signal strength to eliminate the noise on
 the circuit. PAO This is Apollo Control at 60 hours, 10
 minutes. We've reestablished good antenna lock-on this
 time, and we'll continue to monitor for any conversation from
 the spacecraft. The crew is presently reestablishing the passive
 thermal control rotation rate of 3 revolutions per hour. Following that we expect they will begin their
 rest period. At the present time Apollo I1 is 183 821 nautical
 miles from Earth at a velocity 3037 feet per second. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11. Hello, Apollo 11. Over SC Hello, Houston. You call us? CAPCOM Roger. Reading you about 1 by. Looks like we picked a super attitude here
 for PTC stabilization. We're reading you in backup voice now. Over. SC You're reading me loud and clear? CAPCOM Rog. SC Would you like us to take another antenna? CAPCOM I think we've got about the best configuration. We have been doing it off the ground here,
 11. We'll just keep it as it is. Over. SC Roger. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Would you select COMMAND RESET and OMNI ALPHA? Over. SC Houston, 11. We're in OMNI ALPHA. CAPCOM Roger. We read you about 3 by now. Over. SC Roger. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We is stable. You can start the PTC. Over. SC Roll left, don't you? SC Houston, Apollo 11. Check this page S-9-7. I've completed step 8 and I'd like to know
 what you think is ideal timing between step 8 and step 9 and step 10 on that page? Over. CAPCOM Roger. Stand by. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We don't see any time constraint. We'd like you to go ahead and set up the wide
 deadband, then go through step 10 and 11. Over. SC Okay. Will do. I don't see any constraint here, Charlie. I was just checking to make sure because last
 time, I went from 8 to 9 to 10 to 11 a little bit more swiftly than I'd been doing in the
 past. CAPC0M Roger. SC Step 11 complete. CAPCOM Roger. We copy. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Would you please select OMNI BRAVO? Over. SC Roger. BRAVO. SC Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read on BRAVO? CAPCOM Roger. Reading you 5 by. SC Same here. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Looks like we've got a good PTC going. It's good night from the white team. Over. SC Okay. See you tomorrow. Thank you for everything. PAO This is Apollo Control at 60 hours 37
 minutes. We said good bye - goodnight to the crew about
 10 minutes ago. We expect that they will be settling down
 their rest period shortly. And at the present time, Apollo 11 is 184,600
 nautical miles from earth. The spacecraft velocity is presently 3,023
 feet per second. I understand there has been some interest
 in a comment made by Nell Armstrong during the television transmission about the EVA
 floodlight. Armstrong's remark was that the mast which
 the light is mounted on, appeared charred. He reported that the light works but had apparently
 the mast that supported it had apparently been damaged during the launch phase. This light would be used in the event of a
 contingency EVA. It would have to function in a normal mission
 such as we are presently flying. And in the event that a extravehicular activity
 was necessary for transfer of the crew from the LM into the command service module, the
 light would be an aid in providing exterior lighting of the hand rails, but would- repeat,
 that it would have no function in a normal mission and the charring which Armstrong reported
 is not considered significant at this time. We don't expect to have any further conversation
 with the crew. We will continue to record any remarks that
 we get and play those back. The passive thermal control mode, which was
 reestablished, appears to be functioning well at this time and all spacecraft systems are
 functioning normally. At 100 - rather 60 hours 39 minutes, this
 is Apollo Control, Houston. PAO This is Apollo Control an 60 hours 47
 minutes. We just got a call from the spacecraft requesting
 that we give them the position of the S-IVB in respect to the
 spacecraft and we're currently coming up with that bit of information, so we'll stand by. SC Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM Go ahead, 11, over. SC Do you have any idea where the S-IVB is
 with respect to us? CAPCOM Stand by. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston, the S-IVB is about
 6000 nautical miles from you now, over. SC Okay, thank you. SC Houston, Apollo 11, how is the PTC looking? CAPCOM Stand by. CAPCOM 11, Houston. The PTC looks great to us, over. SC Hey, do you have any idea what happened
 to the previous one? CAPCOM We have absolutely no idea, over. SC Okay. Did it look like it was all right and just
 all of a sudden start diverting? CAPCOM Negative, if you look at the plot which
 we'll save for you and let you see it post flight. It started off immediately on the first rev
 and just spiraled out to about oh, 20 to 20 degrees in pitch, and then it seemed to be
 setting up a spiral around an offset pitch point of about 20 degrees off from 90 degrees,
 but we didn't want to take a chance that it would become stable at that point. We thought it might diverge so we told you
 and started over again, over. SC Okay, no complaints. I was just curious as to what had happened. 5"
moonlanding,Audio highlights from the eighth day of the Apollo 11 mission.,Apollo 11 Mission Audio - Day 8,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMFolzWdnWw,0,4921,60,2,3,UMFolzWdnWw,"ARMSTRONG Good evening. This is the Commander of Apollo
 11. A hundred years ago, Jules Verne wrote a book about a voyage to the moon. His spaceship,
 Columbia, took off from Florida and landed in the Pacific Ocean after completing a trip
 to the moon. It seems appropriate to us to share with you some of the reflections of
 the crew as the modern day Columbia completes its rendezvous with the planet Earth in the
 same Pacific Ocean tomorrow. First, Mike Collins. COLLINS Roger. This trip of ours to the moon may have
 looked to you simple or easy. I'd like to say that that has not been a game. The Saturn
 V rocket which put us into orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece
 of which worked flawlessly. This computer up above my head has a 38,000 word vocabulary,
 each word of which has been very carefully chosen to be of the utmost value to us, the
 crew. This switch which I have in my hand now has over 300 counterparts in the command
 module alone. There is one single switch designed. In addition to that, there are myriads of
 circuit breakers, levers, rods, and other associated controls. The SPS engine, our large
 rocket engine on the AFT end of our service module, must have performed flawlessly or
 we would have been stranded in lunar orbit. The parachutes up above my head must work
 perfectly tomorrow or we will plummet into the ocean. We have always had confidence that
 all this equipment will work and work properly, and we continue to have confidence that it
 will do so for the remainder of the flight. All this is possible only through the blood,
 sweat, and tears of a number of people. First the American workmen, who put these pieces
 of machinery together in the factory. Second, the painstaking work done by the various test
 teams during the assembly and retest after assembly. And finally, the people at the Manned
 Spacecraft Center, both in management, in mission planning, in flight control, and last,
 but not least in crew training. This operation is somewhat like the periscope of a submarine.
 Ail you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of
 others. To all those, I would like to say thank you very much. CAPCOM 11, this is Houston. We're getting
 a good picture of Buzz now, but no voice modulation. And would you open up the F-stop on the TV
 camera, try 22, please? That appears to be a lot better now. We're still not receiving
 Buzz's audio. ALDRIN Good evening. I'd like to discuss with you
 a few of the more symbolic aspects of the flight of our mission, Apollo 11. As we've
 been discussing the events that have taken place in the past 2 or 3 days here on board
 our spacecraft, we've come to the conclusion that this has been far more than 3 men on
 a voyage to the moon, more still than the efforts of a government and industry team,
 more even than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the
 insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown. Neil's statement the other day
 upon first setting foot on the surface of the moon, ""this is a small step for 
 a man, but a great leap for mankind,"" I believe
 sums up these feelings very nicely. We accepted the challenge of going to the moon. The acceptance
 of this challenge was inevitable. The relative ease with which we carried out our mission,
 I believe, is a tribute to the timeliness of that acceptance. Today, I feel we're fully
 capable of accepting expanded roles in the exploration of space. In retrospect, we have
 all been particularly pleased with the call signs that we very laboriously chose for our
 spacecraft, Columbia and Eagle. We've been particularly pleased with the emblem of our
 flight. Depicting the US eagle, bringing the universal symbol of peace from the Earth,
 from the planet Earth to the moon, that symbol being the olive branch. It was our overall
 crew choice to deposit a replica of this symbol on the moon. Personally, in reflecting the
 events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind to me. ""When I considered
 the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the moon and the stars which Thou hast ordained,
 what is man that Thou art mindful of Him."" ARMSTRONG The 
 responsibility for this flight lies first
 with, history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort. Next to the
 American people, who have through their will, indicated their desire. Next to four administrations
 and their congresses, for implementing that will, and then to the agency and industry
 teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU,
 the spacesuit and back pack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would
 like to give a special thanks to all those Americans who built those spacecrafts, did
 the construction, the design, the tests, and put their, their hearts and all their abilities
 into those crafts. To those people, tonight we give a special thank you, and to all the
 other people that are listening and watching tonight, God Bless you. Good night from Apollo
 11. PAO This is Apollo Control, 179 hours 9 minutes
 Ground Elapsed Time. During the past half hour there have been some exchanges between
 the spacecraft communicator Bruce McCandless here in Mission Control and the crew of Apollo
 11. One item they're trying to sort out and troubleshoot some difficulties with the biomedical
 sensors attached to the chest of Command Module Pilot Mike Collins. Let's play back
 the accumulated tape and hopefully by the time it's ended, we will have picked up communications
 again and we'll rejoin the conversation live. Roll tape please. Houston, Apollo 11. Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over. SC Roger, I was in a thruster firing activity.
 We're about ready to crank up PTC if you are. CAPCOM Roger, go ahead. SC Okay, thank you. COMMTECH Go ahead. Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over. Go ahead, Houston. CAPCOM 11, we'd like you to shift to an OMNI
 antenna configuration at the present time. We're requesting the S-band antenna OMNI switch
 to Bravo and S-band antenna OMNI switch to OMNI. The high gain antenna track in MANUAL,
 pitch minus 50, yaw 270. Over. SC Roger. I'll do that right now. CAPCOM Roger, and if Mike has a minute, we'd
 like to do a little bit of troubleshooting. It seems that he's either flat-chested or
 something because we've lost respiration rate on the biomed telemetry. That is, the ZPN
 trace down here is flat. SC He was shaving a little bit ago. He might
 not be finished. Hold on one. SC The whole blasted wires are connected is
 all I know. CAPCOM Okay, Mike. We had a request that you
 disconnect the yellow connector from the signal conditioner and verify that it looks okay,
 reconnect it and then if you would check the two electrodes that is placed one on each
 side of your lower ribcage. Over. SC Okay, there's a smile on Charles Worth's
 face now. CAPCOM Cliff is not on right now. Gene Kranz
 just relieved him a few minutes ago. SC Roger that. SC All those wires and things look all right
 here. CAPCOM Roger, Mike. We could see variations
 on our traces. You've connected and disconnected, but the medics still don't have a signal.
 Looks like you're sending us a message of some sort. SC Well, I promise to let you know if I stop
 breathing. Apollo 11, Apollo 11, this is Houston broadcasting
 in the blind. Request OMNI BRAVO. Request OMNI BRAVO. Over. Apollo 11, this is Houston. Communication
 reestablished. SC (Garbled) CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Will you
 confirm you're in OMNI BRAVO? Over. SC Okay, that ought to give it to you. CAPCOM Roger. Out. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Mike, we're
 still getting a flat trace on you for the impedance anemograph. Before you turn in this
 evening you might try putting some fresh paste in the sensors and if that doesn't
 work the medics have agreed to forget about it. Over. SC Mike is out of the loop right now. I'll
 convey him the message. CAPCOM Okay, thank you. Houston, Apollo 11. Say again. CAPCOM Roger, Mike. The trace on your respiration
 rate is still flat. If you have time this evening before turning in, we would suggest
 that you try putting some fresh paste in the two electrodes that go on the side of your
 lower rib cage, and if that doesn't work just give up on it. SC Out. This is Apollo Control. Columbia now 85,198
 nautical miles out from earth, approaching earth at a velocity of 6443 feet per second.
 Still standing by for resumption of air to ground communications  which may be difficult in as much as CAPCOM
 is leaving the room. We'll continue to monitor air to ground as the crew prepares for their
 pre-sleep checklists, sets up the passive thermal control mode and sacks out for about
 a 10-hour rest period in preparation for tomorrow's entry and subsequent recovery in the mid-Pacific
 aboard the carrier Hornet now hove-to on the aiming point or near the aiming point. Standing
 by at 179 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control. PAO This is Apollo Control. 180 hours 25 minutes
 ground elapsed time. We have some 4 minutes accumulated tape in recent transmission between
 Columbia and the ground. We'll roll these tapes at this time. SC (sound of train) CAPCOM Hey 11, this is Houston. You might
 tell Buzz not to exercise quite so strenuously. Over. SC What's the problem? CAPCOM Say again. SC What's the problem? CAPCOM Okay, that's one on us. 11, Houston.
 Seriously, that comment was just aimed at your musical selection. SC Okay. (sound of train) Come on, Neil, not
 so fast. (sound of train) You have an ergometer up here. CAPCOM What was that? Realtime exercise? SC Just trying to be your ergometer. CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM Apollo 11, this is Houston. Over. SC Go ahead, Houston. CAPCOM We'd like to know what your plans are
 as far as turning in this evening. In our flight plan we show you coming up to a rest
 period at about 182 hours and what are you planning to do on that? We're going to be
 watching the weather here and we expect to have an update on the weather, I guess, in
 about half hour or 45 minutes to pass to you. Over. SC We’re going to probably stick with the
 flight plan pretty much. We are going to check the flights in the northwest corner of the
 US and southwest corner of Canada, if we can see up that high in the northern hemisphere.
 Other than that, we'll be on the flight plan. CAPCOM Roger. For your information, the laser
 from McDonald Observatory in West Texas will be up from about 181 hours and 30 minutes,
 on for 1 hour. You should be able to spot the Earth out of the number 1 window every
 time you pass roll 357 degrees and I add, of course, you're in West Texas. Over. SC Okay, thank you. How about the number 5
 window? CAPCOM Stand by a minute. CAPCOM Roger. For the number 5 window. That'll
 be every time you pass 2230 degrees in roll. Over. SC Beautiful. Thank you. You guys are on your
 toes down there. CAPCOM Roger. SC You have a new, new star chart. You must
 have a new, new star chart, huh? CAPCOM Oh, we got a fresh, fresh FAO, here. CAPCOM Honeysuckle, Houston. Contact net 1
 voice check. HSK Honeysuckle, read you loud and clear. CAPCOM Roger. Read you the same. SC Houston, Apollo 11. How much longer do
 you want to keep charging battery B? CAPCOM 11, this is Houston. Nominally we're
 looking for about another hour and a half, but what we'd like to do is continue charging
 until shortly before you turn in for the night. Over. SC That'll be fine. Are you going to want
 to charge A again at all? CAPCOM Negative, 11. SC Okay. CAPCOM Eleven, this is Houston. About 180:45,
 we'll be handing over from Goldstone to Honeysuckle and I’m handing over to Charlie. See you
 when you get back, over. SC Okay, Bruce, good night, thank you. SC Thank you very much, Bruce, it's been a
 pleasure working with you. CAPCOM Have a nice trip down. PAO This is Apollo Control. The weird noise
 has been reported by network controllers as not being on the downlink from the spacecraft.
 Now it's stopped. Let’s leave the circuit open here in the period prior to the time
 the crew goes to sleep and monitor the air ground circuit. PAO This is Apollo Control. We've been standing
 by now for quite some time for resumption of communications but apparently no one is
 saying anything tonight. Apollo 11 now 78,134 nautical miles out from Earth approaching
 at 6785 feet per second. And at 181 hours 17 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. This is Apollo
 Control. FAO This is Apollo Control. We've had one
 brief communication from Apollo 11. Spacecraft Communicator Bruce McCandless is out of the
 room. The Assistant Flight Director Chuck Lewis went down to the console to talk. Let's
 play that tape back and rejoin live when the conversation picks up again. SC Roger, Houston. For retro I have the anticipated
 location of all the entries stowage and I suggest you pull out the entry checklist and
 we'll go through those maps in the front of it. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Could you stand
 by just a few minutes? Charlie and flight are out getting a weather briefing. They're
 be back shortly. SC Say again? CAPCOM Say again? SC Is this Owen? CAPCOM No, It’s Chuck Lewis. Charlie Duke
 is out with flight getting a weather briefing right now. SC Okay. They’re out drinking coffee, I
 know. CAPCOM They'll be back momentarily. PAO I stand corrected. That's Charlie Duke
 on the CAPCOM slot. Bruce McCandless in the last half hour has been relieved. Charlie
 is likely to respond. Now he's putting on his headset. We'll listen in. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Over. SC Roger, Houston, Apollo 11. Did you get
 the word on the entry checklist? CAPCOM Roger, Mike. We sure did. We're ready
 to talk about it, if you are. Over. SC I think the quickest thing is go through
 page by page, the first part of the entry checklist where it has a map. Starting on
 the page with compartment L2 and L3. Are you with me? CAPCOM Roger. With you. SC Okay. L2 is as shown. L3 is as shown, there
 is about half the food remaining in L3. CAPCOM Roger. SC Where it says ""and note"" the CMP PGA is
 located in the L-shaped bag with the other 2 PGAs. The LM shield was jettisoned with
 the, correction, the CMP's helmet shield was jettisoned with the LM and his helmet and
 gloves instead of being in the sleep restraint are in the hatch bags. CAPCOM Okay. Let's see now. Your PGA is in
 the L-shape bag with the other two PGAs and your helmet and gloves are in the L-shape
 bag instead of the sleep restraint. SC The helmet and gloves are in the hatch
 bag, the great big bag that's underneath the left hand couch that you put the hatch in. CAPCOM Rog. I thought I, that's what I copied.
 Okay. Go ahead. SC Okay, the next page is identical except
 nitpicking point. At R 1 we got the entry check list. Other than that it is identical
 and the third page has got some changes. CAPCOM Go ahead. SC In A 1, are you with me? I'm over there
 in compartment A 1. CAPCOM Go ahead, Mike, over. SC In compartment A 1, the 16 millimeter magazine
 will be located in window number 04 instead of 05. Tissue dispensers, there’s only one
 of them left. In compartment U 3 the 16 millimeter bracket is on window 04 and the PGA bag add
 the CMPs PGA plus add 2 LPGs. In compartment A 8, delete 2 LPGs, add 1 TPK making a total
 of 4 and add 10 pounds of LM miscellaneous equipment. We told you 5 the other day. We
 think 10 is probably closer. Over. CAPCOM Copy. SC That's all the changes on that page. Ready
 for the next page? CAPCOM Rog, go ahead, Mike. SC On your next page in compartment B 1, we
 estimate about 15 percent of that food is remaining. In B 2 we took PPK and put trash
 in it. In B 3 the 16 millimeter cable, the 18 millimeter lens and the right angle mirror
 are on window number 04 and that's, that brings you all up-to-date. CAPCOM Roger, how about the levers, Mike?
 Where did you put those, over? SC They're in the hatch bag. CAPCOM Roger. Standby, our only concern, 11,
 is with the stuff you got in the hatch bag. That's pretty big bulk between you and AA
 and we'd like to talk about moving that over to the sleep restraint. If you will standby
 I'll verify that, over. SC Okay. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Our recommendation on
 the gear you got in the helmet bag, correction the hatch kit bag, would be to remove that
 stuff and put it in the sleep restraint on the right couch. The reason is that the hatch
 bag traps are only configured for zero g and it is a pretty difficult job getting it latched
 down. With the gear in the sleep restraint, it's a pretty standard latch down procedure
 and you could also use the beta cord that you have onboard. You concur? Over. SC Yah, we'll look at it Charlie, and let
 you know. CAPCOM Roger, and I got a couple of other
 things, Mike. We need to terminate battery B charge at this time and also the weather
 is clobbering in at our targeted landing point due to scattered thunderstorms. We don't want
 to tangle with one of those so we are going to move the - your aim point up-range, correction,
 it will be downrange, to target for 1500 nautical mile entry so we can guarantee uplift control.
 The new coordinates are 13 degrees, 19 minutes north, 169 10 minutes west. The weather in
 that area is super. We got 2,000 scattered, 8,000 scattered with 10 miles visibility and
 6 foot seas and the Hornet is sitting in great position to get to that targeted position,
 over. PAO This is Apollo Control. To recap briefly
 the conversation a few moments ago between Charlie Duke and the crew of Columbia. Because
 of forecast thunderstorms in the prime recovery area in the mid-pacific for tomorrow the Apollo
 Spacecraft’s lifting capabilities will be used to stretch the entry path some 215 nautical
 miles farther down range toward Hawaii to a new landing point or aiming point with the
 very rough preliminary coordinates of 13 degrees 19 minutes north by 169 degrees 10 minutes
 west. These numbers will be refined through the night as the retrofire officer exercises
 the computer and comes up with more definitive numbers. These will be passed on as they are
 available. Apollo 11 now 75,951 nautical miles out from Earth approaching at 6999 feet per
 second. At 181 hours 50 minutes and standing by on the air ground circuit this is Apollo
 Control. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston, some of the general
 last minute updates here. On the entry, we had told you on the camera to set it at 50
 feet. It turns out the biggest number on the camera is 25 feet so just set it at
 infinity, over. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We're ready
 to put you to bed and say good night if you give us your crew status report and verify
 that you chased out the C02 canister a moment ago. Over. SC Stand by. SC Okay, Charlie. Crew status report follows.
 CDR 11023, CMP 10025, LMP 09027. Canister change complete. CAPCOM Roger. Thank you very much there. SC No medication. CAPCOM Roger. Thank you. Could you give us
 the onboard readout, please, sir? SC Stand by. Okay, Bat C 37, Pyro Bat A 37,
 Bat B 37, RCS A 51, D 63, C 62, D 58. CAPCOM Roger. Copy. Thank you much. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. It's good night
 from the white team for the last time. We'll be off when you wake up in the morning. It's
 been a pleasure working with you guys. It was a beautiful show from all three of you.
 We appreciate it very much and we'll see you when you get out of the LRL. Over. SC Okay, Charlie, thanks to you and all the
 white team for a great job done there all the way through. Thank you. SC Outstanding. SC Thank you very much, Charlie. Thanks. CAPCOM Thanks to you guys, too. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Mike, you get your chance
 at landing tomorrow. No go around. SC Roger. You're going to let me land closer
 to Hawaii, too, aren't you? CAPCOM That's right, sir. PAO This is Apollo Control. All good nights
 having been said, the crew of Apollo 11 is now preparing to get their 10 hours rest and
 their last night in space. Here in the Control Center one of the 10 by 10 Eidophor television
 projectors, a drawing has been projected on the screen ribbing Capcom Charlie Duke for
 his slight error yesterday on the television pass where he mistook the moon for Earth.
 It has the spacecraft midway between the moon and Earth and it says, ""Neil, I just spotted
 a continent on the moon. Charlie, the camera's on the Earth now."" Apollo 11 now 74,906 nautical
 miles out from Earth approaching at 6954 feet per second. And at 182 hours, 6 minutes Ground
 Elapsed Time, this is Apollo Control. PAO This is Apollo Control. 182 hours 10 minutes
 ground elapsed time. We thought that was all the air-to-ground for tonight prior to the
 crew going to sleep, but just a few moments ago, there was a brief exchange reporting
 to Apollo 11 crew that the McDonald Observation in far West Texas had the spacecraft in their
 telescope field of view. Let's roll that tape now and then shut it down again. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We got some word just
 a moment ago that the McDonald Observatory is, said they had picked up the spacecraft
 in their telescope. Over. SC Outstanding. We have been looking for their
 laser for - but haven't had much luck yet. CAPCOM Roger. We'll pass it on to them, Neil.
 Thank you. PAO This is Apollo Control. That completes
 the very brief exchange of a few moments ago. At 182 hours 11 minutes Ground Elapsed Time,
 this is Apollo Control. PAO This is Apollo Control, 183 hours, 25
 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. Columbia spacecraft, now 69,520 nautical miles out from earth approaching
 6-, as you were, 7,262 feet per second. Crew now in their rest period, started their sleep
 period a little over an hour ago. To reiterate the change in landing point, this is a weather
 avoidance situation where thunderstorms are forecast for the aiming point, the original
 aiming point in the mid-Pacific. Therefore, after the normal entry interface the lifting
 characteristics of the Apollo Command Module will be used to extend the entry range some
 250 nautical miles farther down range toward Hawaii to a preliminary aiming point, that
 is the aiming point may shift around between now and entry which is some 11 hours, 36 minutes
 from now. But at any rate the aiming point as calculated now is some 13 degrees 19 minutes
 north latitude by 169 degrees 10 minutes west longitude. The preliminary time of drogue
 decline is 195 hours, 12 minutes. As you were, yes, 195 hours, I2 minutes, 4 seconds and
 the net extension over the earlier splash time is something like 40 seconds. At 183
 hours, 27 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. This is Apollo Control. PAO This is Apollo Control at 185 hours 29
 minutes Ground Elapsed Time. 9 hours 33 minutes until entry. Crew is still asleep at this
 time, scheduled to wake up at 189 hours Ground Elapsed Time, some 3? hours from now. We've
 had no word from the crew since the scheduled sleep period began. Apollo 11 now 61,034 nautical
 miles out from the Earth and velocity of 7815 feet per second. At 185 hours 30 minutes Ground
 Elapsed Time. This fs Apollo Control. PAO This is Apollo Control 186 hours 28 minutes
 Ground Elapsed Time. 8 hours 35 minutes to entry. Crew of Columbia still asleep at this
 time. Some 2? hours away from wakeup time at 189 hours Ground Elapsed Time. Because
 of weather avoidance in the prime recovery zone in the mid-Pacific, southwest of Hawaii,
 it has been decided some time ago to shift the landing point or aiming point some 215
 nautical miles downrange from the pre-mission aiming point. And all the numbers concerned
 with entry and post-entry events have been generated and we shall forward them at this
 time. Pencils ready? Command Module-Service Module separation, 94:48:07 Ground Elapsed
 Time, 11:20:08 Central Daylight Time; entry interphase, that's 400 000 feet above the
 Earth's surface, Ground Elapsed Time 195:03:07, 11:35:08 Central Daylight Time; begin blackout,
 195:03:25 Ground Elapsed Time, 11:35:26 Central Daylight Time; 05G, 195:03:35 GET, 11:35:36
 CDT; end of blackout, 195:06:56 GET, 11:38:57 CDT; drogue parachutes deploy, 195:12:04 GET,
 11:44:05 CDT; main chutes deploy, 195:12:52, 11:44:53 CDT; touchdown, 195:17:49 GET, 11:49:50
 CDT. Maximum G-loading to be pulled during the entry phase will be 6.12 Gs. Entry velocity,
 that's at entry interphase of 400,000 feet, will be 36,194 feet per second. Flight path
 angle, minus 6.5 degrees. Aiming point location, 13 degrees 19 minutes north latitude, 169
 degrees 09 minutes west longitude. At 186 hours 32 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this
 is Apollo Control. PAO This is Apollo control 187 hours, 28 minutes
 ground elapsed time. 7 hours, 34 minutes to entry. Flight surgeon Ken Beers reports that
 all three crew members are sleeping soundly at this time. Their sleep period will and
 probably at 189 hours although they may sleep an additional hour to 190 hours. Spacecraft
 being tracked now through the Guam station. A line projected out from Earth to what is
 called a sub-satellite point or a point directly under the spacecraft would put it over dead
 center of Australia. At 187 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapsed Time, this is Apollo control. PAO This is Apollo Control 188 hours, 28 minutes
 Ground Elapse Time. Apollo 11 now 46,254 nautical miles out from Earth. Velocity continuing
 to increase, now 9081 feet per second. There will be a dramatic increase in velocity as
 the spacecraft gets closer in. Here in Mission Control Center the entry team headed up by
 Flight Director Milt Windler is beginning to come aboard. Hand over in progress from
 Gene Kranz white team. The crew is still asleep at this time. They're some 6 hours, 34 minutes
 from entry interface. And at 188 hours, 29 minutes Ground Elapse Time, this is Apollo
 Control. PAO This is Apollo Control at 188 hours 43
 minutes. Mid-course correction number 7 has been cancelled and we will add one hour of
 rest time to the flight plan. Crew will be awakened at 190 hours elapsed time. To repeat,
 we have cancelled midcourse correction number 7 and we will allow the crew to sleep until
 190 hours elapsed time. This is Mission Control Houston. PAO This is Apollo Control at 189 hours 28
 minutes. Apollo 11 is 40,961 nautical miles from the Earth, approaching at a velocity
 of 9,671 feet per second. Midcourse correction number 7 has been cancelled and as a result
 we will let the crew sleep until an elapsed time of 190 hours. Weather in the recovery
 area, well, we're getting a call from Apollo 11, now. Let's listen to that. SC Roger. What's the status on midcourse 7?  CAPCOM Roger. We were going to let you sleep
 in until about 190 hours. Midcourse 7 is not required. SC Okay. Thank you. PAO The crew gave us a call at 189 hours,
 29 minutes. We advised them of the cancellation of the midcourse correction. Weather in the
 recovery area, skies will be partly cloudy. Cloud base is at 2000 feet scattered. Wind,
 east northeast at 18 knots, 6 foot sea, temperature 80 degrees. This landing area is 215 miles
 to the northeast from the original landing area, moved because of thunder showers in
 the original area. This new location should allow the recovery ship USS Hornet to arrive
 in Hawaii 4 to 5 hours earlier than originally planned. We expect that it may be possible
 for the carrier to arrive at Pearl Harbor somewhere between 8 and 9 o'clock on July
 26. That's Saturday. PAO The crew is probably preparing breakfast
 now and it's not likely we'll hear a lot from them right away, but we'll continue to stay
 up alive for any conversation."

I see a lot of footage look at that footage necessarily accurate so far you're on a magic studio this is a sound studio as we were saying this is directed by Martin Scorsese all right here and here's the Photoshop how many hundred sixteen years ago was that fifty years right so if we were making that level of progress 50 years mm-hmm this is when people barely were watching television when it was not in colored black and white okay okay this was segregation was taking place in our country you're what makes you think that we were not on the moon where's the progress okay Jalen I went on a cruise once you know I'm not doing again going on cruise they went up to the moon put a flag up been down there I make the return trip there's an individual walk in the face of the earth selling real estate on the moon okay and what makes it worse is there are people that are buying it what makes it works.this people like you that don't believe that human beings have been there before when they have the footage it happened it's a major accomplishments a major part of our history first and foremost I applaud the great people of NASA and all of the individuals that take time and energy to press the boundaries of what we see you're calling all dated liars you're calling all those people liars all that I'm saying is I need to see more information then the footage of it's no but guess what you know what those great people of NASA do you just disrespected look at some bars for you they got some bars for usually they got some bars for you here's what my man Alan boodle said he said we have hundreds of pounds of moon rock stored there and the Apollo mission control center Houston during his visit talking about staff he can see firsthand what we did 50 years ago as well as what we're doing now to go back to the moon in the coming years but this time to stay stop it okay Alan you call my man Alan a liar look at the camera call Alan a liar again I dare you I love you Alan I'm not calling you a lot yes you are I'm just saying that there's a reason why he study astrology and I study mass communications like I don't a stroller see astrology oh yeah astronomy okay okay

 was hanging in there around 100 the latter part of the burn. It started oscillating a
 little bit and got down a little bit below 100. CAPCOM Roger. SC 96 or so. CAPCOM Roger. PAO Most of the conversations so far has been
 from Neil Armstrong and Mike Collins. That last comment came from Collins. Our first
 report after acquisition was from Neil Armstrong. That trans-earth injection burn was very close
 to nominal. At this time we show the spacecraft traveling at a speed of 7,603 feet per second.
 The velocity already beginning to drop off and we're at an altitude of 445 nautical miles
 now from the moon. This is Apollo Control. We now show the spacecraft traveling at 7,378
 feet per second. Altitude 568 nautical miles. The next order
 of business will Director, Gene Kranz, requested his flight controllers, prior to acquisition
 of signal to review their procedures and to take as many steps as possible to get the
 crew to sleep as soon as possible. There will be a press conference in the Building 1 auditorium
 and we estimate the time on that at about 12:30 Central Daylight Time. And our LM telecommunications
 engineer reports that we've just had acquisition of signal from Eagle which is still in lunar
 orbit. The last fix that we had on Eagle's orbit showed an apogee of 64. 1 and a para,
 apocynthion rather of 64. 1 and a paracynthion of 64.4 nautical miles. The spacecraft altitude
 is now climbed to almost 700 nautical miles from the moon. We show a weight of 26,510
 pounds, about 10,000 pounds less than what we had actually about 1100 or 11,000 pounds
 – let’s correct that - about 10,100 pounds less than what we had prior to the transearth
 injection burn. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Would you give
 us PU and accept. We've got a REFSMMAT for you/ Over. SC Okay. CAPCOM Thank you. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. We've got
 the load in. You can go back to block. Over. SC Your command module sound seems to be working
 out pretty well, Charlie, the amount we carried. Looks like we carried just about what we needed. CAPCOM Wonderful. SC We have one 16 millimeter roll on the ASA
 1000 color interior film. We were thinking of shooting that during entry window number
 4 on bracket and try and get the camera guide sometime in the last couple of days. Give
 us all a good time for that. CAPCOM Roger. PAO This is Apollo Control. The flight dynamics
 officer reports that the burn very nominal, almost precisely as planned, the burn duration
 was about 3 seconds long, but the velocity change was almost precisely what we had been
 expecting. At the present time, Apollo 1t is 1076 nautical miles from the moon. The
 velocity continuing to drop off, down now to 6698 feet per second. PAO This is Apollo Control at 136 hours, 44
 minutes. Apollo 11 is now 3,720 nautical miles from the moon and traveling at a speed of
 5,367 feet per second. During the press conference we accumulated about 4 minutes of taped conversation
 with the crew. The crew reports at this time that they are completing taking pictures and
 they are getting ready to realign their guidance system platform. We'll pick up the tape conversation
 and then stand by for any following live communications with the crew. We anticipate that they will
 be shortly beginning their pre-sleep checklist in preparation for a well-deserved rest period. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. I wondered
 if during the TEl burn you utilized the oxidizer flow valve on the valve on the PUGS? Over. desiring increase for the whole time since
 we started out with it in increase and I saw that we pretty quickly crossed the line and
 started falling about 6 or 7 percent behind. So I was still expecting it to move up and
 then I went down to full decrease and brought it back down to a difference
 of 2 percent. Over. CAPCOM Roger. Thank you very much, Buzz. SC 2 tenths of a percent, I'm sorry. CAPCOM Right. Thank you. Apollo 11, Houston.
 You can go to PTC attitude and torque at your, and do the P52 and torque at your convenience.
 Over. SC Hey, we got to take some more pictures,
 Charlie. Is there any constraint normally in staying here for a while? CAPCOM No sir. SC Thank you. CAPCOM Go ahead 11. Over. SC How does that tracking look or is it too
 early to tell? CAPCOM Stand by, Mike.
 CAPCOM FIDO's are looking at the data. It's too early to tell yet exactly. It's looking
 real good so far. We'll have you some answers shortly on trajectory. Over. SC Yeah. What FIDO is it? CAPCOM Jay Green. SC Howdy Jay. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We have a DAP CSM update
 for you. SC Go ahead. CAPCOM Rog. That CSM weight, Mike, 26370.
 Over. SC Thank you, sir. CAPCOM You're welcome. Apollo 11, Houston.
 We've taken your onboard vector and propagated it for you and it's looking real good. We
 only got about 24 minutes tracking now and it’s really too early to tell on the radar.
 Over. SC Roger, I understand. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Mike, did
 you notice any transients at ignition on TEI? Over. SC Yah. The transients are more noticeable
 than on previous burn, Charlie. I just wrote it off on the fact that we had a light command
 module but there was considerable roll activity which dampened down after the first 20 seconds,
 I would guess, after the burn but then there was also some pitch and yaw activity. I don't
 believe it was abnormal and seemed to be deadbanding fatherly crisply in roll plus or minus about
 8 degrees inside the center line and after the first couple of, oh, after the first 20
 seconds or so the gimbals were quiet and pitch and yaw were relatively quiet. Before that
 there was some oscillation but mostly just in rates-total attitude hung in there pretty
 well. CAPCOM Roger. Thank you very much. We were
 looking at the playback and we saw some things that rather stood out. We'll be back with
 you later on that. SC Okay. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Have you finished
 taking pictures? Over. SC We're just finishing up, Charlie. CAPCOM Roger. SC We'll get started on the P52 here pretty
 soon. CAPCOM Copy. SC (Garbled). PAO This is Apollo Control. That brings us
 up to date with the taped conversation. We'll stand by for any further live communication
 from the crew before they begin their sleep period. We've gotten some preliminary figures
 from the Flight Dynamics Officer on that transearth injection burn after a review of the telemetry
 data and it shows that our change in velocity was nominal 3,283.5 feet per second. We also
 show a nominal burn time of 2 minutes, 28 seconds. The crew reported the burn time about
 2 to 3 seconds long based on their onboard data. The ground data shows the burn to have been just about nominal.
 Based on the preliminary tracking it would appear that the splash down would occur almost
 precisely as predicted or planned in the flight plan. That would be at 195 hours 18 minutes
 40 seconds ground elapse time. And we would expect that splash down time to change somewhat
 during the transearth coast particularly as the need or lack of need for midcourse correction
 becomes more apparent with additional tracking. At this time Apollo 11 is 4,086 nautical miles
 from the moon traveling at almost precisely 1 mile per second, 5,283 feet per second,
 and that's just updated 5,280 feet per second. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. You can crank
 up on the PTC at any time. Over. SC Thank you. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. SC Go ahead, Houston. CAPCOM Rog, 11. This is the regional CAPCOM.
 Congratulations on an outstanding job. You guys have really put on a great show up there.
 I think it's about time you power down and got a little rest though you've had a mighty
 long day here. Hope you're all going to get a good sleep on the way back. I look forward
 to seeing you when you get back here. Don't fraternize with any of those bugs in route
 except for the Hornet. SC Okay. Thank you boss. We’ll, we're looking
 forward to a little rest and a restful trip back and see you when we get there· CAPCOM Right. You've earned it. PAO That exchange was between Donald K., Deke,
 Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations at the Manned Spacecraft Center and astronaut
 Nell Armstrong. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like
 you to turn off 02 tank number 1 heaters. Over. SC It's off. Thank you. CAPCOM Rog. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. For your
 information, the LGC in Eagle just went sailing up about 7 hours. Over. SC Okay. It's very good, then (garbled), death
 of a real winner there. Charlie, we're going to rotate about pitch 270 degrees on the way
 home vice 1 - or 090 on the way out. Right? CAPCOM Right, sir. SC Okay, We're reporting in a maneuver to
 that attitude is in progress. CAPCOM Rog. SC Houston, this status report Radiation CDR
 11017, CMP 10019, LMP 09020. No medication. CAPCOM Say again, please, Neil. You were breaking
 up. We missed that. Over. SC Okay. This is crew status report. Radiation
 CDR. 11017, CMP 10019, LMP 09020. No medication. CAPCOM Roger. Thank you. And we didn't get
 any crew status report from you this morning. Wondered if you could give us an estimate
 of sleep last night. Over. SC (Garbled) Okay. I'll take a guess at 10,
 11 and try to give us (garbled)….CDR 3 and LMP 4. CAPCOM Roger. Thank you very much. SC And Charlie, you want the (garbled) cycling,
 right? CAPCOM That's affirmative and we'd like you
 to disable our quads Charlie and Delta. Over. CAPCOM Apollo i1, Houston. If it's convenient,
 we'd like to go through your onboard readout. Over. SC Of what? CAPCOM Oh, excuse me. It's on the flight plan
 3102. We'd like to have Bat send RCS. Over. SC Ready to copy it? CAPCOM Roger. Go ahead. SC That's Charlie 370, pyro bat A 370, bat
 B 370, RCS 55, 65, 64, and 62. Over. CAPCOM Roger. We copy all that. Thank you
 much. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. A couple of questions
 for the moon walkers, if you got a second. Over. ARMSTRONG Go ahead. CAPCOM Roger, Neil. We're seeing some temperature
 rises on the passive seismic experiment that are a little higher than normal and were wondering
 if you could verify the deployed position. We understand it is about 40 feet from the
 LM in the 11 o'clock position B. Over. ARMSTRONG No, it's about in the 9 or 9:30
 position and I'd say it's about 50 or 60 feet. CAPCOM Roger. Copy. Also did you notice, was
 there any indication of any dust cloud as you lifted off? Over. ARMSTRONG Not very much. There was quite a
 bit of Kapton and parts of the LM that went out in all directions and usually in the same
 distance as far as I can tell, but I don't remember seeing anything of a dust cloud to
 speak of. CAPCOM Roger. I understand all you could see
 was parts of the LM going out. What was your first comment? Over. ARMSTRONG I don’t remember. Just say Kapton
 and other parts of the LM of staging scattering all around the area for great distances but
 I didn't see dust. CAPCOM Right. Thank you very much. PAO This is Apollo control at 137 hours, 27
 minutes. At this time, Apollo 11 is traveling at a speed of about 4982 feet per second.
 At about 5900 nautical miles from the moon, and about 198 900 nautical miles from earth.
 A short while ago, you heard Neil Armstrong make a few descriptive comments of the scene
 on the lunar surface at the time the planned ascent stage lifted off. Armstrong reported
 seeing very little dust, but quite a bit of debris from the LM. He referred to the Kapton,
 which is a plastic-like insulation material generally silver or gold in color which is
 found on the outside surface of the LM. And, we also had a report at 136 hours, 54 minutes,
 about 40 minutes or so ago, that the LM guidance computer had finally stopped putting out any
 data, and that was about 7 hours, 13 minutes after the primary guidance system was deprived
 of the coolant, in a test of how the system would continue to operate without coolant.
 The platform apparently begin to become unusable after about 4 hours and the computer itself
 finally gave up after about 7 hours and 13 minutes. Both items going considerably, considerably
 longer than had previously been predicted. The lunar module ascent stage still in lunar
 orbit. We are continuing to get data from it. Ail other systems appear to be functioning
 well at this time. The LM orbit we show is currently 64.4 nautical miles for height of
 apocynthion, 54.4 nautical miles for pericynthion. And the LM is in its 23rd revolution, and
 here's a call to the crew. CAPCOM Over. SC Thank you, Charlie, and I think we'll bring
 you up to date on our chlorination status. In compartment B4, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
 6, 7 - correction - we have 8 pockets for chlorine and buffer ampules of which - let
 me correct that. We have 7 pockets of which one is empty and always has been empty, leaving
 6 remaining. In the other side, over there in the BT, we have another container with
 7 pockets, so we have a total of 7 plus 6 and those are filled with 6 chlorines and
 7 buffers. Now I've been using one chlorine and one buffer per day which, at this point
 and time, prior to this chlorination I'm about to do, leaves me one chlorine and two buffers.
 Seems to me I'm one chlorine short, and that being the case, I'd like to ask your advice
 on postponing this chlorination using the last container until some later date like
 maybe tomorrow. Over. CAPCOM Roger. We copy, Mike. Stand by. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Check in
 A1, Mike, and see what you can find in there. Over. We think you might have some more chlorine
 up in Al. Over. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. Apollo 11,
 Houston. Do you read? You're breaking up. Over. SC Roger. We hear. CAPCOM Roger, 11. You're breaking up. Mike,
 please look in component Al. We think there might be some more chlorine up there. Over. SC Eureka! CAPCOM 11, Houston. Reading you about 1 by.
 Over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We're having a
 downlink problem, the reason we can't read you. We're switching sides. Stand by. Hello
 Apollo 11, Houston. How do you read now? Over. SC Fine. CAPCOM Rog. You're 5 by on that too, Mike.
 Thank you much. Did you copy that about Al on that chlorine? SC Eureka! CAPCOM How about that, sports fans? CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We're having a
 little trouble getting the yaw rate damped out to the appropriate value. We'd like you
 all to be quiet like mice for a couple of minutes and let's see if that’ll help it
 out. Over. CAPCOM 11, Houston. You did great work there.
 We're ready to spin it up. Over. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Did you copy? Over. SC Yes. We read you, Charlie? Would you stand
 by a minute? CAPCOM Roger. No hurry. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Shift change time here.
 White team bids you good night. We'll see you tomorrow. Over. SC Okay, Charlie. Thank you. SC Night, Charlie. Thank you. SC Adios. CAPCOM Adios. Thanks again, for a great show,
 you guys. SC Thanks for a great show down there. PAO This is Apollo Control at 137 hours 52
 minutes. Apollo 11 crew has signed off for the night, starting a well-deserved rest period.
 Duration of the rest period is programmed for 10 hours, however, the wake up time is
 not critical. It's very likely that we'll let them sleep ‘til they wake up of their
 own accord. At this time Columbia is 7,045 nautical miles away from the moon, headed
 toward home at a velocity of 4,868 feet per second. PAO This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 02
 minutes. CAPCOM Owen Garriott has just put in a call to the crew and is passing up some
 antenna information to them. Here's that conversation. CAPCOM Howdy there, Mike. We're ready to go
 ahead and have you put your OMNI position for your sleep period, and we would like the
 following high gain put positions: your high gain antenna in MANUAL, beam was WIDE, pitch
 is minus 50, and yaw is a plus 270 and just follow the flight plan for remaining comm
 configuration. Over. SC Roger. (garbled)…pretty hard. CAPCOM Your comm is pretty weak at this point,
 Mike. Please say again. SC Roger. (Garbled). PAO That coming at 137 hours 55 minutes elapsed
 time. At that time the battery power fell below the level where the secondary guidance
 system could hold the attitude of the vehicle within the steerable of antenna limits. We
 do not expect to establish contact with Eagle again. We'll continue to stand by here live.
 There may be a bit little more conversation before the crew turns in for the night. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We'd like for you
 to go ahead and put on S-Band antenna OMNI to OMNI and OMNI B. Over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. How do you read
 me through Honeysuckle now? Over. SC You're loud and clear. Over. CAPCOM Very good. Reading you better now and
 did you copy we'd appreciate going S-Band OMNI and OMNI B at this time? Over. SC Roger. (Garbled). CAPCOM Okay, thank you. SC (Garbled). PAO This is Apollo Control at 138 hours 11
 minutes. We do not intend to contact the crew during this rest period again. We will take
 this lying down now and come back up if there is further conversation. This is  Mission Control, Houston."

 you repeat your burn status report. We copied the residuals and burn time and that was about
 it. Send the whole thing again please. SC It was like, it was like perfect. DELTA

 trim, minus 6.8 on DELTA VC, fuel was 38.8, OX 39.0 plus 50 on balance,
 we ran an increase on the PUGS, NOUN 44, show us in a 60.9 by 169.9. CAPCOM Roger. We copy your burn status report. CAPCOM We’re getting a beautiful picture
 in down here now 11. The color’s coming in quite clearly and we can see the horizon
 and the outer blankness of space and without getting into the question of grays and browns
 it looks, at least on our monitor, sort of a brownish/gray. SC (garbled) the way they’re describing
 it. It appears to me as though it made a difference just sitting back in the, in the tunnel and
 gazing at all windows, it makes a difference which one you’re looking out of. For example,
 the camera right now is looking out the Number 5 window and it currently gives a rosier or
 tanner tinge, especially when you look straight through it and not, not at an angle. Over. CAPCOM Roger. Yah, the crater that’s in the center of
 the screen now is Webb. We’ll be looking straight down on it at about six minutes before
 power descent. It has a relatively flat bottom to the crater and you can see maybe two or
 three craters that are in the bottom of it. On the western wall, the wall that’s now
 nearest to the camera, near the bottom of the screen, we can see dimples there just
 on the outside. And then coming back towards the bottom of the screen and to the left,
 you can see a series of depressions. It’s this type of connective craters that give
 us most interest to, to discover why they’re in the particular patterns that they’re
 in. I’ll zoom the camera in and try to give you a little closer look at this CAPCOM Roger. We’re observing the dimpled
 crater now. The central peak that we can see on the orbital photos doesn’t seem to stand
 out very well here. SC They’re not central peaks. They’re
 depressions in the center. SC Eagle, Houston, we look good through the
 210. We’re going to shift data select to an 85 foot dish to see what we got and then
 we’ll be back to you on the 210 if you’ll stand by in a couple of minutes in this mode,
 we’ll be back with you. Over. CAPCOM Roger, Eagle. Standing by. PAO This is Apollo Control Houston. 83 hours

 well satisfied with the communications check on the lunar module and will proceed with
 powering down the spacecraft. At 83 hours 27 minutes, we now read an altitude of 54.3

 dump to 25 percent at 84 hours. CAPCOM Roger. And Mike, we'll have LOS in
 about 11 minutes at 83:44. AOS is 84:30, and prior CAPCOM to - or at LOS, we would like
 you to go configure the S-band for high gain track to react, high gain beam to narrow,
 and let's try that to see if we can get an automatic react at the next AOS.
 Over. COLUMBIA Good idea. PAO That was Mike Collins, aboard Columbia,
 taking down a maneuver pad. COLUMBIA Rog. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Also that water

 PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston. 83 hours 34 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11.
 The lunar module communications has been deactivated. We currently show a velocity of 5,377 feet

 of loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. At the present time, our velocity reading,
 53 hundred and 75 feet per second. Our total weight in orbit at this time, reading 70 thousand
 500 and 2 pounds. Our orbital parameter's epilune is 65.1 nautical miles perilune 54.2
 nautical miles. This is Apollo Control, Houston. PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston at 83
 hours 43 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Less than a minute away from predicted
 time of loss of signal with the Apollo 11 spacecraft. We expect the next time we acquire
 Apollo 11, its crew, Nell Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz Aldrin, will have begun
 their rest period. And at 83 hours 43 minutes this is Apollo Control,
 Houston. PAO Apollo 11 has passed out of range with
 the ground, traversing now over the far side of the Moon. During this pass, we had an extremely
 successful communications checkout with the lunar module using its code name for the first
 time. Its code name of the Eagle. Buzz Aldrln performed the counting tasks in concert with
 Charlie Duke, the capsule communicator here on the ground, and at times Buzz's – Buzz’s
 voice, we noted considerable enthusiasm for the way things are going, and at times Charlie
 Duke shared that enthusiasm and its maiden checkout in communications, the lunar module
 Eagle, looked good. At 83 hours 45 minutes, this is Apollo Control, Houston. PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston, at 84
 hours and 28 minutes now into the flight of Apollo i1. We're less than 2 minutes away
 now from our scheduled time of acquisition with Apollo 11. Meanwhile in Mission
 Control Center, Astronaut Owen Garriott has now replaced Charlie Duke as our Capsule Communicator.
 We expect that some final advisories will be passed to the Apollo 11 crew, and final
 report says such as crew status will be received from Nell Armstrong, Mike Collins, and Buzz
 Aldrin prior to the start of their sleep period. A little over - we're a little over a minute
 away now from scheduled time of acquisition. We'll continue to keep the line-up and continue
 to monitor. This is Apollo Control, Houston. PAO Mark 30 seconds now from time of scheduled
 acquisition. PAO Mark 20 seconds. 10 seconds. We should
 be acquiring shortly and we're standing by. PAO We have data - we've acquired data on
 Apollo 11. PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston. Owen
 Garriott getting ready to place a call. CAPCOM Over. SC Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Roger. Reading you fine,
 and it looks like the automatic REACT went very well just because-you came around the
 LM. We have several small items to discuss with you here just before you go to sleep.
 Over. SC Go ahead. Over. CAPCOM Okay, 11. First of all, on our LM systems
 checks. Everything went fine. I would like to remind you though tomorrow you may see
 an ascent pressure light when you activate the MC and W. There should be no problem,
 however. You did note that the AP - OP tank pressure was only reading 111 psi, which is
 normal at this point, but the below the level which will trigger your light due to the helium
 which has been dissolved into the propellant. Over.SC Roger. Understand that. Thank you. CAPCOM Roger. And next item, the supercritical
 helium rise rate is nominal, and you also had that question for us about your thruster
 activity during the P22 on the last REV. Believe we understand that now, and you reported that
 your pitch was in ACCEL COMMAND and your yaw and roll were in REG COMMAND. You were firing
 your pitch thrusters that will couple REG into your yaw and roll axes, and the - you
 were at that time holding only half a degree deadband and coupling REG's into yaw and roll
 produced the extra firings about the yaw and roll axis. Over. SC Yes, that may be true. It's very peculiar
 coupling in that it waits longer than you would think and its reaction is greater than
 you would think. We were getting yaw rates of around four tenths of a degree per second
 per panel. CAPCOM Roger, Mike. We did play the data back
 and that's the way it looked upon analysis of the chart recordings back here. Over. SC Okay. Fine. They’ve looked at the results
 of your feedback tracking. The marks all apparently were very good and we've got a full page of
 data here relative to the altitudes of the various track locations, which I won't read
 up to you, but I did want to let you know that the marks apparently went very well.
 I also have your consumables budget, particularly your RCS propellant quantities. They're Deltas
 from nominal if you should want them. Your work quad is quad Charlie, which is 9 percent
 low. I'll not read up the others unless you want them. Over. SC Okay, I got the 02 fuel cell purge. You
 want them now? CAPCOM I'll have to standby. Just a moment. SC Okay. And then the other one is we're still
 charging battery A. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We would like to delay
 the fuel cell purge until the back side of the moon, and you go ahead and - should terminate
 your battery charge at this time. Over. SC Okay; understand, I knew we had another
 O2 and H2 purge coming up in the morning, I wasn't sure whether you wanted to go through
 with this one or not. I'll wait until the next side and then do it. CAPCOM That's fine, Buzz. SC Terminate battery charging now. CAPCOM That's right and one other systems
 item here - in order to balance your cryo tanks, would you get your 02 and tank 1 and
 your H2 tank 2 heaters off? Over. SC Okay, I have O2 tank heater I off, and
 H2 tank heater 2 off. CAPCOM That's right, Mike, and we believe
 you have your quad Bravo and quad Charlie turned off in your DAP at this time, and a
 5 degree deadband. We'd prefer a 10 degree deadband for your sleep period overnight
 here. Over. SC Okay. CAPCOM One Other item relative to a malfunction
 procedure. It's unlikely that you'll have to worry about this tomorrow, but in your
 malfunction list under docking on page Fll-9 there is a malfunction procedure for
 a high 02 flow rate at the top - under tunnel at the top of page 11-9. We would like to
 have you not use that malfunction procedure should you encounter the high 02 flow rate,
 and instead check back with Houston for a revised procedure should you find that situation.
 Over. SC Understand and note has been made in my
 checklist. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Roger. That just about
 takes care of all the items we have here on the ground before time to hit the sack, and
 I guess you will have a pre-sleep check for us before you go to bed. SC Roger. We're in the midst of cycling the
 02 and H2 fans now. CAPCOM Roger. SC And the radiation is as follows: CDR 11012
 CMP 10013 LMP 09015. Negative medication, over. CAPCOM Roger, copy 11. PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston. 84 hours
 39 minutes now into the flight. That conversational exchange with Owen Garriott - here in Mission
 Control Center and principally Buzz Aldrin; however, Mike Collins did talk briefly about
 Program 22, the landmark tracking activity in which he performed. At 84 hours 40 minutes,
 this is Apollo Control, Houston. SC Hey, Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM 11, Houston, go ahead. SC Roger. We're thinking about taking the
 monocular with us on into the LM. We think it might prove to be of some use, over. CAPCOM Roger, Buzz. It sounds like a good
 idea for some of your surveying work there inside the cockpit, over. SC Okay, you want to run that by whoever might
 be concerned. CAPCOM I sure will. PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston. 84 hours
 44 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. Our current spacecraft altitude is now 64.3
 nautical miles with an apolune 65.2 nautical miles; perilune 54.4 nautical miles. We show
 an orbital period of one hour 58 minutes 40 seconds on our displays. Current weight of
 the spacecraft in orbit 70,502 pounds. At 84 hours 44 minutes,
 continuing to monitor, this is Apollo Control, Houston. PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours,
 48 minutes now into the flight. We're receiving noisy data at this time. We've requested Apollo
 11 to give us a manual relock. Standing by at 84 hours, 49 minutes this is Apollo Control,
 Houston. SC Houston, Apollo 11. How do you read now? CAPCOM 11, Houston. Loud and clear this time.
 OMNI. SC Loud and clear. You faded out on your other
 transmissions. Over. CAPCOM Roger. Are you in wide-beam now? SC Negative, but I've got you locked back
 on again REACQING now. CAPCOM Roger. That's all we want. We want
 to stay in narrow and-we're a little puzzled about why we lost you here a few minutes ago.
 Do you have any ideas? SC Sure don't. We're showing the background
 - 15 degrees for the pitch and about 270. That ought to be good and clear. CAPCOM We concur that. We still don't have
 any good ideas on why we were lost. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Would you confirm that
 we did acquire automatically when you came around the LM for this passage. Over. SC That's confirmed. CAPCOM Thank you. PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston 84 hours,
 56 minutes are now in the flight of Apollo 11. Our current apolune 65.1 nautical miles,
 current perilune 54.3 nautical miles. After receiving some noisy signal, Apollo i1 has
 locked back on in fine form. That was Buzz Aldrin speaking with Owen Garriott here in
 the Mission Control Center. I expect we will take a second look at why we had to lock on
 manually. As we receive any updates on we'll pass them along. We now read 84 hours,
 57 minutes and this is Apollo Control, Houston. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston, over. SC Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM Eleven, Houston, on your RCS select
 switches, we show quad Bravo disabled but quad Charlie only partially disabled. Charlie
 3 I believe, is the only one you have selected off, is that correct? SC Roger, that's correct. CAPCOM Rog · PAO This is Apollo Control Houston at 85 hours
 5 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. We confirmed from the ground, following that
 conversation exchange. As was pointed out CAPCOM We see them all disabled at this time,
 thank you. PAO As was pointed out, quad, RCS quad Charlie
 is now disabled following that conversational exchange between Owen Garriott and Buzz Aldrin.
 Buzz, the lunar module apparently, quite obviously still awake. 85
 hours 7 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11 now continuing to monitor, this is Apollo
 Control, Houston. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston, over. SC Go ahead Houston. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We're going to try to
 check out this ability to automatically reacquire on the S-band and what we want to do is to
 secure our uplink carrier for about 30 seconds, then we will turn it back on and see if the
 spacecraft equipment will automatically reacquire. So if you do not get a call from us within
 about 3 minutes, that means we have not been able to reacquire and request your assistance
 on a manual acquisition, over. SC Okay, we understand. CAPCOM 11 Houston, we also would appreciate
 if you will note the angles that the antenna tracks through in its attempt to reacquire,
 over. SC Roger, we'll do that. CAPCOM 11, Houston. It looks like we're locked
 back up again with no delay. How does it look on board? Over. SC Roger. The signal strength dropped very
 rapidly to zero and the pitch and yaw, in about 3 seconds, moved towards 40 degrees
 pitch and 240 degrees yaw. Right now, we’re setting on about 15 degrees
 pitch and roll about 265 degrees yaw. So they didn't move very far, oh, about 30 degrees
 apiece and then they picked right back on up again. Over. CAPCOM Roger. Some of the luckiest people
 in the background there. We copied your pitch and yaw angles. CAPCOM 11, Houston. You give us the location
 of your pitch and yaw location of your position indicators. Over. SC Roger. They're in the same position as
 the antenna right now, about 15 degrees pitch and - no, wait a minute. I got them - got
 it at about 75 instead of 265. CAPCOM Okay, thank you. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We'd like to try the same
 procedure once more. We'll leave the carrier a little longer and be back up for a call
 within 4 minutes. Over. SC Okay. PAO This is Apollo Control, Houston. At 85
 hours 17 minutes now into the flight of Apollo 11. What you heard in the conversation between
 Owen Garriott and Buzz Aldrin was following a communications check in which
 we secured the uplink carrier for some 30 seconds and waited to give it a period of
 time of approximately 3 minutes, to see if the spacecraft would reacquire. We appeared
 to reacquire in fine form on this first test. We will repeat it - this test a second time,
 delaying approximately 4 minutes before we place a call to Apollo 11. At 85 hours 17
 minutes, we currently read an altitude - spacecraft altitude of 56.1 nautical miles. Present velocity
 shows 5,367 feet per second. At apolune 65 nautical miles, perilune 54.4 nautical miles.
 Present weight in orbit remains a static 70,502 pounds. Present time in orbit as shown on
 our displays, 1 hour 58 minutes 40 seconds. This is Apollo Control, Houston. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We're locked back up again.
 Can you give us a report on how the antenna behaves? SC Roger. it was essentially identical as
 before. The pitch went to 45, 40 to 45 and then the yaw went to about 255, 245 to 255
 and then it rather quickly locked up at 15 degrees pitch and 270 yaw. Over. CAPCOM 11, Houston. Roger. Your angles of
 45 and 255. Do I understand that as soon as the carrier dropped, it went to these angles,
 or did it only go to these angles after the uplink carrier was re-enabled and the antenna
 began to reacquire? Over. SC No. As soon as the carrier dropped off,
 why it drifted over into those angles and stayed there. Then when it came back up again,
 why it hunted around for a while, but it didn't get any further off, gradually brought it
 on in to the angles where it is right now, and they the signal strength, would take several
 jumps as evidently it goes from wide to medium to narrow. CAPCOM 11, Houston. I understand, and on another
 subject, request you zero your optics for the night. Over. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Over. SC Houston, Apollo 11, go ahead. CAPCOM The Black Bugle just arrived with some
 morning news briefs if you’re ready? SC Go ahead. Ah, Roger. Okay. Church services around the
 world today are mentioning Apollo 11 in their prayers. President Nixon’s worship service
 at the White House is also dedicated to the mission and our fellow astronaut, Frank Borman,
 is still in there pitching and will read the passage from Genesis which was read on Apollo
 8 last Christmas. The Cabinet and members of Congress, with emphasis on the Senate and
 House Space Committees, have been invited along with a number of other guests. Buzz,
 your son, Andy, got a tour of MSC yesterday. Your uncle, Bob Moon, accompanied him on the
 visit which included the LRL. Among the… Roger. Among the large headlines concerning
 Apollo this morning is one asking that you watch for a lovely girl with a big rabbit.
 An ancient legend says a beautiful Chinese girl called Changho has been living there
 for four thousand years. It seems she was banished to the moon because she stole the
 till of immortality from her husband. You might also look for her companion, a large
 Chinese rabbit, who is easy to spot since he is always standing on his hind feet in
 the shade of a cinnamon tree. The name of the rabbit is not reported. Okay, we’ll keep a close eye for the bunny
 girl. Roger. You residents of the spacecraft Columbia
 may be interested in knowing that today is Independence Day in the country of Columbia.
 Gloria Diaz of the Philippines was crowned Miss Universe last night. She defeated 60
 other girls for the global beauty title. Miss Diaz is 18 with black hair and eyes and measures
 34 ½, 23, 34 ½. First runner-up was Miss Australia followed by Miss Israel and Miss
 Japan. While you’re on your way back Tuesday night, the American and National League All
 Stars will be playing ball in Washington. Mel Stadlemeyer of the Yankees is expected
 to be the American League’s first pitcher. No one is predicting who will be pitcher for
 the National League yet. They have nine on the roster. Even though research has certainly
 paid off in the space program, research doesn’t always pay off, it seems. The Woodstream Corporation,
 parent company of the Animal Trap Company of America, which has made more than a billion
 wooden spring mousetraps reports that it’s built a better mousetrap but the world didn’t
 beat a door to it, didn’t beat a path to its door. As a matter of fact, the company
 had to go back to the old fashioned kind. They said, “We should have spent more time
 researching housewives and less time researching mice.” And the Black Bugle is all completed
 for the morning. Thank you very much. We appreciate the news. Our black team will be looking for an interesting
 day with you all tomorrow. Roger, we’ll be going off here shortly and… Apollo 11, this is Houston, over."

 second for shadow photography on the sequence camera. ALDRIN Okay.
 ARMSTRONG I'm at the foot of the ladder. The LM foot pads are only depressed in the surface
 about 1 or 2 inches. Although the surface appears to be very, very fine grained, as
 you get close to it. It's almost like a powder. Now and then, it's very fine. ARMSTRONG I'm going to step off the LM now. ARMSTRONG That's one small step for man. One
 giant leap for mankind. ARMSTRONG As the, the surface is fine and
 powdery. I can, I can pick it up loosely with my toe. It does adhere in fine layers like
 powdered charcoal to the sole and sides of my boots. ALDRIN …making sure not to lock it on my
 way out. ARMSTRONG Particularly good thought. ALDRIN That's our home for the next couple
 of hours and I want to take good care of it. Okay, I'm on the top step and I can look down
 over the RCU, landing gear pads. That's a very simple matter to hop down from
 one step to the next. ARMSTRONG Yes, I found it to be very comfortable
 and walking is also very comfortable. You've got three more steps and then a long one. ALDRIN Okay, I'm going to leave that one foot
 up there and both hands down to about the fourth rung up. ARMSTRONG There you go. ALDRIN Okay. Now I think I'll do the same. ARMSTRONG A little more. About another inch.
 There you got it. That's a good step. About a three footer. ALDRIN Beautiful, beautiful. ARMSTRONG Isn't that something. Magnificent
 sight down there. ALDRING Magnificent definition. ARMSTRONG For those who haven't read the plaque,
 we'll read the plaque that's on the front landing gear of this LM. First there's two
 hemispheres, one showing each of the two hemispheres of the Earth. Underneath it says, "" Here Man
 from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon, July 1969 A.D. We came in peace
 for all mankind."" It has the crew members' signatures and the signature of the President
 of the United States. CAPCOM Tranquility Base, this is Houston.
 Could we get both of you on the camera for a minute, please? ARMSTRONG Say again, Houston. CAPCOM Roger. We'd like to get both of you
 in the field of the view of the camera for a minute. CAPCOM Neil and Buzz, the President of the
 United States is in his office now and would like to say a few words to you. Over. ARMSTRONG That would be an honor. CAPCOM Go ahead Mr. President, this is Houston.
 Out. PRES NIXON Neil and Buzz, I am talking to
 you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House. And this certainly has to be
 the most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are
 of what you have done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives.
 And for people all over 
 the world, I am sure they, too, join with Americans, in recognizing what a feat this
 is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as
 you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to double our efforts to bring
 peace and tranquility to earth. For one priceless moment, in the whole history of man, all the
 people on this earth are truly one, one in their pride in what you have done. And one
 in our prayers, that you will return safely to Earth. ARMSTRONG Thank you, Mr. President. It's a
 great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the United States but
 men of peace of all nations. And with interest and a curiosity and a vision for the future.
 It's an honor for us to be able to participate here today. PRES NIXON And thank you very much and I look
 forward, all of us look forward to seeing you on the Hornet on Thursday. ARMSTRONG Thank you. ALDRIN I look forward to that very much, Sir. ARMSTRONG Thank you. I’m open now. ALDRIN Now you’re clear. You’re rubbing
 up against me a little bit. ARMSTRONG Okay? ALDRIN Allright. That’s right. Next the
 left. You want to move your foot and I’ll get the hatch. ARMSTRONG Okay. ALDRIN Okay, the hatch is closed and latched.
 And we’re up by it secure. CAPCOM Columbia, Columbia, this is Houston.
 Over. COLUMBIA Roger, Columbia to Charlie. How do
 you read? CAPCOM Roger, Columbia. This is Houston. We're
 reading you loud and clear on OMNI Charlie. The crew of Tranquillity Base is back inside
 their base, repressurized and they're in the process of dopping the PLSS's. Everything
 went beautifully. Over. COLUMBIA Hallelujah. CAPCOM And we'd like to get POO and accept
 from you. We have a state rector up light. And, after that, we'd like you to realign
 your platform to the new F marker we sent up a rev or two ago. Over. ARMSTRONG Alright. Understand. You want an
 option 1, 82 option 1. PAO This is Apollo Control. Dr. Charles Berry
 reports that heart rates during this EVA period ranged from a low of 90 for both crewmen to
 a high of about 125 for Buzz Aldrin for 2 periods. And, a high of 160 for Nell Armstrong
 at 3 periods. That top reading coming during the time he was transferring the rock boxes
 into the LM. Dr. Berry says the data they got indicates Nell Armstrong was working very
 hard at that time. CAPCOM Columbia, this is Houston. Over. TRANQUILITY Houston, Tranquility Base. Go

 way of showing a configuration of the engine arm circuit breaker? Over. The reason I am
 asking is because the end of it appears to be broken off. I think we can push it back
 in again. I'm not sure we could pull it out if we pushed it in though. Over. CAPCOM Roger, we copy. Standby please. CAPCOM Tranquility Base, this is Houston.

 those dosimeter readings have not changed since yesterday afternoon indicating that
 the crew was not subjected to radiation on the surface of the moon or if any a very negligible
 amount. COLUMBIA Houston, Columbia. Over. CAPCOM Columbia, this is Houston. Go ahead. COLUMBIA Roger, Bruce. When you get a few
 minutes could you give me some words on tomorrow’s activities, when they're going to start? CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM Columbia. Columbia. This is Houston.
 Over. CAPCOM Columbia. This is Houston. Over. COLUMBIA Go ahead. CAPCOM Roger, Mike. Couple of quick flight
 plan updates here. First off, we'd like to get an 02 fuel cell purge at time 113:30.
 Are you copying? Over. COLUMBIA Roger. Copy. CAPCOM Secondly, we will return to the nominal
 time life with your scheduled wake up of 121 hours and 12 minutes. We sort of slipped by
 the lithium hydroxide canister change number 9 during the EVA and EVA prep, and we'd like
 you to accomplish that now. The comm per sleep will be the normal lunar comm configuration.
 The RCS configuration, we're requesting that you use quad Alpha and Bravo. A data load
 for R2 should be 01111. Read back. Over. COLUMBIA Roger. Oxygen in fuel cell purge
 at 113:30. Return to the nominal time line at 121 hours. Wake up. Lithium hydroxide change
 number 9 right now. Normal lunar comm sleep configuration, I'm in that n6w. On the RCS
 I understood before you wanted to move the dap register to 011000 which made sense on
 (garble) to pitch only on quad A enable all in quad B to C and D off, but you don't want
 to do that any more, huh? CAPCOM Columbia. This is Houston. On your
 dap load in R2, we were requesting 0 and 4 ones. That is 01111. Over. COLUMBIA Okay. ….doing it right now. CAPCOM Roger. And you'll be enabling quads
 Alpha and Bravo on the LORCS select, which is disable Charlie and Delta. COLUMBIA Got it. CAPCOM And we have a little less than 2 minutes
 to LOS. If you're still up, LOS next time around will be 11404. Over. COLUMBIA Roger. CAPCOM And Columbia, if it's agreeable with
 you, we'd like for you to stay awake until we have one successful acquisition on the
 high gain antenna, and I guess you can plan on turning in shortly after LOS in this next
 pass. Over. COLUMBIA Copy. CAPCOM Roger. Out. CAPCOM Tranquility Base. Tranquility Base.
 This is Houston. Radio check. Over. TRANQUILITY Go ahead. Houston. CAPCOM Reading you loud and clear. Just wanted
 to make sure we had comm. TRANQUILITY We've just finished up, we’re
 just finishing up our eat period. Be ready to go back into prep for press. CAPCOM Roger. PAO This is Apollo Control at 113 hours, 18
 minutes. We have had loss of signal from Columbia. We have asked Mike Collins to stay awake through
 acquisition on the next rev which will be number 20 so that we can check the automatic
 acquisition mode of the high gain antenna. Once we've verified that, he will start his
 rest period. The planned wake up for command module pilot 121 hours. PAO This is Apollo control. We're estimating
 the change of shift news briefing for 2:00 A.M. central daylight time. 2:00 A.M. central
 daylight time for the change of shift briefing. PAO This is Apollo Control at 113 hours 29
 minutes. The change of shift news briefing is about to start. We will tape any air-ground
 transmissions during this period for playback after the briefing. If the equipment jettison
 occurs during the briefing, we will come back up and provide that for you live. CAPCOM (Garbled.) This is Houston. Over. EAGLE Roger. Go ahead, Houston. CAPCOM Roger. On your next depressurization,
 it's acceptable to use the overhead hatch dump valve in addition to or instead of the
 forward hatch dump valve to speed up the depressurization of the cabin. I have a P-13 update for you
 and if you could sometime there give us PU and data, we'll uplink you a new CSM space
 vector. Over. EAGLE You've got the DSKY. CAPCOM Roger. Your P-13 time is 124:22:02.
 Over. EAGLE Roger. It's P-13 124:22. Is that 02?
 Over. CAPCOM That's affirmative. That is 02. And
 do you have a time estimate for us until you're ready to start cabin depress? Over. EAGLE 15 minutes, maybe? CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM Tranquility Base, this is Houston.
 Uplink complete. The computer's yours, and you can go out of data. EAGLE Roger. TRANQUILITY Go ahead. Tranquility Base here. CAPCOM Roger. I guess you guys know that since
 you're an hour and a half over the time line, and we're all taking a day off tomorrow, we're
 going to leave you. See you later. TRANQUILITY I don't blame you a bit. CAPCOM It’s been a real great day, guys.
 I really enjoyed it. TRANQUILITY Thank you. You couldn't have enjoyed
 it as much as we did. CAPCOM Roger. It sure was great. Sure wish
 you'd hurry up and get that trash out of there, though. TRANQUILITY Well, we're just about to do it. CAPCOM Okay. PAO We're live now. The CAPCOM voice on that
 last transmission was Deke Slayton, the Director of Flight Crew Operations here at MSC. CAPCOM Tranquility Base, this is Houston.
 We showed a suit release valve still on the AUTO position. It should be closed. Over. CAPCOM Columbia, this is Houston. Over. COLUMBIA Houston, Columbia. Go ahead. CAPCOM Roger. We've successfully reacquired
 high gain antenna. Unless you have some other traffic with us, I guess we'll bid you a good
 night and let you get some sleep, Mike. Over. COLUMBIA Okay. Sounds fine. CAPCOM And we're going to power down the voice
 subcarrier part of our uplink to you, in order that we don't disturb you while we're talking
 to Tranquility Base. If you need us, just give us a call and we can respond with a time
 lag of about a minute to a minute and a half and get it reconfigured. Over. COLUMBIA Okay. CAPCOM Roger and good night. COLUMBIA Okay and thanks a lot. PAO We said good night to Mike Collins and
 Columbia at 114 hours 6 minutes. And the cabin is coming down now on Tranquility Base. And
 it's down to about 3 ? pounds now and holding that. CAPCOM Columbia, this is Houston. We'd like
 you to enable the thrusters for BRAVO 1 and BRAVO 2. AUTO RCS Select. Over. COLUMBIA BRAVO 1 and BRAVO 2 Enable. CAPCOM Roger. Out. PAO The Tranquility Base pressure coming on
 down now, 1 ? pounds. TRANQUILITY We read the following dump valve
 until about 2 psi and we're using the overhead now. CAPCOM Roger. Out. TRANQUILITY They’re, they're both open now. PAO Less than half a pound of pressure now. CAPCOM Tranquility Base, this is Houston.
 Over. ALDRI N Roger, go ahead. CAPCOM Roger, on your mission timer we wanted
 to pull a circuit breaker and let it cool down for an hour and a half to two hours.
 I believe the breaker is currently open. It has been off so go ahead and reset the mission
 timer circuit breaker. Put the timer control to reset and hold it in reset for 30 seconds
 and then slue it to your desired setting left to right and voice the timer control to start.
 Over. ALDRIN Okay, we’ll try it. ALDRIN Houston, our mission timer seems to
 be sloughing okay. You want to give us a time hack or can we get it off the CMP, LGC I mean? CAPCOM Roger Tranquility. I'll give you a
 time hack at 114:31:00. It's about 30 seconds from now. Over. CAPCOM Standby for a mark at 114:31. Standby.
 Mark. CAPCOM Tranquility, this is Houston. Did you
 copy by mark at 114:317? TRANQUILITY Roger. Thank you, and our mission
 timer is ready now. CAPCOM Roger. Very good. And I've got a consumables
 update for you if you are ready to copy. Over. TRANQUILITY Okay. Go ahead. CAPCOM Okay. RCS alpha is 81 percent, RCS
 bravo 75 percent. Coming up on 115.0 is GET. Descent oxygen is 31.8 pounds or 59 percent.
 Descent amp hours 858 and ascent amp hours 574. Over. TRANQUILITY Roger. Copy. Thank you very much. CAPCOM Roger. Out. CAPCOM Tranquility, this is Houston. We also
 have a set of about 10 questions relating to observations you made, things you may have
 seen during the EVA. We can either discuss a little later on this evening or sometime
 later in the mission. It's your option. How do you feel? Over. TRANQUILITY I guess we can pick them up. CAPCOM Okay, and your friendly green team
 here is pretty well been relieved by your friendly maroon team, and I'll put Ward on
 with the questions. TRANQUILITY Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Go ahead. CAPCOM Tranquility, Houston. First question
 here is your best estimate of the yaw on the, of the LM as compared to the nominal of crew
 flight plan. Over. TRANQUILITY We got 13 degrees left on the
 ball, and I think that's probably about right. Looking at the shadow, so we probably, probably
 about 13 degrees left of the shadow. CAPCOM Roger, that's 13 degrees left of the
 shadow. And next question relates to the depth of the bulk sampling that you obtained near
 the first part of the EVA, and any changes in composition that you might have observed
 during the bulk sampling interval. Over. TRANQUILITY I'm not sure I understand that
 question, but we got a good bit of the ground mass in the bulk sample plus a sizeable number
 of selective rocks of different types. CAPCOM Roger, Neil. One of the implications
 here is the depth from which the bulk sample was selected. Did you manage to get down there
 several inches or nearer the surface? Over. TRANQUILITY We got some down from as much
 as 3 inches in the area where I was looking at (garbled), the variation with depth at,
 with the bulk sample, that there really was an appreciable difference, and I didn't run
 into any hard bed. Later on, other types and other areas where I get down just a short
 distance, an inch or two, and couldn't go any further. CAPCOM Roger. Believe we understand down as
 deep as 3 inches, did not hit any hard bed, and no significant changes in composition
 to that depth. Next question, the second SRC was packed rather hurriedly due to the time
 limitations and wonder if you would be able to divide any more detailed description of
 the samples which were included in the second SRC. Over. of assorted rocks which I picked hurriedly
 from around the area, tried to get as many representative types as I could. CAPCOM Roger, Neil. Next topic here relates
 to the rays which emanate from the DPS engine burning area. We were wondering if the rays
 emanating from the, beneath the engine are any darker or lighter than the surrounding
 surface. Over. TRANQUILITY The ones that I saw back in the
 back end of the spacecraft appeared to be a good bit darker, and of course, viewed from
 the aft end, well, they did have the sun shining directly on them. It seemed as though the
 material had been baked somewhat and also scattered in a radially outward direction,
 but in that particular area, this feature didn't extend more than about 2, maybe 3 feet,
 from the skirt by the engine. Over. CAPCOM Roger. Understand that near the aft
 end up to the eve, that the rays did appear to be darker. I understand, Buzz, that these
 were, this was the appearance of the material which had been uncovered by the rays that
 appeared darker for 2 or 3 feet extending out. Is that correct? TRANQUILITY No, I wouldn't say it was necessarily
 material that had been uncovered. I think some of the material might have been baked
 or in some way covered to be more cohesive and perhaps go together or something - I don't
 know. Now, in other areas, before we started traveling around out front, why we could see
 that small erosion had taken place in a radially outward direction, but it had left no significant
 mark on the surface other than Just having eroded it away. Now, it was different back
 in the, right under the skirt itself. It seems as though the surface had been baked in a
 streak fashion, and I think a couple of pictures on film will show that. But that didn't extend
 very far. Over. CAPCOM Roger, Tranquility. And this baked
 appearance is great concern that you described, at least the suggestion is that it was due
 to the heat of the engine at any rate. Next subject, did… TRANQUILITY I believe so. CAPCOM Roger. Next subject, did either of
 the solar panels on the PSE touch the surface of the moon during deployment? Over. TRANQUILITY I think that two corners did touch
 just when it was deployed but both of them did come out at the same time. It unfolded
 a little unevenly and of course the crane that it was on was a little bit, not quite
 as level as it was, as I would like to have it. I think that two corners did touch to
 about 1 inch, 3/4 to 1/2 an inch deep and maybe along the bottom, it might have been
 maybe 3 inches leaving a small triangular coating on two of the corners and I think
 these are on the western ones. Over. CAPCOM Roger. Understand the description and
 the next subject on the 2 core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required
 to collect the two core tubes which you collected, how did the driving force required to collect
 these tubes compare? Was there any difference? Over. TRANQUILITY Not significantly. I could get
 down to about the first 2 inches without much of a problem and then as I would pound it
 in about as hard as I could do it and the second one took 2 hands on the handle and
 I was putting pretty good dents in the top of the extension rod and it just wouldn't
 go much more than - I think the total depth might have been about 8 or 9 inches. But even
 there it didn't, for some reason, it didn't seem to want to stand up straight. In other
 words, I'd keep driving it in and it would dig some sort of a hole but it wouldn't , just
 penetrate in a way that would support it and I'd keep it from falling over if that makes
 any sense at all!. It didn't really to me. Over. the two samples and that in each case you
 got down about 2 inches without any problems and then had to continuing hammering rather
 vigorously in order to continue driving it into a total depth of 8 or 9 inches and even
 at that point the rods did not want to stay vertical, that they'd tend to fall over on
 you even after pounding in that far. Is that I noticed when I took the bit off that the
 material was quite well packed, a good bit darker, and it, the way it adhered to the
 cord tube gave me the distinct impression of being moist. Over. CAPCOM Roger. I understand the general impression
 of being moist as packed in the cord tube. Next question. We did copy your comments prior
 to the EVA of your general description of the area. We wonder if either of you would
 have any more lengthy description or more detailed description of the general summary
 of the geology of the area. Over. TRANQUILITY We'll postpone our answer to that
 one until tomorrow, okay? CAPCOM Yes indeed. That will be fine. Just
 a couple more here and I think these may not be quite as lengthy as number 7 there. Can
 you estimate, estimate the strokes of the primary and secondary struts? Over. TRANQUILITY Well, I could do it like this.
 Owen. About all the struts are about equally stroked and the height from the ground to
 the first step is about 3 feet or maybe 3 ? feet. CAPCOM Roger. Understand, Nell. Next topic.
 Just after landing you pointed out that there was a hill to the west along the plus Z axis
 from the LM. Are there large rocks in that TRANQUILITY No, I don't believe so. I think
 that it's about as level as any other area the final question. You commented, Nell, that
 on your flight to the landing spot you had passed over a football field size crater containing
 rather large blocks of solid rock, perhaps 10 to 15 feet in size. Can you estimate the
 distance to this football size crater from your present position? Over. TRANQUILITY I thought we'd be close enough
 so that when we got outside we could see its rim back there but I couldn't. But I don't
 think that we're more than a half mile beyond it. That is a half mile west of it. CAPCOM Roger, so you estimate your present
 position less than a half mile approximately west of this large crater. Over. TRANQUILITY That's correct. CAPCOM Okay, you all. That takes care of the
 questions from our geologists for tonight and unless you have something else that will
 be all from us for the evening. Over. TRANQUILITY Okay, thank you."
moonlanding,Audio highlights from the second day of the Apollo 11 mission.,Apollo 11 Mission Audio - Day 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keZZ5444sK0,0,18383,151,10,27,keZZ5444sK0,"11, Houston, the definition is pretty good
 on our monitor here. The color's not too (garbled) at least on this set. Could you describe what
 you're looking at, over? SC You're seeing Earth as we see it out our
 left-hand window, just a little more than a 
 half Earth. We're looking at the eastern Pacific
 Ocean and the north half of the, top half of the screen, we can see North America, Alaska,
 United States, Canada, Mexico and Central America. South America becomes invisible just
 off beyond the terminator or inside the shadow. We can see the oceans with a definite blue
 cast, see white bands of major cloud formations across the Earth and can see coastlines. I
 got the Western U.S., San Joaquin Valley, the Sierra Mountain Range and peninsula of
 Baja, California, and can see some cloud formations over southeastern U.S. There's one definite
 mild storm southwest of Alaska, looks like about 500 to a thousand miles and another
 very minor storm showing the south end of the screen near the, a long ways south of
 the equator, probably 45 degrees or more south latitude. We can pick out the browns, the
 browns in the land forms pretty well. Greens do not show up very well. Some green showing
 along the northeastern, northwestern coast of the United States and the northwestern
 coast of Canada. Roger. SC Stay here, world. Hold on to your hat.
 I'm going to you upside down. CAPCOM 11, that's a pretty good roll there. SC Yah, that was pretty sloppy. Let me try
 that one again. CAPCOM You'll never beat out the Thunderbird. SC I'm making myself seasick, Charlie. I'll
 just put you back right-side-up where you belong. CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM 11, Houston. If you could, we'd like
 to see some smiling faces if you could give us some interior views, I'm sure everybody'd
 like to see you. Over. SC Okay, we'll reconfigure the PB for that. CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM Now we're coming in. Can't quite make
 out who that... SC That's big Mike Collins there. SC Right, you got a little bit of, yah, hello
 there sports fans. You got a little bit of me on the center couch and Buzz is doing the
 camera work this time. CAPCOM Roger. SC I'd have put on a coat and tie if I had
 known about this ahead of time. CAPCOM Is Buzz holding your cue cards for
 you, over? SC Cue card have, a no. We have, we have no
 intention of competing with the professionals, believe me. We are very comfortable up here.
 We do have a happy home. There's plenty of room for the three of us and I think we're
 all learning to find our favorite little corner to, to sit in. And, you know, g is very comfortable
 but after a while you get to the point where you sort of get tired of rattling around and
 banging off the ceiling and the floor and the sides so you intend to find a little corner
 somewhere and put your knees up or something like that to wedge yourself in and that seems
 more at home. CAPCOM Houston, roger. Slowly sinking into
 the sack there. SC It's really comfortable. Forgot to give
 Buzz his flashlight back. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Could you give
 the folks a view of your patch on your CWG? Over. SC Stand by. We're going to try to get it
 closer. CAPCOM All right, 11, Houston. We have the
 patch to get temped up through the focus slightly, over. CAPCOM 11, Houston. The scan on the camera
 makes the, that's a little bit better now. The flashlight seems to flicker due to the
 scan on the TV. We can't see the Eagle. Now that's a little bit better, over. If you open
 the F-stop a little bit more, over. SC Over. It's open all the way. We're going
 to have to move Buzz around a little bit. CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM Okay, Apollo 11, Houston. The colors
 are better now. It's coming in. If we could attempt a little bit better focus on it. There
 we go. Our focus is a lot better now. We see the Eagle coming right in on the lunar surface.
 Over CAPCOM That's very good now. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. That's very good
 now. We can see the Earth in the background, Apollo 11, and the Eagle coming in. SC It's probably pretty hard to see the olive
 branches, isn't it? CAPCOM Roger, it is. SC Well, that's what he has in his talons,
 an olive branch. CAPCOM Copy. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. We're really impressed
 with the clarity and the detail that we have in the picture. The colors are, it's really
 an excellent picture now that I'm looking on our monitor which is about 12 seconds before
 the networks can get it out due to the conversion that we have here on our TV converter. We're
 looking at the controls in the flight, the main display console and we can see the DSKY
 up on the panel. Over. SC That would be nice if you could take a
 look at all the circuit breakers, make sure the right ones are in and the right ones are
 out. CAPCOM All right, Big Bubba's watching. SC And we're glad of it. SC You guys sure been doing a good job of
 watching us. We appreciate it. CAPCOM The spacecraft's been beautiful, 11,
 the way, really no complaints at all. Looks, things are really great. SC Can you see this DSKY on the embasy? CAPCOM That's affirmative. It appears that,
 can't quite tell what program when the cut went through. We see you punching in a verb
 35, I think it is. Over. SC Might as well tell the econs or tell the
 G&C's they better hold on to their hat and I'll push the inner button. CAPCOM Roger. We see a real display now. CAPCOM That's a good demonstration of how
 the crew has the interface with the computer talking to the programs and all that we have
 in the computer. SC That's right, Charlie. Sometimes it tells
 us things and sometimes we tell it things and mostly it talks to us. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We just lost our pickup.
 I see we're going back outside now. Over. CAPCOM 11, Houston. You copy? Over. SC Roger, we copy and as we pan back out to
 the distance at which we see the Earth we'll have Apollo 11 signing off. CAPCOM Roger, Apollo 11. Thank you much for
 the show. It's a real good half hour. Appreciate it. Thank you very much. Out. PAO This is Apollo Control. That TV transmission
 lasted about 35 minutes. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. Would you T arrow
 reset on the DSKY please? Over. SC Okay, we should be straightened out now,
 Charlie. Back in POO. CAPCOM Houston, Apollo 11, how do we stand
 on the O2 fuel cell purge? Do you want to go ahead and do that as scheduled in the Flight
 Plan? SC Stand by, 11, over. CAPCOM Okay. SC This is 11, Houston. You can commence the
 O2 fuel cell purge now if you'd like? Over. CAPCOM Okay, fine. SC While Buzz is doing that, I'll change the
 aluminum hydroxide. CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston, over. SC Go ahead, Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM Roger, Buzz. The attitude that we're
 in right now is a convenient one to start PTC in. We'd be satisfied with this attitude
 so we'd like you to disable quads Charlie and Delta and we'll wait about five to ten
 minutes and then we'll establish the PTC, over. SC Roger, disable Charlie and Delta and we'll
 wait before starting PTC. CAPCOM Roger. PAO This is Apollo Control at 34 hours 46
 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently 131,000 nautical miles from Earth, traveling at a speed of
 about 4300 feet per second. During the TV transmission, the crew advised that they may
 possibly be able to take the color television into the lunar module with them tomorrow at
 about 56 hours 30 minutes ground elapsed time. They reported that the cables had been checked
 and appear to be long enough to take them into the lunar module. During the next hour
 or so, the activity here in Mission Control will be revolving about getting the crew set
 up for their rest period and eat period as we have a very long rest period tonight scheduled
 ten hours and that will begin, according to the flight plan, at about 37 hours ground
 elapsed time. However, we would anticipate if activities move along as they appear to
 be at this point, we are somewhat ahead of the flight plan, then perhaps again we would
 be able to get the crew into their rest period and sleep period a little bit early. At 34
 hours 48 minutes, this is Apollo Control Houston. PAO This is Apollo Control at 35 hours 13
 minutes. Apollo 11 is presently about 93,265 nautical miles from the moon and with respect
 to the moon it's traveling at a speed of about 4019 feet per second. At this time we are
 receiving the tape playback which Goldstone, the tracking site at Goldstone, California,
 received from the spacecraft in that earlier unscheduled TV transmission. This was a test
 of the system using the spacecraft on the antennas, the small OMNI directional antennas.
 Normally transmissions from this distance would be, would require the high gain antenna.
 This television transmission is being processed and converted to color and we anticipate that
 we'll have it available for playback at about 9:00 p.m. We are in conversation with the
 spacecraft at this time and we'll pick up the tape recorder conversation that we 
 have and then standby to follow any live conversation. SC Houston, would you say again what your
 requested? CAPCOM Roger, 11, we'd like you to go back
 to attitude HOLD, over. SC Roger CAPCOM 11, Houston, looks like we're going
 to have to reinitialate, reinitialize this PTC. SC All right. SC Okay, do you have any roll angle that you'd
 like to stop it in, Charlie? I haven't stopped it yet. CAPCOM 11, Houston, it's your preference,
 right now if you want to right now. Over. SC Okay. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston, over. SC Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM Roger, 11. The problem on that initial,
 starting up the PTC was we failed to do the VERB 49 which, and load the desired initial
 attitude, so they are trying to take it back to the old attitude that we had started up
 in a number of hours ago. That's why we picked up the rates in the other axis. We're going
 to wait in this attitude for about twenty minutes to damp out the rates again and then
 we'll proceed with the VERB 49 in LOAD 1 attitude that we have at this time. Over. SC Okay, sounds good, Charlie. When you get
 to the VERB 49, I'd like for you to give me the 3 gimbal angle that you want loaded. CAPCOM Roger, we'll do, over. SC Thank you. CAPCOM And, Apollo 11, Houston, we have your
 fly-by pad if you're ready to copy. Over. SC Standby 1. SC Houston, Apollo1, is that P-30 pass? CAPCOM That's affirmative. Over. SC Okay, ready to copy. CAPCOM All right, Buzz. It's fly-by, it's
 a purpose. SPS G&N. 62815 plus 097 minus 020 070 54 5944 minus 00028 plus 00023 plus 00069

 I copy, I read 029, over. SC Roger, 029. CAPCOM Roger, good readback. SC Houston, Apollo 11. On the 7/10th rate,
 the rate loaded into the dap is 1 or 2/10th. CAPCOM 11. Roger. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston, over. SC Houston, Apollo 11, over CAPCOM Roger. Mike, would you please copy
 down your VERB 16 NOUN 20. I see the angles now. Then execute a VERB 49 and load that,
 those angles, the NOUN 20 that you see on the DSKY into the VERB, into the NOUN 22 slot
 and prone and that will start our 20 minute wait through it. Over. SC Okay, Charlie, I'll do that right now in
 a matter of inches. Those numbers are plus 04511 plus 09021 and plus 35984. Over. CAPCOM Roger. SC It's Apollo 11. I've done that and, of
 course, I got an immediate 50 18 so I guess we're set up to proceed from here and they'll
 start the 20 minute timer. CAPCOM That's affirmative. SC Houston, I still question that 7/10th rate
 with 2/10th loaded into the damper up here, though. Could you explain? Over. CAPCOM Roger, we're working on it. Standby
 1. SC Okay. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston, over. SC Yes, Apollo 11. CAPCOM Roger, we got a little laser experiment
 we like to -- for you to do for us -- If you got the Earth through any of your windows
 or through the telescope, would you so advise? Over. SC Standby, Charlie. At this low attitude
 what should our high gain angles be? Maybe that would help us locate you. We don't see
 you on the lens. CAPCOM Standby. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Those high
 gain angles are PITCH minus 70, YAW 90. We think the Earth is apparently it's pretty
 close to plus C axis, over. SC Okay. SC Okay, Charlie. I got you in the telescope. CAPCOM Roger, Apollo 11. We got a laser that
 we're going to, it's a blue/green laser that we're going to flash on and off in a frequency
 of on for a second, off for a second. It's coming out of MacDonald Observatory near El
 Paso which is, should be right on the terminator, right inside the terminator. We're going to
 activate that momentarily. Would you please take a look through the telescope and see
 if you can see it? Over SC Telescope or sextant? CAPCOM Either one, over. SC Okay, I'll start with the telescope and
 if I don't see it there then I'll try the sextant. CAPCOM Roger. We'll give you the word when
 they've got it turned on, over. SC Okay. CAPCOM 11, Houston. They don't have it turned
 on yet. We'll give you the word when they got it turned on, over. SC Okay. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. We noticed
 the cryo pressure dropped moment ago. Did you stir up the cryos? Over. SC Roger, we've finished cycling operations. CAPCOM Rog, copy, out. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. MacDonald's
 got the laser turned on Would you take a look? Over. SC Okay, Charlie. CAPCOM It's bluish/green. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We got some shaft and
 trunnion that might tweak it up a little bit. Shaft of 141.5. Trunnion of 39.5, over. SC Okay, standby. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. If you see it,
 it should be coming up, appear to be coming up through the clouds. MacDonald reports that
 there's a break in the clouds that they're beaming this thing through. Over. SC Roger. CAPCOM Hello Apollo 11, Houston. You can terminate
 the exercise on the laser. Rates are steady enough now for it to come into the PTC, over. SC Okay, Houston. Neither Neil nor Mike can
 see it. Incidentally those shafts and trunnions just missed pointing at the world. CAPCOM Roger, thank you. SC Just as we are looking at it through the
 scanning telescope, it would be about a, oh, maybe a third of an Earth radii high and to
 the left. CAPCOM Roger. SC But we did, we did identify the El Paso
 and it appeared to us to be a break in the clouds there and we looked in that break and
 saw nothing. CAPCOM Roger, thank you much, out. SC Houston, Apollo 11, over. CAPCOM Roger, go ahead, over. SC Were you following that on the DSKY? CAPCOM Roger, standby. CAPCOM Eleven, Houston. What's your exact
 question, over. SC I've followed the procedure through step
 7 down to the point where I've got 27 303 enter and then we go to an operator light. CAPCOM Roger, stand by. CAPCOM Apollo ll, Houston, stand by a moment.
 We'll have an answer for you momentarily, over. SC Okay appreciate it, Charlie. Now the light's
 gone out without any further DSKY action. CAPCOM Roger.
 SC Correction, stand by that's not right. CAPCOM Roger. CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston. SC Houston, Apollo 11. CAPCOM Roger we've finally gotten concurrence
 on the problem here with 50 guys looking at it. When we were sitting in the 58 team we
 attempted to load the erasable before you terminated the verb 49. So Mike what we're
 going to have to do is call off the present CDU's, copy those down and do a verb 49. Load
 the present, do a proceed then an enter and then we can then set up attitude hold with
 step 6, over. SC Okay, I think that's what we did last time. CAPCOM It appeared to us that we attempted
 to load the erasable prior to entering on the verb 49 which verb 49 was still running
 and it clobbered the CDU's, over. SC Okay. SC Houston, Apollo 11, and we're moving at
 the proper rate. CAPCOM Alleluia! CAPCOM Eleven, Houston. It looks great to
 us now. Over. SC It looks fine here Charlie. The (garbled)
 part is the only part I don't find explained yet. CAPCOM Roger, Mike. We're working on that
 one right now. We're coming up with the story soon, over. SC Thank you. CAPCOM Eleven, Houston, we're having corn
 from Goldstone to Honeysuckle, over. SC Okay. SC Hello Houston, through Honeysuckle or-
 - CAPCOM Apollo 11, Houston go ahead over. SC You sound good to us through Honeysuckle.
 How do we sound? CAPCOM Roger, 5 by Mike. We'd like to OMNI
 configuration as follows. OMNI ALPHA place in BRAVO, OMNI to OMNI - - SC - and the configuration as follows: OMNI
 ALPHA placed in BRAVO, OMNI to OMNI, high gain track to MANUAL, high gain yaw 270, pitch
 -- PAO This is Apollo Control. At the present
 time we are handing over from the tracking site at Goldstone, California, to the site
 at Honeysuckle which accounts for the noise in the transmission -- SC - I've got S-band OMNI Z OMNI, track to
 MANUAL and beam Y and pitch, better say that again, yaw 2 70 , over. CAPCOM Roger, Buzz. I broke up that pitch
 minus 50 at beam Y, over. SC Roger, copy. SC Houston, Apollo 11. Are you ready to copy
 some numbers on status report, etc. CAPCOM Say again, over. SC Roger, ready to copy some numbers on the
 status report, Houston. CAPCOM Rog. Go ahead, over. SC Okay, radiation CDR 11005, CMP 10006, LMP
 09007. Medication negative, and I got some (garble). CAPCOM Go ahead, over. SC Battery C 37.1, pyro battery A and G both
 37.1. RCS ALPHA 82, BRAVO 84, COCCO 85, DELTA 87, over. CAPCOM Roger, we copy. Radiation 11005 10006
 09007. No medication. 37.1 37.1 37.1 82 84 85 87, over. SC That's affirmative. And you want a LM GM
 DELTA V at 1.1. CAPCOM Roger, copy, 11. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. Please verify
 that 4 cryo heaters AUTO, the four fans OFF. SC Okay, we have been holding the 02 heater
 in  the OFF position. I believe that 
 was your last instructions. All the other
 heaters are to ON and all fans are OFF. Over. CAPCOM Roger, standby. CAPCOM 11, Houston. We would like all heaters
 AUTO, over. SC All four on AUTO, all four fans OFF. CAPCOM Hello, Apollo 11, Houston. As the sun
 sinks slowly in the west, the white team bids you good night. If we get 
 a story on  the 7/10ths we can give it to  you  in about 15 minutes or so, if not, we'll give
 it to you  in the morning, over. SC Okay, sounds fine, thank you, Charlie,
 very much. SC Have a nice day today, Charlie. CAPCOM Thank you. SC Good night ail. PAO This is Apollo Control at 36 hours 11
 minutes. At  the present time Apollo 11 is 134 000 nautical
 miles from Earth. The velocity is 4216 feet per second. During that last series of transmissions
 from the crew, we received a status report from Buzz Aldrin and he reported that  the crew has in the past 24 hours taken no
 medication. This is similar to the crew status report we received from them last night. We
 bid them good night at 36 hours 9 minutes or about 2 minutes ago. We anticipate that
 the crew will probably have a few more housekeeping type chores aboard the spacecraft before they
 actually turn in and also we'll probably be combining their eat period with the first
 part of that sleep period. At 36 hours 12 minutes into the flight of Apollo 11, this is Mission Control Houston. 12"

Denial comes in all flavors. Some think the moon landing was staged, some think Tupac is alive, and others reject vaccines. If the United States learnt anything in the 2016 election, it's that social bubbles need to be broken down — so how do you reason with someone who ignores evidence or bends it to fit their worldview? This has been on Bill Nye's mind more and more since climate change denial has become a political issue rather than a scientific one. People can't change their minds instantly when their beliefs are ingrained, so it's not a matter of convincing them on the spot. Nye suggests working together towards scientific understanding by tactfully pointing out that perhaps this person is rejecting evidence because the alternative makes them uncomfortable. Understanding is a process, not a flip switch. Bill Nye's most recent book is Unstoppable: Harnessing Science to Change the World.

Transcript: 

Daniel: Hi Bill. My name is Daniel from Texas. My question is how do you reach someone who is maybe a conspiracy theorist or someone who is anti-vaccines, someone who is staunchly scientifically illiterate and agree with them on what a good source of facts is? Thank you.

Bill Nye: So Daniel. How do I recommend reasoning with a conspiracy theorist. Right now, the last couple of months I’ve been messing around with this idea of cognitive dissonance. This is to say you have a world view; You’re presented with evidence that conflicts with the world view; So you either have to change your world view, which is hard because you’ve lived your whole life with it, or you just dismiss the evidence and dismiss the authorities that may have provided the evidence. The authority could be a person or it could be a book. Or, excuse me, an article on the electric-internet-computer-machine.

So you dismiss the evidence, so that you don’t have this discomfort or conflict in your mind—this dissonance. That’s what I’m working with right now, and apparently the way to overcome that is to say, “We’re all in this together, let’s learn about this together.”
Present the conspiracy theorist with the idea that he or she may be rejecting evidence because it’s just so uncomfortable. And you’re in it together. We’re in it together. I’m uncomfortable too. But when it comes to moon landings, just ask the person how you would generate all that paperwork! The warehouses full of documentation that NASA created to make landings on the moon would overwhelm anybody trying to do it on the side. It would just be very difficult to print all that. 

And just understand it’s a process. Somebody who has a world view that’s inconsistent with evidence—and I may have some—it takes a while for you to turn around. Like the example of palm reading it’s not something that people reverse their ideas on immediately. It takes, in my experience it takes about two years for somebody to sort of look at palm reading, look at cold-reading or a tarot card reading for a while and then realize that these tarot card readers/palm readers are just taking information that you’ve given them, the client has given them, and feeding it back to you. 

It takes a long time and in the same way people who are anti-vaccine I think have just lost sight of the history. Vaccines—you know, part of the reason I’m able to be here talking with you is my grandparents did not die in 1918 during the Spanish flu when it is estimated 50 million people died—Twice as many people as were killed in combat in World War I died of this disease.

If you go to old cemeteries you can see these tombstones of very young people who died of the flu. So people just lost sight of history, and we all tend to go, “Well look at the facts. Change your mind!” But it takes people a couple of years to change their mind. So my recommendation, Daniel, is: stick with it! You’ll get frustrated, the person will get frustrated, but present the idea of cognitive dissonance. This is my latest idea about a way to work together to a scientific understanding.","Bill Nye on Conspiracy Theorists: NASA's Moon Landing, Vaccines, Astrology, and Tarot Cards",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFLtTK13G2w,-1,129462,2259,463,1098,MFLtTK13G2w,"Hi Bill.

#PROPS #MiamiDolphins #StephCurry","""You all know the moon landing was fake."" | PROPS Episode 14",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXhs1WBY1WQ,1,4478,15,24,29,pXhs1WBY1WQ,and I need a hard copy is basically what I'm saying you like hard dog is hard I like it soft copy gathered in between little little tougher like that moray eels hello Andrew Santino hi Sarah Tiana how are you I'm good it just smells really bad in here it does is it Gotthard are you stinking up the hey Judi oh no I shower today so did I did you look and you got a haircut you would say good a little Justin Bieber hair today look at that oh well you know I want to win so last week the bet was you had to eat your least favorite food live on the show and we've got a delicious canned collard green for you yeah that we hand-picked so I have to get just right now I think you got to take a big old whopper out of that right now and we've got a puke bucket down there for you that's nice no balls good one why is this can hot because we heated it up you heat it up we collard green yes yeah come on what's worse second that's come on give me some there we go that's good enough all the way in oh man I almost might throw up watching you mm-hmm no don't hold your nose don't you just swallow it like a grown up I feel like I was on an episode of Survivor Wow do me a favor will you throw that thing in the camp because it smells so disgusting yeah points I get two points for that you guys give her a give her a couple even I said give her some points because that was so gross but you know what Christmas spirit no Scrooge over there or the bet okay well let's go for all right so the bet next week is whoever loses has to go get their picture made with a mall Santa that's right and bring a hard copy a hard copy baby with mall Santa hard copies I wanted pinching the cheek okay on the feel like a good little boy I want Santa okay all right good the first drops the Patriots lost to the Dolphins on Sunday in heartbreaking fashion which I loved with Kenyan Drake running in the final leg of a 69 yard lateral play as time expired for the 3433 win the Patriots last line of defense on the play for some reason was Gronk who missed the final tackle and exclaimed after the game I did sucky the prop over-under point five plays on defense for Gronk the rest of his career oh come on he's gonna play again he admitted I play sucky but don't be a stupid booger head you know he's gonna get more footballs this season I bet you bazillion dollars this poor got the vocabulary of a little dropout but he did go to University of Arizona so my sympathy is with him listen this is his worst season stat wise since his rookie year on offense by the way Lois yards per game and he only has three TDs so perhaps he should play defense is my proposal and I think he should play inside linebacker he's got the size and the speed Plus making Gronk a safety in the first place was a terrible idea he's too safe he hasn't spent a dime of any of a salary and even if he did crayons and play-doh aren't that pricey so I say switch the kid to D anyway he's not playing that good on him yeah he has the size and the speed but he does not have the back or the health to play on defense he's got 19 like braces on also you have to think that he may be purposely didn't make that tackle because it was gonna be a 69 yard run and he loves that number so much that he probably didn't want to interfere also when we say I'm gonna say under just for the record because I think when we say the rest of his career we're talking about four more games because obviously they have three games left and they're probably gonna play one playoff game and they're not gonna win that because Tom Brady is shite this year listen with his back the way it is I think the only thing that Gronk should be tackling is his illiteracy and I'm not sure why he's out there on defense period because obviously he doesn't have the health for it he's only good at setting pics he's good at spiking balls spiking drinks spiking girls things hey he's only good at setting pics spiking balls still farm stiff drinks and stiffy stiffies in his shorts is what I'm trying to say so I don't think you should risk him being out there on defense period I say under so we both went with illiteracy on this one but you're saying it's not because he went to Arizona and I know I'm saying it is it is parson just whatever so no but I'm also saying might as well make the kid play D you can't play offense this year that's high argument you tell us all right we both had good arguments Sarah you almost blew it at the end they're stumbling over your joke but I'm gonna give it to you because i grok is not healthy enough and he shouldn't be out there anyway it should not be out there hard to argue but you know what who gives it prop number two Aaron Rodgers and the Packers honored the firing of Mike McCarthy with their best game of the season on Sunday beating the Atlanta Sarah Tiana 34 to 21 in terse Epson breaking Tom Brady's record of 358 the prop will or won't Aaron Rodgers throw another int this season he won't okay listen I think that let's think about who they're playing coming up I know they're playing the Bears they're your Covey little cub Bears are gonna pick him off but let's I don't think they're gonna pick him up I think they're gonna cause a fumble so I think he does turn the ball over this year but I don't think it's an interception also I look I think Aaron Rodgers does a lot of things with other teams but interceptions is not one of them and you know he's finally getting to call the place that he really wants to play with McCarthy gone so I think you're seeing him throw it at a you know at a greater speed even better Aaron Rodgers than he normally is so I think Rodgers is great at throwing tantrums to the refs he's great at throwing playoff games in the playoffs but he's not good at throwing interceptions so I say well okay he will a Aron is gonna throw another pick at this week and I can tell you it's coming against the monsters of the Midway listen we're in full effect we lead the league in interceptions at 25 were on fire Chicago Bears bear down the D is so good that Sarah might leave her boyfriend for it also by date we're in his head because his girlfriend Danica Patrick is a Bears fan did you do this although although I watched her on Rich Eisen show and she said she's a Bears fan because she was born in Beloit Wisconsin or something but it's the border and she's kind of in Illinois I gotta tell you yeah border towns I don't really like I think Trump should let us tear gas she's coming into Illinois therefore Rogers is going to blow this and throw away pick Rutgers all right come on the tear gas joke was good was borderline I'm just kidding I think I think you both have good points there Sarah had a good point about that they're gonna cause a fumble not throw pick but I think it could be both I think Rogers are pushing it here at the end so I'm gonna give you 12 first yeah let's go don't ask about points oh yeah creative yeah I mean you're doing a great job man thanks buddy oh my god number three while Aaron Rodgers has zero interceptions in his last 368 passes do you know how many Mark Sanchez s in his last 368 17 including two of 14 passes on Sunday after which he was benched for Josh Johnson who hadn't thrown a pass in the NFL since Gossard was an elementary school in 2011 the prop over/under one more NFL start for Mark Sanchez okay old but fumble is gonna see the kid again you know I know what they say kids you know what they say if at first you don't succeed throw in your fourth string I know he's garbage I know he's terrible but it's the last game of the season against the Eagles okay that's their last game of the season and who better to let let him play against than the loser team that didn't bounce back well from a Super Bowl that benched him for Sam Bradford I don't know if you remember that I think he's still sore from those wounds and both of these scrubs have no chance in the postseason anyway so let them play each other let them play their most garbage teams and why waste time with Josh Johnson this guy this guy who's played for seven different teams he's been dropped more times than Sarah has as a baby so I say they're gonna throw the kid back on for one last hoorah cuz he's done this season that's it okay you lose points because he's played for way more seven accountant he's gotten on and off of 15 different only played for physically seven teams he's been rostered for more than 17 he was in roster nobody's played on the field how about a little fun fact you know 2011 when Josh Johnson made his last start for Tampa Bay Mark Sanchez was the starting quarterback for the Jets Colt McCoy was the starting quarterback for the Browns and Alex Smith of the starting quarterback for the 49ers if misses in his destiny to be the starter it's so meta and I also just love that the the Redskins could possibly win out and I hope they do because I do think he's a good quarterback and I know it will piss Dan Snyder off to have a black quarterback on his team that is doing well I think this also be Exhibit A and passionate defense in his trial against the NFL as to why he is being excluded and if it's not he's an idiot he won't need him to play in order for that defense to go through what I think look at this kids still playing yeah well Josh Johnson and can still start and Josh Johnson's black that wouldn't be any proof it have to be Sanchez oh my god to get old old Long Beach Marky Mark listen I don't think Sanchez sees the light of day I would have taken the bet against Sanchez starting last year and I will take it this year as well Gotthard you got to tell us I'm gonna tell you I think everybody's tired of Sanchez yeah we really have seen quite enough and I think I'm allowed are gonna be moving on and we won't be seeing him anytime soon so tying this bad boy up I think he's got one more guts in him but whatever prop number for 14 weeks down in the NFL and your Super Bowl contenders are starting to bunch up just like my undies as juggernauts like the Rams Chiefs and the Saints have recently looked vulnerable and your usual suspect like the Pats and the Steelers are both coming off big upset losses the prop who is the best bet on the board right now for Super Bowl champ okay I hate that I have to go first on this but I think I'm gonna say Chiefs because they're they have 5 to 1 odds right now I think it's Andy Reid is due to win a playoff game finally I think you know the up I just feel like at this point he would literally have to throw the game to not let them go to the Super Bowl I think you've definitely seen how the Chiefs are missing cream hunt they definitely look much more beatable now that he is not in there but I think you just have to shake the dust off of Spencer ware and get him healthy and then all of a sudden you finally have that team back to where they are also this last week was really not a display of anything that mattered because last week was a complete wash in terms of Rams Chiefs everybody and they're playing especially you know whoever that team was that beat the Rams I think the Rams are obviously not good in cold weather and they've proven that but they don't have to play in cold weather ever again rest him down in spunk Lana or whatever it is listen that team that beat the Rams my Chicago Bears are my best bet listen it's the best money bad because it's plus 1810 great insane if they're gonna make great money if you pick the Chicago Bears look with Mitch being healthy now taking down the Rams was massive for us and it shows that we are a top team in the NF scene the only buddy that we have left to worry about is those cousin kissers down in Louisiana Saints are good okay they are very good but they show their weakness by losing to the Cowboys because the Cowboys are amazing on defense they might have the best defense in the leak not just the NFC I got to tell you we are the powerhouse that is going to take over the NFC and I do think Drew Brees is gonna collapse against somebody like the Bears we've got the best defense we we get more defensive than Gotthard does when I kiss him on this show what's all this we Sh we nothin down down all right I think you make some good points there especially about Chicago's defense I didn't think that Chicago would even have a chance at the Super Bowl this year come on so it's it's hard not to go with the money there I'm gonna give it to you Santa yeah baby yeah of course it's great money hey listen you know my boy came home yesterday and the very first thing he said to me is I got to put a bet on the Bears good the odds are so good it is like you know I would put a bet on the monday night football commentators not coming back I think that's probably the best odds got to be like five zillion to one prop number five in a football we're a quarter of the way through the NBA season and we've got a bunch of exciting things to talk about including the return of swaggy P the veteran guard and the shenanigans that come with him remained unsigned until this Monday the Denver Nuggets decided to roll the dice and sign the ex-boyfriend of Iggy Azalea the prop over/under one playoff game as a nugget for Nick Young oh come on the only way swaggy sees any more time as if they keep getting plagued with injuries first of all I can't even believe he's still playing Nick is my boy I love him I think he's great but get real Paul Millsap and Jamal Murray just need to smoke some of that Denver Nuggets nugs get healthy again and Nick not-so-young has been an accent player for pretty much the last latter half of his career and this is not in an accent this is clear English he ain't playing and they ain't going to the playoffs which is most important okay they're not going there's no way even after OKC and Golden State get the best of the West Denver still has to answer answer to a surprising clipper team and the Grizzlies so don't count them out just as Mike Conley's having some troubles I love the dude but with a healthy roster there isn't room to play a guy who just dropped seven a game because they already have Mason Bienstock Plumlee clogging up that category so I don't even think he plays I don't think they make it to the playoffs anyway first of all he only has to play in two game won't do it so even if they go if well why wouldn't they they're number three in the West right now that's not the question of where we are in the season and the question is does he play one playoff game and stay healthy I think he plays two maybe three but that's you know that's to me a safe bet I think he's embarrassed that he wasn't playing at the beginning of this season I think he's embarrassed that he got cut by Golden State I think he plays his ass off because I think it's like a very rude awakening for this swag Meister or whatever he calls himself Lee I know that he gets hurt a lot and that he but I think he's more booty hurt than anything and I think because of that he helps the Nuggets and they're about to get as daya Thomas back so I think it's gonna be I think they're our true contenders in the West yeah they're not but they are not they're not even the Lakers even the Lakers and the Clippers have good records in the West but who cares but who cares because they're both playing fine everyone's playing fine Denver's playing fine the question was that who's gonna win the vs. if they're gonna go to the playoffs and I don't think they will I just don't think they will I don't think they have enough manpower especially I would like to keep that in recording so that we can play that yeah I think that'd be a good keep on yeah do it because do it I disagree with you I think the Nuggets are gonna make it and I think in a good good argument you're playing too so ever give her a couple there I like to see because he knows it's not even halfway through the season all right prabha six just when the Kyrie Irving flat earth stories had started to die down we get another NBA superstar player casually promoting his belief in a major conspiracy theory while on the ringer podcast winging it earlier this week Steph Curry declared he did not think that we had landed on the moon saying the whole thing may have been staged by director Stanley Kubrick the prop which conspiracy theory is actually true a flat earth or a faked moon landing the Flat Earth Earth curtain by the way it's pronounced earth star and it's flat and I think first of all I don't think either of these things happen I think the only reason we have a picture of the earth is because we landed on the moon and I completely disagree that that's a real picture in Shaquille O'Neal's words I've driven from LA to New York and I it looked flat the whole time listen I believe in gravity because I know that my boobs used to be a lot higher up on my body so I'm not disagreeing with the idea that gravity is it real but I think all of this like round earth is just a conspiracy by the globe lobby to sell more Globes at Christmas whoa blobby the earth is flat on eight sides I think it's shaped like a cube I think it's flat on eight sides and in my opinion earth earth be real well I'm not surprised that someone from the South think the earth is flat let me tell you something about this whole moon lamp the cheese in space first of all there's no wind in space so why did the flag move alright there's no stars in any of the pictures because astrologist could have identified it and proved it wrong and also the shadows are as inconsistent as Sarah's contouring and the footprints they were reserved perfectly okay they're preserved without moisture and that's very hard to do to preserve things without moisture just ask Sarah's boyfriend you guys the moon landing was faked Neil and Buzz and all the cats know it they said the flag got knocked over cuz of rocket propulsion baloney Pony puddin pie they did prop they did prop setups on a stage in Hollywood they looked identical to the pictures that supposedly were in space don't give me that baloney he had just been real all the crap that you read on reddit that I'm on the internet researching for this job oh yeah okay you know I think you get that minus point you know the moon landing was faked you know the earth is I don't know one of us can say you don't know this is I think the real winner of the argument is whoever wins this game so if the Raptors beat the Warriors then we'll find out who who who's real okay whatever whoever plays that game that's a winner the winner winner that game actually wins yeah well there's got to be some kind of driving force behind a conspiracy theory and I never thought about the globe Lobby thank you so I think that's a winning argument right there they're keeping it in business the earth is flat I had so many factual proof yeah but I didn't know about the globe I came up with my own as opposed to Gendo about the no moisture and the footprints being preserved just not as oh because of the footprints in the sand it's the same on the moon Jesus take off number seven back on earth Santino we have real and important stories we have to cover in Ireland this week a woman who had married the ghost of an 18th century pirate says the two have split getting divorced after less than a year together the woman a Jack Sparrow impersonator named Amanda large claimed that even those sex with the spirit was as fulfilling as sex for the physical human their romance needed to come to an end the prop will or won't this Irish woman and her three hundred year old ghost pirate ex-husband get back together I believe in love this swashbuckler can't resist the one-legged king of the sea even if he was a horn swag ler avast ye she'd be dancing the hempen if she thinks she can move on with the pirate's duffel I'll translate that later to yeah listen if she leaves him it's only gonna be worse when she dies cousin job to see his ass every day in the afterlife and in the hell that is a Wells Fargo line that I believe exists and wherever we end up she's been married before and you know once twice three times a psychopath so she said sex was so good it was better than human sex so she might miss this ghost and I didn't know ghosts had sex until now but now that I know what the moaning is in haunted houses they're just ghosts jacking off and I'm smoking all over us so I think she's going back to the old goal I think you can't break oh she is not going back to em because guess what there are plenty of dead fish in the sea okay you know you know that why she broke up with him because he didn't text her back he totally ghosted her which is bull and way too meta and how come all the like you know he broke up with her she I don't know regardless he made her feel invisible even though he was the ghost so I think acted also after they got married they got they bought a house together and he didn't even pull his weight so I was nothing yeah well he couldn't pay his part of the bargain and a pirate without any loot that's both called booty so it's a bad sign apparently this woman is also a psychic on the side as a pope also an impersonator psycho well anyway she I can't believe she didn't see the divorce coming but when it's a ghost you probably don't see anything coming outstanding guys joke writing and we're real good when it's not just focus on sports pretty legit it's hard to it's hard to pick a winner out of that you both had really good arguments I'm gonna probably go to Santino because I think she is preparing for the afterlife trying to make things better yep that there's no way when you would go back to a ghost thank you here Trump over here it's rigged and when she went it's not rigged okay whatever okay Gotthard card prop so we can really settle this yeah all right well not all of my buddies are completely famous and this one is a rising star Clinton you want to take it away bud hello guys my name is Clinton and I'm the parking attendant at Yahoo Sports my property you guys this week is who's better at parking Sarah or Andrew oh come on first of all that parking attendant is dope and that guy is actually haha Clinton dicks I thought that she was gonna be really effing fun yeah I parked next to you today and I could tell you Andrew backed in and I did not have enough room to open my door because he parked it terribly yeah over the line like that so people can't park next to me yet you squeeze it in I squeezed and

moonlanding,Explore the truth behind the iconic Buzz Aldrin moon landing photo. See how modern graphics innovations can shed new light on a 45-year-old conspiracy theory. More info: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2014/09/18/debunked/,Debunking Lunar Landing Conspiracies with Maxwell and VXGI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9y_AVYMEUs,-1,1481412,6441,925,3663,O9y_AVYMEUs,July 16 1969 Apollo 11 blasted off from the Kennedy Space Center carrying three astronauts on its perilous journey to the moon five days later as the world watch with bated breath astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first men to walk on the moon but not everyone is convinced that this historic journey actually happened over the past 40 years numerous theories have called into question the photographic evidence that has captivated the world the fact that the landing was actually done in a television studio and it was the big black background like you know fake stars up as the flag being planted on the moon facing one way and the shadow the man being the other way he never heard that maybe the terrain that was seen on the video wasn't accurate walking wasn't accurate there are no stars in some of the photographs and that there should be because there was no atmosphere and that the stars would shine so brightly those photographs can be demonstrative not to have been taken on the lunar surface if they were not taken on the lunar surface there's any one other place they could have been taken now that's on earth on the surface some of these claims seem reasonable but do the scientific facts lend credence to these conspiracy theorists so with our new technology in Maxwell we have the ability to do something that's never been done before which is global illumination in real-time what that means is I can actually simulate the bouncing of light off of multiple surfaces and lighting other objects with that technology we look for what's the opportunity to show this off and there's this very famous photograph of Buzz Aldrin as he was descending the ladder of the lunar module when they landed on the moon we're modeling basically a real-time version of the Apollo 11 landing site in Unreal Engine 4 there's been a lot of speculation over the years about the lighting of that and whether you know that the experiencia theories of weather is real so we thought it'd be cool to try to simulate the lighting of the landing site for an accurate point of view we want to take on the challenge of showing no the single light source of the Sun was actually able to light Buzz Aldrin even though he's in the shadows the task was a huge undertaking and no detail was too small to overlook it's actually really difficult to get a physically accurate version the moon because as it a lot of different properties than than the earth the environment of the moon and the surfaces on the moon have their own peculiarities for example the moon has no atmosphere so when you see the Sun in the sky you won't see a blue sky around it because there's no air in order to scatter that illumination into the blue colors that you normally see to make sure that this is actually accurate we did a lot of research on the different properties of the lunar soil spacesuit material the material on the lander looked at a lot of photos the lunar landing area satellite imagery of that we had to model the landing site an astronaut that was realistic to the Apollo 11 space suits model a land that Matt materials and the different colored regions on it and the shape of the lander legs and ladder and all the kind of thing that's all plays into how the image is created after the painstaking process of getting every detail modeled in 3d the team then had to create a physically accurate lunar lighting model we have a bunch of different modes that you can adjust in the demo sort of those crashing through the technology and the first mode is basically showing and how it would be if there was no indirect light or no bounce light at all so basically no global illumination and that mode kind of simulates what it would look like just by default in most game engines and that's the source over a lot of the conspiracy theories come from because when you look at that scene Buzz Aldrin is completely in shadow because he's on the shadowed side of the lamp the way that we normally think about light is that it comes from a light source it hits a surface and then it reflects toward a camera but actually lights more complicated than that because it doesn't just bounce straight to a camera it also bounces and hits other parts of the scene these inter reflections make up a lot of the illumination content the next step is basically adding additional point lights to simulate light bounced off surfaces and that's just TAS replaced by human so if we enable that we can see that it doesn't look very realistic at all the next mode uses Maxwell's new rendering operations to render a more accurate view that actually does take into kind of speculation bounce light off the ground but even after the light was modeled using Nvidia's voxel based global illumination the image still did not look right part of the challenge was we've got to get the surface reflection of the moon dust we got to get the reflection off of the lunar module we got all of that in place and properly modeled we thought but the image still didn't look quite right there was some additional light source that was just missing turns out we found a clip of videotape that was shot from the other side of the ladder as he's coming down the ladder from the opposite side there is a huge glowing bright white light and as we analyze that video a little more we realized it's Neil Armstrong himself the bright white space suit that he was wearing reflected all that sunlight off of him and back onto Buzz Aldrin so essentially Neil Armstrong himself was a light source in that scene it makes sense when you look at you know the albedo value which is amount of is reflected into your eye basically from the surface for the lunar soil is around like 12% but the suits because they're like a Teflon coated material they're around 80 to 90 percent and so they're very reflective it's almost like a mirror except you can't see something in the reflection it just reflects the light once we pulled that information in and actually modeled a second astronaut and the light coming off of him the bounce light was correct and Buzz Aldrin looked lit properly as it did in that very famous photo taken in 1969 another apparent anomaly in the photographic record is the lack of stars in the black sky and some say they know why this obvious omission was made Khurana MERS could have easily discerned that the star positions were not those that would have appeared in a photograph taken from the moon so it's another case where they could not fake it so they simply ignored it the thing to remember is that when they're on the moon the the Sun's up there in the sky and it's effectively daytime for them now if you took a camera and set it up in your own backyard and set the camera settings so that it could get a good picture of everything that's in your backyard and then kept those same settings waited until the middle of the night and tried to take a picture of the stars you'd find out that you couldn't see anything when you looked up at the sky could you actually see the stars in the solar corona in spite of the glare we were never able to see stars from the lunar surface or on the daylight side of the moon by eye without looking through the optics there actually is a star field in the sky and we have an adjustable exposure on our camera so if we crank up that exposure to see the stars you can see the bright light of the moon surface starts to glow and glow and get blown out and they take over the entire scene global illumination techniques have been used by CG artists for over a decade but has only recently become possible to have this physically-based lighting in real time graphics for the longest time global illumination been used in film and offline rendering to get the nice subtle look of lighting bouncing off of multiple surfaces unfortunately she has been too hard to do in real time now with Maxwell however we have enough horsepower to do global illumination in real time so we can get that same kind of subtle lighting effect in games and all these real-time applications because of the power of Maxwell Maxwell makes this possible because in order to do the global ination we have to produce a voxel eyes version the scene and Maxwell is actually very efficient at doing multi plane of renderings required to do this it also can push a whole lot of polygons because you know computing different levels detail above the block slides data requires mobilepass over the scene and so being able to botanically access memory much more efficiently that allows you to compute this thing much faster than was feasible for when you compare the photo with the final rendering actually strikingly similar so I think lends credence to the fact that it's not a conspiracy so the lunar landing demo is a very nice recreation not just of the 3d geometry of everything that was in the scene at this landing site but a lot of attention to detail as to how the materials would have reflected illumination and where the light was coming from and simulating that light hitting these materials and that combination of attention to detail is why this thing can be regarded as a pretty good pass of what it would have really looked like up there on the moon it's tough to prove a negative right can I prove that they didn't shoot this thing on some Hollywood sound stage nope I can't prove that but what I can prove is that the lighting environment on the moon can indeed be modeled and run in real time on Maxwell such that we can see that with that single light source of the Sun and the bouncing of the light off the surface of the moon we can see Buzz Aldrin while he's in shadow so now in 2014 yes I could go around and in real time I could make a game of walking around on the moon and it would look as real as as it did at any of the photos that you saw from the moon land I could do that in 2014 technology in 1969 technology no way we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard
moonlanding,"Photographing the moon is harder than you think. So hard, in fact, that two early astronomical photographers resorted to building an incredibly realistic plaster model of the moon and photographing *it*. Their mock-up garnered enormous acclaim and sparked dreams of flying to the moon.",Fake Moon Better than Real,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QopQhx8uneg,-1,16933,46,19,21,QopQhx8uneg,the moon had been something that photographers had tried to photograph um right from the beginning when the gare even tried um and it didn't work partly because the plates are pretty insensitive to light the moon is quite faint really and then of course the earth rotates which means if you have a long exposure you're going to get a blur and you can actually see that in the gear type in the middle but in 1851 the guy who was the son of the director of the harvard college observatory in a boston portrait daguerreotype is because most aguero types were portraits paired up and they figured out how to to do it um and they had to rotate the telescope you know ever so slightly yeah so that it would follow the rotation of the earth um on these pictures and they made them just you know there were as incredible then as they are today in the end photography didn't do more than drawing a good drawing could but because they were photographs they had it was real yeah it was real and this album like nate smith and carpenter i mean this was hailed as the triumph of astronomical photography by astronomers um but what's amazing is that the photographs are plaster models and the astronomers know that i mean there are plaster models based on drawings made through the telescope and astronomers were perfectly aware of what they were looking at but they felt that because they were photographed that they added this sort of layer of authenticity to the undertaking that simple drawings didn't have down two and a half forward forward at 40 feet down two and a half picking up some dust thirty feet two and a half down straight shadow four forward four forward drifting to the right level and a half 30 seconds contact light okay engine stop aca had a defense oh control both auto defend engine command override off and then i'm off or 13 is in tranquility we copy on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue we're breathing again thanks a lot you
moonlanding,,Neil deGrasse Tyson On Controversy Over Apollo 11 Movie 'First Man' | The View,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZAMoQTTnSg,-1,403762,4413,443,1400,fZAMoQTTnSg,neil degrasse tyson is our favorite astrophysicist in the entire galaxy no any others yeah his wife is also an astrophysicist but he's your favorite and one of our absolute favorite guests his new book The X is accessory to war please welcome back somewhere I am so proud to know Neil deGrasse Tyson just I must ask about this because about 10 years ago you and I had a little dust-up I was really upset that Pluto had been downgraded by him it was him but he was the front of it it was a lot of scientists yeah I drove the getaway car actually he drove the getaway car he was in the face of you know downgrade so I gave our time and now a new study says it should never have been downgraded so it's a planet in this race briefly I think we need more words than just planet to describe what orbits a star ok given the diversity in the variance we have rocky planets big ones small ones gaseous now some are in the habitable zone where you can have life some are far some of this some have tails I think we need 50 words rather than just one okay and so I'm not even in that fight Bluto just be a planet like all the others you know our Moon has 5 times the mass of Pluto do you know Pluto in it's morbid crosses the orbit of Neptune don't they name a dog there's a dog drawn the same year that Pluto the cosmic object was discovered to have the same tenure in the hearts and minds of America Americans are the biggest complainers about the demotion of Pluto I think it's cause of that damn dog okay another topic the Trump administration recently announced plans to create these spaces which apparently would become the sixth branch of the military would you act would that be helpful do you think well just I'm gonna make it clear because just because that suggestion came out of trumps mouth doesn't mean it's a bad suggestion okay just because of that no no I'm just has to be clear if you want to analyze all information in its own context but spaceforce come on but did you complain when the airforce separated from the US Army I wasn't alive the US Army Air Force in people's civil command and control in air is different from command control on the ground and the soldiers have to be different that's on how to fly the engineers have to be different that's a no aerodynamics so they peeled it off and nobody said why are we doing that no it was a very natural progression in the change of the theatres of operations I'm just not a I don't object to it and if you're gonna do it throw in asteroid defense while you're at it because that could render us all extinct how about clean up all that space debris that could interfere with Commerce there's so much space assets now we're huge they should bring you in no no we are walking around on the surface of the earth got our GPS got out of this and all the stuff is coming now from space got my direct tv and and Bluebird is an entire industry that exists only because of GPS satellites as well as tinder you want to know who to mate in 24 hours GPS the people who invent the gps knew that that's how that was going to be used so it's not as crazy as it sounds it's just a name I think these features they gave we're very muscle-flexing given American Mercure we're gonna America and so but really space has been quote militarized since the 60s in the sense that we've had reconnaissance satellites we're not not plot laser guns or anything but just it has been in the service of military interests okay ever since we have the ability we're worried about a war in space between US and some other countries shall be nameless you should worry more about war on the ground worried about that too right this leads into your book because your new book is called accessory to war and it talks about how astrophysics and the military have actually been entered wine for centuries since millennia millennia you go far enough back you know Captain Cook when he went to the South Pacific his marching orders were oh there's a there's an interesting astronomical phenomenon going on in the south you can only see it from the South Pacific here go measure that so he measured what's called a transit of Venus Venus passes between us and the Sun and if you measure that you learn things about the rest of the solar system he did that oh by the way flip over the page Oh while you're there here's some extra navigation tools developed by our astronomers map every coastline you find and bring that back to us within two decades Great Britain took control of Australia of New Zealand of Tasmania a Fiji Island of all those countries there have the Union Jack as an insert in their flag this was knowledge of the universe brought to bear in navigation for in the interest of empire build this we have been handmaidens to this activity from the beginning I was I was I was uncomfortable about this here so long and then I realized not all conflict is bad you're not gonna go in the Second World War and say you know Hitler's rising no I don't want to I don't like war that was the last good well that's what I'm saying so I stopped judging war just outright saying all war is bad because the history of war is one where very important causes were fought against very bad people and so so in this book it's an exploration of how science broadly but my field in particular has served the interest of nations wow there's so much I think that we can be proud of as a country when it comes to space and it reminds me next year marks the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11th historic mission to the moon you mentioned the moon early there's a new movie coming out with Ryan Gosling called first man of a movie about Neil Armstrong the movie starring Rango there's been some controversy about this because that iconic image of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin putting that American flag because if any this was a very patriotic moment for this country putting that American flag in the moon that people are frustrated why wouldn't they highlight that in this movie it's not even in the movie well well right oh it's about him yeah right so a B do we all not know that Americans did this does he not have the American flag on his on is out is the American flag not on the lander is does it not say NASA there's no secret about who went to the moon and slingers Canadian that could throw them all by the way what were the words on the plaque what would he say one small step for man one giant leap for mankind he just say what small step for man one giant leap for the United States so there is a unifying concept in the messaging that was put on the moon look it up if we come in peace for all mankind yeah those have become a piece for America so ritualistic but but it's history also but we know that that's the pity you already know it what it is what is it accomplishing I don't care one way or another really I just know makes us feel better about ourselves and you say I need the flag to feel better I think that the flag should have been included but let's talk about something okay sure you're one of the nicest guys we know oh one of the smartest but you played against type on the Big Bang Theory season premiere fritz right oh okay remember I'm the guy who kicked Pluto out of the solar system and it deserved it so thank you bye-bye whoa that was fun let's see who else needs a deGrasse kicking Bill Nye science guy hey Bill Neil Tyson we've got to talk call me a capital a so producers writers directors I got it and they want to put science and they're saying oh yeah I got a cup well you know before we go I just want to say happy birthday can I say it your turn let's do this way how fun is that so we got you a little something something to celebrate Oh No and all of you are getting the book you

make sure that his face movie looks like real space we can make a film that shows us going to move without actually doing it you guys shot a movie called Operation avalanche yes we didn't it takes place in the past yes established thing that look for you guys I mean I know there's like a lot of insane like visual effects trickery but there's also the 16-millimeter ingredient like how did you approach it we shot it on red but we designed our red kind of feel like an old Eclair NPR which they shot a lot of news and documentary on that then and lenses were actually well they're from an old news cameras camera but they were the same lenses that they would have put on those eclairs whoa I don't think any of us realized how brutal making a period piece would be you and by that I mean you couldn't just have an idea for a scene go shoot it you had to really bring a lot of things together to then go in and just spontaneously have an improvised scene that you just talked about that right right a nice camera the car stops get the intersection yeah he's got his gun right on Zapruder flies out of that alley it gets in the car it gets into the car with the super Goes Down virus Joe Toye Josh wait yeah this my car yeah Roger lon you're coming up here fast now it's two of them am i going back pedal to the metal yeah but josh is sketchy stop he's got he stopped you and you get out because he's gone you get back in the car and you're like you I'm going out of what yeah house on me I just his left before the party ah I pretty dance privately so like that car chase scene for instance you know it was written to like Matt's driving down city streets and bumping into cars and you know we soon realized like that was far beyond our we weren't going to be able to do that so it was like oh where can we do it and so I go we could do it in like Dundas Ontario on some conservation area in the middle of a field but why would that ever be in a field oh maybe he's hiding something what's he hiding yeah then this idea of like oh he's hiding the film that we see him making Wow stumble and all like there why don't you okay I get him man then it became a plot point that really helped us and it was totally out of necessity of making a period movie unlimited resources don't even that we haven't done is Owen giving me a gun oh yeah so that's a scene that that has to happen to wanted the scene the second basement scene you should give you should go into like a little block box we just don't do anything the right way like nothing we do an hour and a half long takes that will go between 18 scenes and the only rate you'll know that is because every single person working on it Jarrod Andy me Owen Jay Miller no the whole movie in our heads so you haven't written the scene yet no moving on and the movie changes every day because we all talked about it but we're not writing down how it's changing and if we are it's in the most clipped like these your business yeah no like a little email between seven people writes like instead of this now this is happening and then all of a sudden we're all calibrating so good yeah it's a bit maddening but it's like it's fun because even throughout the process there's always like something that you're doing that's good that keeps your hopes up but often it'll be completely gone action career documentary but like archival footage what's that with that it was like kind of a process where we knew what we had we'll work from archival footage and then we did everything we could to make that into the movie today on operation avalanche we're doing some VFX work VFX artist Tristan zurafa we're just very creating the camera move and it was dictated by the archival footage and eventually we'll have this camera re-enacted in a real world physical space and then eventually when they're overlaid action should look like Matt's walking through the archival footage the whole program is incredible yes like that's you know that was the most fun singled and the movie was getting to just dig into the history of the Apollo program two very expensive rentals no ultimately I hope that NASA sees it the way we do yeah but this is a bit of a love letter exactly Apollo program as much as it was it's a bit of a hoodwink but it's not one that's damaging couture you guys are obviously all like you graduate about the story so now that you've gone through the process of faking the moon landing do you think it could have been done no in fact in fact I'm I was I was at zero faith that the moon landing was faked before we started and I have you been less yeah yeah we tried for Regina desperately to fake the moon landing is not possible so well thank you for finally clearing that up yeah see I know you were ID in the world yeah I'm disappointed but I understand but you know what that disappointment is an important reason why we made avalanche and that's because the story of faking it is ten times better than the story of hard-working scientists doing their job yeah year after year yeah and finally achieving what they said exactly they would do this looks ridiculous there's one on the moon perfect perfect okay stop junk you

The moon landing proved one of the pivotal moments of the 20th century, and in modern human history. Neil Armstrong's 'one small step' was seen all around the world, and remains an iconic piece of footage for scientists, astronauts and star-gazers alike. However, conspiracy theorists forever insist that the achievement was a fake. So, how would the world be different if it was?

Unveiled,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_BnfpOiMDs,-1,38906,363,69,378,U_BnfpOiMDs,what if America faked the moon landing on July 20th 1969 Apollo 11 touched down on the moon a little past 4 p.m. Eastern Standard Time Neil Armstrong and Edwin Buzz Aldrin with Michael Collins overseeing from orbit looked out over the lunar landscape and reported back to NASA the American people and the entire world exactly what they saw a TV audience of millions watched the historic moment unfold but what if none of it actually happened what if instead of landing on the moon the United States government actually did faked the whole thing how would history have played out differently before diving headfirst into that alternative timeline and surrounding ourselves with conspiracy theories is the official Apollo 11 story for 2 hours and 31 minutes the NASA astronauts toured the moon after landing at the Sea of Tranquility eventually Armstrong became the first man to ever walk on the moon speaking the immortal lines one small step for man one giant leap for mankind as such Apollo 11 is still seen as arguably the ultimate expression of American success technological achievements and its then superiority over the Soviet Union but we should also remember that the mission would never have happened had not the Russians beaten America into space in general on October 4th 1957 the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 this 184 pounds satellite launched from a Soviet base in modern-day Kazakhstan dazzled and frightened US citizens in equal measure the fact that the Soviets their Cold War foes were the first to make it into space galvanize the US government to undertake a massive funding campaign for their own exploration endeavors school officials and proud parents worried that Soviet children were becoming intellectually superior to American kids especially in science and math which led to massive education funding indeed the National Defense Education Act of 1958 was one of the first major school funding programs specifically designed to make American students more internationally competitive in science math and technology and so the space race had started as an extension of the Cold War it was fought in the classroom first then in the engineering labs and ultimately in the great beyond Apollo 11 success is often seen as the final battle of the space race with the triumphant Americans finally erasing any embarrassment that Sputnik one may have caused them but partly because of the geopolitical implications of 1969 s moon landing many conspiracy theorists have long suspected that the whole thing was engineered to generate some indisputable pro-american PR popular theories often points a supposed evidence obtained from the pictures and videos of the moon landing itself some suggest the image of a fluttering American flag is impossible because there would have been no breeze the counter-argument says that the astronauts inserted a strong wire to the flanks fabric to make erecting it easier and that caused the ripple other hoax claims questioned the shadow on the moon but this effect was reportedly caused by the artificial lights of the space module itself and then there's the since debunked apparent impossibility of leaving footprints on a waterless surface today Russia seems is specially determined to keep the moon landing rumor mill turning perhaps understandably one Russian theorist the activist Yuri Milken has actually spent years trying to prove that all of America's lunar missions were in fact forgeries McCain also says that he's an expert on nuclear science but there's no verifiable evidence for that claim either however a cynical space race spectator could argue that there were logical reasons for the United States faking the landing by 1969 America's war in Vietnam had become increasingly unpopular at home and abroad growing discontent over the conflict plus America's struggled to actually defeat the North Vietnamese Army eventually led to decades of tentative foreign policy known collectively as the Vietnam syndrome so space race success provided an effective and appropriate distraction from the problems elsewhere closer to home some organizations in the civil rights movement including those advocating for more welfare for single mothers and minorities actively protested against the Apollo 11 mission with some demonstrators showing up in Florida on the day of the launch for them it was a waste for Washington to put so much money into space travel when they should be helping the poor thanks to the eventual success of the mission lots of Americans have forgotten how divided their country was at that time but if Apollo 11 had failed qualms about government spending would have felt even more justifiable and anger over the ongoing Vietnam War could have reached even greater heights we're still if the moon landing had been uncovered as a fake the government would have suffered a seismic loss of integrity and public trust would have plummeted to all new lows there would have been no definitive moment in history to swell national pride but rather a monumental blunder belaying a sense of shame embarrassment and outrage so in a reality where the famous director Stanley Kubrick really did have a hand in faking the footage as per a particularly while pedal theory then because of the impact it would have had it would have stood as probably the greatest and most emotionally effective film he had ever made and he made some good ins but even with Neil Armstrong's one small step by the early 70s left-wing opponents were denouncing America and American capitalism as neo-fascists so throw in a blatant attempt to con the entire world by lying about their lunar accomplishments and international faith in the US government could have disappeared completely to America's place at the top table of global politics might never have developed as it has done today while Soviet power and influence might have far-out rip their rivals on the other side of the Atlantic it's easily forgotten now but after the communist victory in Vietnam many American pundits argued that Washington had bestland to accommodate Marxist Leninist as Vietnam China Laos the USSR Cuba Cambodia and the entire Warsaw Pact were all communist states left wing and center-left parties were on the rise in the West too so an exposed moon landing hoax right about then could have men increasing supports for communist ideas or at least anything that was anti-american more and more voters might have come to the same conclusion that journalist Lincoln Steffens did all the way back in 1919 he famously said about Soviet Communism I have seen the future and it works of course it could be said that Apollo 11 where the fake or real had little bearing on the ultimate fall of the Soviet Union after all the USSR continued on until the early 1990s and only collapsed because of a costly war in Afghanistan rampant corruption and in ongoing inability to keep up with American military spending a popular summary might read that American administrations outfoxed the Soviets in the 70s and 80s and thanks to a succession of short-lived leaders Moscow seemed to steadily weaken for many the decline of the USSR was only a matter of time but the moon landing could still be listed as an early catalyst gaining America a lead that never relinquished however our hypothetical proven hoax might have triggered an early shift significant enough to change the course of the Cold War and the shaping of European and global politics regardless of its diplomatic influence though a moon landing hoax would have truly angered the American people not only would it have provided the Soviets and everyone else with enough anti-us propaganda material for decades but it would have sensationally shattered the already stretched relationship between the White House and the people and the far flung fakery would have etched a permanent stain onto American history

Strangelove was one of Nixon's favorite films in the end Kubrick agreed the fake footage would be shot in England in the MGM studios near Boreham wood with a skeleton crew the two technicians and two actors would be CIA agent now whether you believe in the conspiracy or not there are some interesting parts of the shining that I believe to be messages from Kubrick himself about his involvement for instance take a look at that shot of the kid playing with the fire trucks around what I believe to be a tiny NASA launch pad also look at his sweater which says Apollo 11 interesting now the boy Danny he gets up and goes down the hallway to room 237 but in the book it's rude to 1-7 what's the significance of 237 you ask well the moon is two hundred and thirty seven thousand miles from Earth you see I believe that Danny represents the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and him going into room 237 is the same as Kubrick going into the studio to film the Moon Man but Stanley Kubrick was a perfectionist faced with the CIA crew's lack of professionalism he ended up against his better judgment supervising the shooting of the fake moonwalk but he told them from Monday morning you're out of my life for good now when the kid comes out of the room is Apollo 11 sweaters torn and he has marks on his throat and he can't speak a metaphor for Kubrick being silenced about his involvement in the whole thing there's also little hints sprinkled into the storeroom there's a box that reads box 39 and what was the launch pad number for the Apollo 11 mission what wasn't let me think 39 also there's tang in there no not that kind of Tang you pigs get your mind out of the gutter lay off the red tube Tang was the drink that the astronauts use to drink on space flights a nice cool glass of Tang tang is for earth now just don't want to be earthbound and go the energy breakfast drink worth would Richard Milhous Nixon lie to us would America lie to its people just to beat the Soviet Union in a race to the moon meal in the dark on the luck Commission is it go minutes everything was so much easier in the 1960s they were fantastic politicians were honest cigarettes were good for you who needs a filter only pansies were seatbelts martinis at lunch mmm a drinking and driving no big deal grabbing girls keisters by the water cooler they loved it in 1984 it was just a book not a how-to manual for the NSA what that's not American what do some sort of commie bastard some poo Khomeini conspiracy theorists oh this thing's will kill you what do you guys think did the Apollo 11 really go to the moon was Kubrick even involved or maybe was he just a back-up plan in case things went wrong let me know what you think in the comments below in code hey this topic tickles your pickle you should check in a movie called Capricorn one it's about a faked Mars landing that came out just eight years after the moon landing it's pretty good flick and OJ Simpson's in it I have discovered a litany of conspiracies in GTA 5 that need to be examined I'm talking a Bigfoot superhuman ghosts

#NASA #moon #ConspiracyTheory",Moon landing conspiracy DEBUNKED (again) | What The Future,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpHYJ4IgN4w,-1,113148,971,1118,1885,OpHYJ4IgN4w,this one's for all the conspiracy theories out there nvidia has proved that the moon landing was real by generating a fake one welcome to what the future on today's show proof that the moon landing happened if all the other proof wasn't good enough for you a ridiculous fire truck concept that might be crazy enough to work and lastly Russia releases dramatic video from a failed manned rocket launch but first let's get lunar and video was looking for a way to show off Maxwell its new graphics processing unit so it decided to take on one of the most famous bits of evidence that the moon landing was faked conspiracy theorists have said that the lighting in this photo taken by Neil Armstrong was impossible since the Sun was the only source of light and Buzz Aldrin was in the shadow that sounds like it could be true until you account for the reflected light the Nvidia team made an exact replica of the moon landing using Unreal Engine 4 with that model Maxwell was able to calculate the light bounce using what's called voxel based global illumination or VX GI the xgi is basically a huge leap forward in processing how light bounces off surfaces in 3d renderings the nvidia team discovered that Aldrin had been lit by the sun's reflection off the moon's surface as well as by the sun's reflection off of Armstrong spacesuit another famous bit of evidence beloved by moon doubters is the lack of stars in the sky NVIDIA has an answer for that too it's basically the same reason we can't see stars during the day on earth the Sun makes everything else too bright if you wanted a picture of the stars in the sky on the daylight side of the Moon this is what you would get pretty ugly can you imagine the kinds of comments the astronauts would have got if they brought back pictures like that this fire truck concept seems like the brainchild of a 12-year old Tony Stark on a sugar high and I can't stop watching it when there's a fire in town you sure as heck don't want your fire trucks to get stuck in traffic but the twisted minds over it too here in chat have a solution the same engineering company that brought you flying trains and the drive-through supermarket wants to revolutionize how we fight fires this concept firetruck can sail over traffic and when it arrives at the scene firefighters ride a massive drone to the upper floors to meet the fire the drone is armed with cannons not sure what the firefighters are loading into them but I'm guessing it's some sort of flame retardant once the fire has been doused it's time to rescue the bystanders ladders have their limitations maybe drones really are the answer the idea of fighting fires with drones isn't new latvian company our own ace tested a firefighting drone last year and it was able to reach heights significantly greater than those reachable by firefighter ladders makes this concept firetruck look a little less ridiculous doesn't Russia is preparing for its next crewed rocket launch even though the last one didn't go so well on October 11th a Russian Soyuz rocket failed mid-flight in an attempt to bring NASA astronaut Nick Hague and Russian cosmonaut Alexei of Chinon to the International Space Station the failure occurred when one of the strap-on booster blocks failed to separate properly smacking into the central core rocket stage of the Soyuz resulting in decompression of the cores fuel tank the rocket lost altitude control and the escape system was triggered automatically the escape procedure has been described as being launched sideways out of a shotgun the two would-be space explorers landed in Kazakhstan on relatively flat terrain and were immediately sent for medical evaluation thankfully both men were fine and Nick Hague has said he's ready to fly again Russian investigators have since determined the failure was due to a deformed sensor that was damaged during assembly since the mission failure on October 11th three Soyuz Rockets have been successfully launched and the date of the next crewed launch has actually been moved up from December 20th to December 3rd we'll be watching best wishes to offer a safe and successful mission astronauts bravely risk their lives pushing their bodies and minds to extremes in an attempt to expand the limits of human knowledge a little bit farther with each mission instead of doing a viewer question this week I'd like to take a minute to respond to the letter a' of comments that we get doubting the accomplishments of NASA and its scientists my late grandfather was a solar physicist and a veteran who dedicated his life to the discovery of objective truth most people who pursue science as a career are interested in discovering objective truths because that's what science is in its most basic form if you doubt a scientific truth that's great skepticism is a huge part of science but skepticism alone doesn't make truth and it certainly doesn't make science the scientific method has been the basis of scientific advancement percent here's how it works you have an idea the moon landing is fake you turn that idea into a question how did they fake it you formulate a hypothesis I think this is how they faked it you make predictions this is what I expect will happen when I test my hypothesis now it's time to conduct your experiments to minimize errors make sure you have some sort of control group for the thing that you're testing and make sure that another scientist could conduct the same experiment and achieve the same results this is something called peer review which is hugely important in the scientific community lastly analysis what do the results mean do they support your hypothesis or not if this sounds like a lot of work of course it is discovery of objective truth isn't easy if it were easy we'd all be scientists that's all I have to say on the matter bring on the hate the love and the harebrained hypotheses in the comments thanks so much for watching what the future I'm your host Jessie URL we'll see you next time
moonlanding,"Writer/director S G Collins of Postwar Media debunks every theory that the Apollo Moon landings could have been faked in a studio. The filmmaker takes a look at the video technology of the late 1960's, showing alleged fraud was simply not possible. -- Apollo 11 Moon Landing Site Seen in Unprecedented Detail: https://www.space.com/14874-apollo-11-landing-site-moon-photo.html",Moon Landings Faked? Filmmaker Says Not!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_loUDS4c3Cs,-1,706253,18260,3277,26003,_loUDS4c3Cs,"this is why the moon hoax would have been impossible take one did people go to the moon in 1969 I'm not totally sure I wasn't on the moon then did they faked going to the moon no I'm pretty sure they didn't because they couldn't some people say that in 1969 people were incapable of sending a man to the moon but that they were capable of staging the whole thing in a TV studio in fact the opposite is true by the late 1960s they did have the technical ability not to mention the requisite madness to send three guys to the moon and back they did not have the technology to fake it on video now please understand I'm not saying this to defend the honor of the United States the US government lies all the time about all kinds of things and if they haven't lied to you today maybe they haven't had coffee yet so it's easy to believe the Apollo program is a lie too especially if you weren't alive then and if you don't know much about the technology profiles of the day you see the later you were born the more all powerful movie magic seems nowadays it would be very easy to fake the moon landing and we seem to have forgotten how to do it for real back then it was the other way around really ever since the 1920s engineers were trying to improve liquid-fueled rockets and their guidance systems they wanted to go to outer space the people who were paying for it wanted better bombs by 1943 very firm brows people already had a fully functional suborbital rocket called the aggregate fear later known as the v2 after the war the German rocket scientists went to work for to rival superpowers who then went to insane lengths to outdo each other on the world stage it was a global Dick Ragan contest on a scale never before seen in human history it's fair to say that technology growth in the Cold War was mostly a competition in aerospace rocketry and weapons science that was the kind of engineering people strove to excel in and by the mid-60s limited space travel was a possibility I think meanwhile film technology had gotten wider and television was still busy trying to be in color now here's where the stories diverged in one version the Americans waste 20 billion dollars to send three guys to the moon plant the plaque that says we came in peace for all mankind and then go home to bomb Cambodia in the more tantalizing version NASA at some point realizes they just can't so to avoid humiliation they hire Stanley Kubrick to produce and directing landing telecasts you know he did such a great job of 2001 years later once the Apollo astronauts are starting to collect Medicare some people get a lot of attention by pointing out flaws in the photographic evidence from Apollo when you listen to them they seem not to know very much about photography or video or lighting or even perspective and I think they're hoping you don't either so we should have seen stars in the sky no we shouldn't the camera was set to expose for broad daylight if they were exposing for stars then this picture would have looked more like this hmm flags waving in the breeze no it isn't it's wiggling in the vacuum after they let it go and the shadows diverge unrealistically across the landscape no they don't go outside sometime and see how shadows work they obviously use multiple light sources in this picture right no they obviously didn't I've been shooting in the studio for about 30 years now I know what to look for when you shine two lights at something you get two shadows so this would have looked more like this but it doesn't because this stuff was shot with a single light source and if that light was anywhere near the action you would have seen a fall-off in brightness across the terrain you don't because the light source was 150 million kilometers away too far away for the inverse-square law to make a difference get it etc etc blah blah blah the thing is all these discussions are ignoring one simple point in 1969 it was not yet possible technically to fake what we saw on TV why are people missing this I think maybe they forget how primitive video was in 1969 I mean it was an amazing achievement in electronics but there was a lot they couldn't do let me try to explain that the pivotal claim for the Apollo hoax theory without which it all falls apart is that what we saw on TV was slow-motion footage of astronauts running around in a film studio because if it was a slow motion it couldn't have happened on earth right let's talk about how slow motion works in film and video there are two ways to make motion slow one is you shoot it at normal speed and play it back slow the other is you shoot it fast and play it back normal the second way is called overcranking it looks smoother and more realistic because you're sampling natural motion at a higher frame rate but that means we would have had to shoot it on film using high-speed film cameras right why because in 1969 there were no high-speed video cameras yet the electronics just weren't there some people did have a magnetic disc recorder that could capture normal speed video and play it back slow they used it for sports replace it could record up to 30 seconds playback at 10 FPS and you've got a whopping 90 seconds of slow-mo I'm sticking with 10 frames per second because that was the video frame rate for Apollo 11 they had a non-interlaced slow scan TV camera specially made for them by westinghouse all the later missions were using regular NTSC cameras running at 2997 fps that would be three times harder to fake I'm trying to make this easy keep in mind that when people today watch documentaries about the Apollo missions they're looking at the highlights they're looking at you know short clips cut together the short clips are much easier to fake but in July 1969 600 million people including me we're all staring at a continuous lunar telecast that went on for a long time it's actually pretty boring sometimes at 16 minutes into the EBA they turn on the video camera four minutes later you get your one small step fan then Aldrin climbs out and they move the camera onto a tripod and proceeded to do all their moonwalking flag planting photo snapping and rock picking then Armstrong climbs back up into the lander and it's over by which time the video camera has been running for 43 minutes so if we're faking this with electronic slow-mo at 1/3 speed we only need to record about 47 minutes of continuous live-action video well that's a lot more than that Ampex disk recorder could hold but NASA is special maybe they have a big disk recorder right in 1969 okay how much bigger 95 times bigger I don't know man I mean government agencies are powerful but they're not God then again they are NASA maybe they did have some special way to over cranked video in 1969 for an hour and a half maybe they have some top-secret high-speed electronics that the rest of the world never knew about oh wait a minute no you guys said that the navigation computers were too slow I guess we can't have it both ways I mean it can't be fast and slow at the same time right wouldn't it be easier to shoot this on film I mean in 1969 we already knew how to over cranked film for Apollo 11 we only need to shoot 30 fps and play it back at 10 okay let's try that I'd recommend you shoot on thirty five-millimeter to minimize the shown brain that's what Kubrick would have done now let's see normal 35 millimeter runs at 90 feet per minute but since we're shooting at 30fps there will be 112 and a half feet per minute we need 47 minutes of original film so that's about 5,300 feet and of course there's no such thing as a film magazine that big Volkswagen but if you shoot thousand foot loads that's about that big then you can do it in five mags I mean I can do this you don't want to see the splice marks where you put the reels together because then everybody would know it was a fake and remember we're shooting for TV so it's one three three aspect ratio and not one eighty five so that means you have to do a and B rolls you have to split cut the negative into a and B rolls and print them onto a fifty three hundred foot fine grained inter positive then cut an answer print in the film lab and when you're done make sure everybody that works in the film lab dies mysteriously in a car crash now now you just need to find a custom-designed tella city that can transfer your fifty three hundred foot answer print to video or ten frames per second pin registered of course how hard can that be of course you need to be absolutely certain that in all that splicing and printing and transferring none of the most common film artifacts have gotten onto your giant print no bass scratches no emulsion flakes no gate we've no brain and not one single fleck of dust because any one of those things will instantly betray that this is a hoax okay so you do that and then you do it again for five more lunar emissions only those later missions you have to play back a 30fps meaning you have to shoot it like 60fps twice the torque twice as many splices to keep clean twice as much of a chance that the film's going to break in the camera you think maybe it would be easier to just go to the moon I don't really know if that's possible like I said it wasn't on the moon in 1969 and neither were you I can tell you that in 1969 it was not possible technically to fake what we saw on TV sorry Kubrick a no Kubrick and why does any of this matter well my concern is with the ultimate fate of knowing of seeing the difference between what you can know and what you wish for because that's what puts the sapiens and Homo sapiens without that you're just another homo the urge to believe drives people to trade in part of their soul in exchange for the comfort of being a rebel ok but that step from knowing that you've been lied to to believing that everything else is a lie is a big step once you're forced to hypothesize whole new technologies to keep your conspiracy possible then you've stepped over into the realm of magic it demands a deep and abiding faith in things you can never know it's like you need to cling to your belief system with all your might against the overwhelming evidence of your own rational mind and some people do what's dangerous about that is that it blinds you to the real conspiracies that authorities are perpetrating on you right now as we speak things that are a lot more important than whether some guys went to the moon if I I mean I'm not America but if I were I would much rather have you be questioning Apollo 11 and not questioning the Patriot Act the Iraq war the financial industry bailouts and the right to indefinite military detention without charge those things are real thank you for watching excellent my check came from NASA you"
moonlanding,"Radiation is one of those words that frightens many people.  In this video, Fermilab’s Dr. Don Lincoln explains the known kinds of nuclear radiation and their different properties.",Types of Nuclear Radiation,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTb_KRG6LXo,0,213681,6438,72,506,iTb_KRG6LXo,"Radiation can be a scary word for a lot of
 people. But just what is radiation exactly? I mean, you probably know that it’s responsible
 for such 1950s monster movies like Godzilla, but that doesn’t tell us much. Radiation in the sense that we normally mean
 the word was discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel when he discovered that uranium could fog
 a piece of film. But even that definition of radiation is incomplete. So what is radiation, exactly? Radiation is the emission of energy by a substance. There are lots of kinds of radiation. There is electromagnetic radiation and nuclear
 radiation. Electromagnetic radiation encompasses such
 things as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet light, x-rays and
 gamma rays. These are all pretty familiar and aren’t
 what we normally mean when we talk about radiation. I mean, microwaves can cook things and ultraviolet
 light can give you a sunburn, so it’s not like electromagnetic radiation can’t be
 dangerous, but it’s generally not what people mean when they talk about radiation. Actually, gamma radiation is an example of
 that kind of radiation, but we’ll return to that in a bit. When people talk about radiation, they mostly
 mean nuclear radiation, which is when subatomic particles are emitted from the nucleus of
 atoms. I should also say that nuclear radiation is
 sometimes called ionizing radiation, as it’s energetic enough to knock electrons off atoms. But I’ll call it nuclear radiation to remind
 you of the radiation’s origin. And there isn’t just one kind of nuclear
 radiation. There are at least four different kinds. There is alpha radiation, beta radiation,
 gamma radiation and neutron radiation. Each of these types of radiation have different
 characteristics. Alpha radiation is when an atomic nucleus
 shoots out an alpha particle, which consists of two protons and two neutrons. If you dust off your chemical knowledge, you’ll
 recall that the nucleus of a helium atom contains two protons and neutrons, so alpha radiation
 is when a radioactive element shoots out a helium atom, minus the electrons. Beta radiation is caused when an atomic nucleus
 shoots out an electron. We could call it electron radiation, but the
 name was invented before we identified the emitted particle as an electron. It generally occurs when a neutron in an atomic
 nucleus turns into a proton and electron. The proton is kept inside the nucleus and
 the electron escapes. Gamma radiation is when an extremely high
 energy photon escapes the nucleus. In a sense, this isn’t different much different
 than a nucleus emitting ordinary light, but the much higher energy involved means that
 the gamma ray can damage surrounding material. Gamma rays are often used in comic books to
 give super powers to unsuspecting spectators. By the way, x-rays are similar to gamma radiation
 in many ways, but less energetic. They are like gamma radiation’s younger
 and less successful sibling. And then there is neutron radiation, which
 is just the emission of a neutron. In a sense, this is the most dangerous type
 of radiation but, as we will see, that’s a subjective statement. So, these are the different kinds of radiation
 that one encounters in nuclear physics. But, as we will see, they have radically different
 properties. This isn’t a radiation safety video, but
 it’s important to know at least broadly what you need to do to be safe around radiation. Perhaps obviously, the easiest thing to do
 is to just get far away from radiation. Just like a fire seems cooler, the further
 you get from it, distance is the easiest way to reduce your exposure to radiation. However, that’s not always possible. We live in a radioactive world. Bananas are radioactive, as are Brazil nuts. Heck, you are radioactive. I made another video discussing levels of
 radioactivity and, if you watched that, you’ll understand that low levels of radioactivity
 are not inherently dangerous. But there are things you might encounter that
 are more dangerous- things like dental x-rays for example. Now don’t worry about dental x-rays- they
 give you a very low dose and are definitely worth having, but if you’re for example,
 a dental hygienist, you might encounter lots of x-rays and want to protect yourself. So it’s important to know about the ways
 in which you can shield yourself from various kinds of radiation. Alpha radiation consists of heavy and slowly
 moving particles with a lot of electrical charge. These properties combine to make them easy
 to stop. You can stop alpha particles using a single
 sheet of paper. Here- I’ll show you. Here is a sample that emits alpha particles
 and a Geiger counter. The paper stops the radiation. Beta radiation consists of light and fast
 moving particles with electric charge. This means that they can be stopped by reasonably
 thin plates of material. For instance, we see here that they can be
 stopped by a thin metal plate. Gamma radiation consists of fast moving particles
 with no electric charge. This means they emit no electric fields to
 interact with matter. They are therefore much harder to stop. To stop gamma rays, you need a heftier chunk
 of dense material like lead. This is also true for x-rays, which is why
 they put a lead apron on you when you’re getting dental x-rays. Neutron radiation consists of pretty heavy
 particles with no electric charge. Since they don’t interact with atomic electrons,
 they can travel long distances- say hundreds or even thousands of meters in air. The way to slow them down is not so intuitive. You have to use something with a lot of hydrogen
 in it, like water or plastic. The neutrons hit the protons in the hydrogen
 nuclei and knock them out. This stops the neutrons and then the charged
 protons are stopped quickly much like alpha particles are. By the way, given the clicking noises you
 heard, you might be wondering if the technician doing the demos here was in any danger. The answer is no. The radioactive sources we used were real,
 but they were weak. This diagram shows you roughly how to shield
 the various kinds of radiation. It summarizes what I’ve just said. So I’ve told you about how to protect yourself
 from radiation- distance and shielding. And, for shielding, I’ve told you what works
 for what kinds of radiation. But what if you can’t move away or get shielding? What impact to these types of radiation have
 on human tissues? This is kind of interesting. It turns out that the different types of radiation
 have distinctly different consequences in terms of biological damage. In order to figure this out, scientists took
 different kinds of radiation and aimed them at various kinds of tissue and saw how much
 biological damage occurred. They then came up with a number that would
 account for the differing amounts of damage observed. This number is called a quality factor, or
 just Q. If Q is one, that means there is no adjustment. If Q is greater than one, that means that
 this particular kind of radiation is biologically more dangerous than other types of radiation. So, we see here a chart that shows the Q factor
 for different kinds of radiation. We see that gamma and beta radiation and x-rays
 have a Q factor of 1, which means that they don’t have an enhanced damage capability. But slow neutrons have a Q of 5, which means
 that for the same amount of absorbed radiation, more biological damage occurs. Fast neutrons have a Q of 10 and alpha particles
 have a Q of 20, which means that they do more biological damage than other kinds of radiation. That last one is kind of weird. I mean, alpha particles are easy to stop,
 but do more damage in living tissues. But, if you think about it, this makes sense. When an alpha particle stops, it stops hard,
 and deposits all of its energy in one place. This means when it hits a cell, the local
 damage is extensive. This is especially true if you are unlucky
 enough to inhale alpha emitting radioactive dust. That’s extremely dangerous. So I hope that this video this kind of gives
 you an idea of the diversity of possible kinds of radiation. I mean, there isn’t a single kind and that
 means that if you want to understand radiation and how to react in a certain situation, you
 really do need to become informed. However, that does take work because, in the
 end, understanding radiation is like your Facebook status when you’re deciding if
 you want to get back together with your ex. It’s complicated."

TOXIC LUNAR MOON in My WORLD!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umkRJuv3c7k,0,161628,3764,122,701,umkRJuv3c7k,oh man loose loose fat mr. prayer for Minecraft guys I gotta tell you something all right this is super top secret stuff minecraft guys you know how Gucci minecraft this you got hair prize you got the lunar we got the Steve's got a bunch of crazy things but let me tell you something okay Masami I found a brand new secret and it's called the toxic load Arun so the previous videos way way back on a sharp when I discovered the lunar moon in my craft we went online and we actually defeated the lunar moon so here's a little clip Oh No okay who's you gonna realize very shortly that the lunar route is gonna be flipped upside down hot it's gonna be even more down oh so on today's video I found the exact minecraft seed that you need to some of the toxic Luna moon your minecraft you don't know what the little moon is I already showed you guys a little clip of that but pretty much the toxic Luna moon is a corrupted version of the lunar moon that's green it has different types of abilities like for example toxic water and so on now let's head on over to the single-player minecraft world let's create a brand new minecraft phone and call it the toxic lunar moon all right now let's turn up hey you gotta listen up okay I know you but I'm also not but I don't care if you're playing alright so now go to the seat generator and type in toxic just like that so t0x I see lunar but this time with a four and an R then m00n and three three three at the end okay so click on done that's the exact see you guys maybe you guys type into your microphone yeah you gotta type in the Y controlled with this exact C for this to work okay click on done create a brand new microphone any of a small percent chance of your world having the toxic little moon and the way to tell is the grass is gonna be different color and the water is gonna be green check it out so the entire water is completely green and this is this is pretty sketchy man I'm sucking around right now so I don't know what we're gonna do but we got to find the world bro we got to find land cuz the nighttime the lunar moon's gonna spot so we get prepared by getting some materials of our learned stuff so we could take on the lunar moon and hopefully survive the first night so mu so where the plane is we got to go ahead and build over there so that small little eye and grab as much would possible so we could make a boat ain't get off the sound cuz we're currently on a on a pretty bad time unfortunately so let's go to grab some plots and let's get over there so boost tell me I'm not exactly sure why the water is green buses like a toxic little moon I'm pretty sure and this thing is gorgeous and you don't want to talk to no poisonous stuff oh my gosh it's a long way to go come on man all right here we go bad and we have touched okay so do not follow the water it's poisonous let's grab this let's grab these log blocks and let's quickly make a boat so we can get to in mine and start mining away and we night it's like a real land because I don't want to be on an island you do not want to fight the lunar bird or eyelid dude like blows things up and stuff you don't know what the little moon could do man you gotta be very very careful okay like last time I put a shark he was like summoning like crazy like on I don't know it was like obsidian like weird things that was like what up into the world I don't know it was it was very strange oh here's a little clip though a peek oh no this place is blocking something as I help ya look at this power I broke the blocks a lot of fireballs what is going on oh okay okay so we're ready to go we got a bunch of one and let's get to land ASAP it's a couple so get you out like a time Survival Series right all right here we go to make this real quick okay and this and that and we are ready to go and let's make a boats here we go perfect all right I am ready to go mister pretty I'm so sorry about how I wish I could break it with you but this is all just a jet for boost mission I'm out of here bye mr. pig a booster ah we have found the land okay so ready to go now right off the bat we gotta grab some cobblestone and hop inside of the cave so let's go ahead make a wooden pickaxe real quick here we go one of pickaxe alright grab some cobblestone and let's start getting some iron ASAP so we get prepared oh it's perfect like that we are armored right there Aaron thank you very much amazing my friend amazing whoa no we got no time to waste as soon as it becomes nighttime things get super dangerous and I don't want to die today I'm do not feel like dying today moose are me all right here we go oh yeah hurry up hurry up booze come on man oh cool yo it's just perfect look at this there we go and couple more iron we got a whole entire stack and if we can find some diamonds that also be really great now I'm also wondering then again like if the lunar moon spawns outside cuz it's like the moon actually now technically it's worse out of a cave are we gonna be fine huh it's actually very interesting oh let's save like if the lunar murky light break through the ground stuff I don't know but I think we're we technically fine because when we go to see us and stuff so like how he's gonna tack it's like break through the entire like world I wanna make any sense right so let's grab some cobblestone and let's make a furnace okay we have everything we need we are ready to go and we're just back crammed forever right here we go yeah there we go so let's our smelting some materials and we should be good now I need some I need like a way more iron look what can we finally exposed iron is anything here no oh there we go awesome the biggest thing you can do is to definitely write up a  about some torches okay here we go a little bit more iron I'll get the job done and let's do this okay so boots army we should be good I hear zombies um I'm guessing the zombies should be down here here over here wait what here oh look look even more perfect oh Jesus this Oh skeleton you'll be under your shield ASAP she's a key to fighting the lunar moon oh look it's the water check it out okay so we got some more iron we are ready to go c'mon c'mon I gotta get as much as possible I could not lose this weight I'm not sure to die come on we're pretty much like professionals right I mean we've done this before so we got to be good there we go get some more iron perfect let's go let's go let's go let's go might it all up y'all I'm so sketchy I am super sketched for this it's like nothing we've encountered before because of the fact that can get poisoned was that do that sound that was so sketchy what's oh my craft sounds are scary man like lots okay so boo sorry we are pretty far down inside of the cases them an option attack me but we found simple iron its tells of art all around here but we almost have enough iron for full alright armor should I just want to die to anything that's like the scariest part ever jewel that was so sketchy I'm soloing help okay come on come on come on we cannot die man we cannot die oh geez Birds obby goodness oh no come on bear you know you you want to do this right okay so bow sovereign we are finally back up it's a body sunset so uh gosh we gotta hurry this up we gotta hurry this up come on come on come on we gotta smelt as much possible right now here we go put one here break it all up break it up break it up come on Oh we did some more time cheese come on hurry spill this melting broke and you know the one and he's much possible here we go we got to hurry this up guys we don't know how much time and I'm not trying to get blown up by this thing dude there we go okay let's go make it some armor ASAP let's over the shield some of the shield here we go yo I am panicking your eyes legit panicking right now that should add I know here we go this is good got the sword got my boots got the shield and everything okay we got blocks and he said torches let this place up and we gotta be careful with mobs I do not want mobs spawn all around be very cautious oh

is not it have no food I have a very low health all I have is a shield and that's about it and Oh No he's a fine boy take a look at this it's floating wait I just remembered it when we fought the lunar movers deflecting the fireballs and that was the Luna moon's weakness I don't know this is gonna be what effective this time but let's try it out all right piggies come on come on all the animals all the animals possible okay okay okay do not follow the water no okay Mousavi I really don't know what we can do here I have you cheese do we need a house of something okay really do a houseboat we need something ASAP Oh have a heart yo this is so bad this is food okay do we have wool yes with school wait good idea got a really good idea just stay away from the lunar moon I said moon shot me we're currently out of the lunar moon site so we can't exactly hit us so all we gotta do now you just quickly make a bed I want to send my spawn points together die there we go please how you make a bed huh name it what what did what kidding me wait as we see more all my gosh minecraft come on with the crabs to go you serious right now we're still the same problem here let's really make some food though I still can have some hunger and stuff but no Lulu numbers are having is it's completely sure this mountain to get to me look at it it matters to be completed sure but it's my to be D time shoes let's get some more loot there we go any more sheep who know the mouth is gay the short oh come on come on come on come on come on there we go there we go we got some got some food okay now we're healing up there we go see that it's like maybe fireballs gets stuck so if you can deflect the fireballs with a bow and arrow then yes we take out the lunar moon okay this is toxic what could be the Luna moves weakness other than let's say fireballs and some of its own that's nothing think about moon shot me everyone comment down below what is the toxic Luna moon's weakness I need you to help me figure this out help me figure this out something take out the lunar moon in the next video but we've survived night one because now is daytime Joe will see all the damages are gonna moved in check it out guys look at this Wow completely wiped out and completely wiped out an entire Mountain that's how strong this thing is look at it just right through it Joe this is not good man this is not good at all yeah we need to make a bed ASAP so we consider a small point and then they make a little secret underground base but I don't of the Loomer can actually break underneath the ground I don't know about that I mean it broke through a mountain so if we were to see us in this line of sight then it can attack us and take us out yo I'm so nervous it's so scared right now is it so sketchy bro all right let's go over here let's see what we got you know getting a horse would also be a pretty good idea but I gotta find a saddle which is not so easy at Minecraft oh we got some bones there we go okay it's pretty cool I'm sorry horse thing sorry buddy I'm so sorry mr. piggy I need food and resources I can't be not prepared for the next night the man for the night - that's gonna be scary sorry guys sorry sorry gotta go alright so moose army here's the plan we survived the lunar moon we did great but we can't get comfortable because we the deltax is aluminium oooh no damage nothing at all so we should go about making maybe like a like a secret little base over here somewhere let's go to like an underground cave and set up a spawn point in there okay all right here that's perfect there we go let's get some torches down there we go you go we don't how much resources at all alright let's go ahead and like dig this out a little bit and we should be good to go so let's grab a torch okay place it here here here and here let's grab some more of this stuff there we go all right so I mean we really need to iron honestly always in have a helmet I guess you do that's what I was thinking so much damage I don't have a helmet on are you serious if we had diamond armors to help a ton though that's for sure okay grab some coal and let's make a small little secret base here alright so boo sorry I got some resources now let's make myself a helmets let's make also a shovel and I need a pickaxe let's make a pickaxe we need some more wood we're gonna stay here well the smaller the secret base we can actually sleep in stuff let's grab an axe there we go we have all the resources that we need except the pickaxe we need a pickaxe iron there we go more iron and pickaxe where to go come on come on come on come on come on come on you me a pickaxe perfect okay so resources we're pretty good on let's go down to keep a little bit oh there we go just keep going down thanks alright yes oh look at this is perfect it's like a small little cubby area um let's grab some of this let's grab this over here and let's light this place up does it go down more oh it does no way I like this he keeps going down right I think so okay so Mousavi this is gonna be a small little secret underground base that the Luna Moon technically can't see if you can't stencils man come on does it have like heat vision or something right well maybe not only no we get the boy he can't sense us so all we got to do is stay underground won't people this he is see our base but if it does see us it'll be able to track where we go and I biggest give you those fireballs to attack us now I don't know how nice it's gonna be but the lunar module gets stronger and stronger in your Minecraft world as a nice go on so pretty much you gotta kill it as soon as possible or it's good to show your microphone completely and you do not want to mess with this thing the fireballs get bigger the attacks get bigger and whatever it could do so let's make a go over here let's make a little thing right here let's go like this little staircase just like that's alright make sure it's all lit up so no zombies spawn okay alright come on there we go so we'll start covering this thing up I don't not want the little moon to attack us so let's cover all this up and maybe make even like a ladder or something to get out of here we'll make a staircase plus an emergency ladder just I guess we need it here we go oh I'm so stressed out right now this is a lot there's a lot going on okay there we go grab this grab that's okay Irish army we've done a pretty good job here done great let's grab some water ASAP okay come on we gotta grab all the wood possible it's might be nighttime already are you serious it's so quick are you ready hurry hurry come on bro Oh what the heck I barely even touched the water you serious that's sensitive okay that's pretty sketched out alright ah okay somebody beam that time let's cover this all up let's cover this all up moose army we don't even have a bed yet guys come on moose make it better hurry up what are you doing oh I should break it through man I think it saw me DeLuna moon saw me for sure okay so moose army the little bit of break through over here we're still very low on food and resources now we're kind of getting pushed more down here in this cave system so I say we uh we're gonna start digging more in but I wanna I want to figure something out I gotta make a bow so I gotta kill a spider I gotta get some arrows and that can be our super little plan okay is there anything else the cave system something like that no don't think really oh my gosh bro this is a mass mass there's a complete mess guys I barely even have any cold the lunar boot is still breaking through guys oh no here we go come on man I gotta cook everything up possible where's that Oh grab my stuff grab my stuff hurry hurry hurry oh no there's no moon super low on health super low on health come on come on come on come on come on hop on the bed can leave the bed there we go there we go there we go okay so that's our spawn point now let's go ahead and eat this perfect all right we have more food now we're doing a little bit better we have more food we need to make some of this okay so let's get rid of stuff that we don't need we got to keep our inventory pretty clean so let's get rid of all this stuff this is all useless we don't need any of this completely completely useless okay I'm thinking oh it's breaking through completely guys I hope I panicking I'm panicking yo I don't how to not act well under stress okay so let's keep a furnace always on us let's keep it crafting table on us as well okay see that subtracting table on us at all times let's keep some torches all right um just like that I'm gonna need some torches just in case we got attacked by mobs keep all the cobblestone on us here we go cobblestone and we'll put this stuff over here just guess we need it so now moose armory the goal is the goal is we got to survive blue moon again another night okay and we gotta also think carefully we need spiders we got to go out there to get oh no no no no oh jeez oh no jeez cool we're getting flooded guys we're getting completely flooded my base is getting flooded oh my gosh okay well I gotta ruin everything we got to build out we gotta build out of here then we need another way out this is not good we need a complete all the way out until we get flooded we can't get flooded because our bed is here we're gonna spawn here so let's think a little thing out here it's like that let's cover this up like that put down a torch okay and let's start building out your lunar Bert's complete throw up base guys so scary oh okay okay okay there we go we're making progress we're dig it out oh yes hole perfect we need torches we need plenty of torches to make the place pretty late but not again a little bit more like destroys everything so I don't think we have much of a much of an option here come on hurry up eat some pork chops man it's not losing hunger so quick most often why are we losing hunger so quick is it goes up like hungrier I'm tired old man I'm hangry I'm hungry and angry this is it guys this is it right here here we go Luna who doesn't see us so we can't attack us it still thinks we're down in that base okay we go regular service let's quickly get some torches all right stay very low-key we cannot let the Luther moon know they were here there's a luna moon at where is it I don't see it whoo where is it oh definitely sees us that's a fact what is that oh no no giggling Stan now yo whatever that is what the heck oh oh it's everywhere oh okay Mousavi its spotting some kind of meteors bill before he was pillars when we fought the lunar boo but now is some kind of toxic like weird thing goodness it's all around wait it's ice as well so when the ice melts it becomes that this toxic water oh geez oh geez okay will you do now what I get trapped in between any of this oh no no no wait wait I need this I need that oh yes spiders spiders come on give me your shrinking ministry I think that as much a responsible City skeletons as well whoop-whoop think fast think fast think fast come on come on come on come on move summer we cannot die here all right hey Jase we got some we got some arrows move a little bit we need to make a bow ASAP so we can hit the lunar moon back come on we get to some damage to the lunar moon there isn't there oh no the littlest places have some more meteors okay okay okay okay so it's kind of a test it's pretty intense huh come on look take this uh I'm covered in poison we're losing else so quickly Oh trapped I'm traveling shopping shops okay who shot me oh no the Y's kill me no no no no no no no what can I get out oh no no dude I thought oh my gosh we died yuck that was insane that was ridiculous like what's that was crazy I only have two string

on me I had everything wait so Luna mu know where my face is now oh no it's gonna start breaking into my base wait this is daytime oh it's going down the lumen is going down we're pretty good here odo is still attacking us all I had to do is simply make a bow so I can hit the little moon at least once yo lunar booze killing Oh take this oh oh no it's so tough to kill oh my gosh these fireballs explode right away like what if we're fighting a guest ow how okay so moosa' me that confirms it you cannot deflect those fireballs with your sword like what and every single night the Luna moon gets stronger so the fireballs get even stronger so that was uh that was something now let's go find those spiders let's calves let's grab ourselves a bow so it could be ready for night number three okay that's when we're gonna start attacking the lunar moon because we gonna have some better stuff oh my gosh look at it a little moon place down all the stuff around okay well that was an absolute disaster seriously disaster man we got wrecked we got completely wrecked guys comment down below how do we stop the toxic lunar moon and let me know have you seen this thing in your Minecraft world have you been able to get to spawn it's crazy man okay we got some arrows I only got four arrows it's not gonna do anything I don't even know how many hits it takes to kill a little moon but we gotta find some spiders of kill the spiders or I'm sick of it oh yeah there we go perfect kill a thing alright this should give us just enough string right yes here we go let's make a bow there we go awesome so now we actually have a boat but we have barely any arrows so we need Flint's or we gotta get some arrows from pretty much skeleton so when he Flint stick and feathers so let's kill chickens

Flint's okay when he gravel where do we get gravel from no geez it's an absolute disaster guys everything is completely destroyed so anyways I'm slugging the materials and I did see a village over there and just looking around the lunar mer completely destroyed look at that everything's completely destroyed and oh crap oh crap oh there we go gravel any better awesome yes is exactly what we needed man there we go awesome more gravel the banner but I thought of village so let's go to the village hopefully the lunar brew does not destroy the village that would be very upsetting though that'd be very very sad it's probably gonna happen obviously cuz we're gonna save the village but I feel bad for those villagers I got a protective guys I gotta protect them but then again it sees that I protect it but they can destroy the village or there goes use the store without any protection you get the point I don't know what to tell you guys do summon zubaba the fittest out here if

What is Minecraft? Minecraft is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on Minecraft is designed and constructed by members of the community. Minecraft is designed for 8 to 18 year old, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore Minecraft — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet ­to ­be ­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, Minecraft members can earn speciality badges as well as Minecraft dollars (“Minecraft”). In turn, they can shop the online catalogue to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.",Minecraft EVIL MOON APPEARS IN OUR HOUSE IN MINECRAFT / DEFEND THE ZOMBIE FAMILY !!

Switch,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCp_4sjx0a0,0,24364,829,22,293,FCp_4sjx0a0,hey what's up everybody Zeon over here from Nintendo life and today we're bringing you this quick bit of news that Harvest Moon Friends of Mineral Town or more friends of Mineral Town from the Game Boy Advance is getting a remake on the Nintendo switch later this fall and it's really crazy because I was just talking with one of our other editors Austin at e3 about how Natsu may or exceed or marvelous or whoever should just really go back and remake one of the original Harvest Moon games even if they would have just spruced up some of the sprites with the popularity of star do I'm surprised it's taking them this long to do something like this so just why not and then here we are a couple weeks later and a remake gets announced I guess I probably should have talked with Austin about mother 3 also and before I forget this news comes to us from the most recent issue of Famitsu magazine we don't really know a ton about this remake so far one thing that we do know is that it is being made by marvelous which is the original developer of some of the original Harvest Moon games one of which being friends in Mineral Town and more friends in mineral town they are also the developers of story of seasons so with that we know that the games at least in good hands marvelous is also stated that the games going to be kind of a mix between friends and mineral town and more friends in mineral town so based on if you choose to be a boy or a girl I imagine that the story and events will that take place around that will happen differently and now unfortunately I can't read Japanese so I really don't know what else is going on in this article here but a few other things that we can derive just from this is that we can see there's a bunch of new character art a few of the different characters have just been completely revamped the main characters seem pretty similar to their original designs but if you on the right there you can see from left to right there's potpourri Karen I'm assuming that's Rick and cliff and I'm going based just entirely on their looks but it's nice to see that they've all been given sort of a new splash of paint considering the original games came out in 2002-2003 matter of 15 20 years ago and then right next to the main characters there's two other characters that are wearing yellow hoodies I don't know if they're going to be customizable characters or someone new for the story or I mean maybe I'm overthinking this and maybe they're just characters that belong in the film itsu universe like of there magazine who I don't know maybe if I read Japanese or had a higher quality scan of this issue or even just subscribe to film it to maybe I have an answer for you but I don't but then also way off in the right corner you can see two silhouettes of two characters as well so I don't know if they're gonna be new like marriage candidates maybe maybe they're new just components to the story it's just another one of those situations what we're just gonna have to wait and find out you can also tell from the screenshots that everything looks really nice and clean everything has been completely redone there's tons of new character models obviously the original game was 2d I know it was heavily based on back to nature and harvest moon 64 but it's nice to see this game get the attention that it really deserves I sunk so many hours into this game and not to ramble about you know my past experiences everyone knows I do that enough but I literally before I had an internet at my house I used to go to the library and print out documents of like character vials like what their favorite items were different ways to develop new crops like different things to find in the mine or like how deep you had to go to find things in the mine I was obsessed with that game and I probably won't have the same time to throw into it these days as I did back then but I'm so stoked for this game and if you played any iterations of this game back in the day you should drop a comment down below and let me know who you married because I married Karen and the internet told me that this was her favorite so everyday I fed her wine and I didn't realized that that was a problem like I said the internet just said it was okay so I was just like Karen's cool yeah I'm also hoping this game gets some real quality of life updates hopefully they'll have learned a thing or two from all the success that stardew valley had and you know I all the work that they put in the story of seasons as well hopefully that's given them some some new inspiration or or new ways of thinking how did how to do things with this game one final thing to bring up is this game's release date so far it's been announced that it's going to be released on October 17th in Japan but no release date has been announced for the West so we're not sure if marvelous is going to publish it themselves or maybe Natsu Mae is going to get their hands back on this Natsumi does still own the rights to the Harvest Moon name in the West but they've sort of cut ties with marvellous and have started publishing their own games in the style of Harvest Moon but they're just not the same that charm just isn't there if it doesn't get published by Nats and mate it'll probably get published by marvelous and they'll probably go with the story of seasons name or maybe they'll go with the Japanese name farms story or maybe they'll even just call it Friends of Mineral Town but anyways those are just my opinions feel free to let us know in the comments down below what you think about this new remake did you ever play any of the top-down harvest moons back in the day like back to nature harvest moon 64 any of the Game Boy ones or even the the super expensive Super Nintendo one let us know and let us know if you're excited about this remake as well and if you enjoyed this video why don't you present a blue feather to that dear old like button subscribe to Nintendo life and ring that notification bell to be notified whenever we release new videos thank you all so much for listening to me talk about Harvest Moon for the past however many minutes I'm zan from Nintendo life and we'll see you next time maybe Karen was just a collector of wines you don't actually know that she was drinking a bottle a day

(PG, Family Friendly + No Swearing!)",NEW MOON EASTER EGG IN ALPHA OMEGA: RAY GUN MARK 4 & 5 FOUND (Zombies DLC 3 Story),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIlUHG0Fsek,0,467796,11578,498,792,SIlUHG0Fsek,muskan everyone my name is mr. Dalek JD and I have a freaking amazing video for you guys here today about black ops for zombies Alpha Omega I'll be showing you guys an easter egg which 99.9% of you have never seen before and it's been right in front of our eyes don't classified that shows the looks of a mark 4 and a mark 5 Raygun that we're probably going to see an Alpha Omega as well as talking about a secret group introduced in zombies back in 2011 and how we might be seeing them again in it the storyline before Aoife wraps up in a big big way those you that have been on the zombies train since waterworn black ops 1 mines are gonna melt and if you haven't your minds are still going to melt let me know your thoughts on this in the comments section if you enjoy the video a second to click the thumbs up would be super appreciated if you don't want to do that that's absolutely fine but I can assure you by the end of this video your minds gonna be blown you have really enjoyed the video what is this new Easter Egg that links Alpha Omega to black ops 1 moon and classified one of the most mysterious things about classified is its pack-a-punch camos you may have noticed that when you pack a punch it's a very weird camo to what we're normally used to that it's like a blueprint of sorts swirling around a gun and you can't really work out what it is these actually hold some of the oldest zombies storyline law that you can find anywhere like I said your minds are going to be blown so in your screen right now you're seeing one of the camos which is a blueprint for the original ray gun mark one in the zombies storyline as one of the oldest facts this prototype of the ray gun was developed by dr. Ludwig Maxis digging deeper into the story line and the black ops 1 terminal you can find a secret document from dr. Vannevar Bush which reveals more details about the Raygun even though max has created the prototype the actual designs for it was seized from the Rising Sun facility in shi no numa document references that the second generation of the Raygun was under development by H Porter to reduce the peripheral damage but this blueprint reveals that H Porter was in fact the guy that invented the ray gun the first time in zombies history you can actually see what dr. Porter looked like in the bottom left we can see the man himself which is something we have never ever seen before which is absolutely fascinating but even more so as cool as that is if you look just to the right there was a stamp on his photo and this blueprint and it's the logo for Call of Duty zombie labs now if you weren't around during the heydays of black ops 1 zombies zombie labs was a set of 2 short video clips showing zombie testing in labs where scientists were trying to find the best ways to kill them and these videos were used as marketing material for the zombies map pack in black ops 1 these videos were absolutely incredible at the time because their live action showing scientists testing on zombies like you would imagine to happen inside of the actual storyline this involved using the wave gun to kill them it had an official logo as well it really got people excited because it gave a look into what a live action Treyarch zombies movie could be and this came out seven eight years ago never since then we've not heard anything about Call of Duty zombie labs ever again so we assumed that this was not Kanaka in the story here we are eight years later and we're seeing the iconic logo in a brand new stamp form on this blueprint meaning that we might actually see call of duty zombie labs as a fully panicle scientific group inside of call of duty zombies an easter egg from moon is tying in to black ops 4 zombies but it doesn't stop there because as you seen from the title ray gun mark 4 and mark 5 will let me clear it up for you a little bit because here we have the mother of all blueprints in classified again as another pack-a-punch camo and this is of the ray gun mark 2 now back in the day if you saw this you wouldn't think too much of it besides oh this is just the ray gun mark 2 but with the obvious now knowledge that the ray gun mark 2 is going to be elemental this gives us a few little teasers towards what we can expect an Alpha Omega so again it says ray gun mark 2 and the development status is currently with H Porter again and if you look on the bottom again you can see the Call of Duty zombie lab stamp which is absolutely phenomenal but what really sets this blueprint apart from the rest is the fact that we have images of a mark 4 and a mark 5 these are both prototype ray guns as you can see written in the text and especially with the mark 5 with an unstable power output but these are both very different looking to the original ray gun mark 2 and we can either expect to see this in Alpha Omega as part of the elemental upgrades or could potentially be brand new ray guns altogether definitely think of the bare minimum this is our first proper look at what the new ray gun is going to look like apart from the blueprint which Treyarch officially revealed recently you can see on the bottom there that ray gun mark 2 has a much different barrel at the end which we can assume could be to house the different elements but this looks like a much beefier version so it looks like an entirely different beast in itself and the two bottom ones that we see as the mark for a mark 5 look a lot more similar to the zombies in space land pistols than they do as an actual ray gun Treyarch have fully put this here on purpose for us to notice and for us to work out the details there's something which 99.9% of all classified players would miss because you'd never be able to see the camo like this but comparing these blue print camos to the official blueprint we've got of the new ray gun they are in the exact same style like as if Treyarch fully intended on their teaser to match these camos or equally exciting is talking about the ray gun mark 4 and mark 5 blueprints we need to jump back to ecology zombie labs because something which we've had around for over eight years that we assumed wasn't part of any Canon now is and we need to look over these trailers to really try and work out what's going on is back in 2011 these were seen as just some fun marketing videos and nothing more but quite clearly there is more to them than meets the eye the whole premise around the college is Amba labs is a group of scientists who are of course trying to experiment on the best ways to kill the undead in the first trailer they heard that they recently discovered a zombie population on the moon which is something which obviously wasn't a thing until Samantha was trapped in the MPD it all went to hell in a handbasket but the methods they use is a zombie in an astronaut suit with the wave gun then we know that when we upgrade the zap guns you wield version it becomes the porter's x2 zap guns your world so safe to assume that portal also developed this weapon that's where they got the hands on it but interesting enough as well there was a lot of talk back in the day because of the bold man within this trailer shooting the wave gun looks very similar to the bold man on the Ascension poster which has been a fiasco for years and years and we got pretty much confirmation from dr. Monty in the ascention remaster that that guy was in fact Gersh who knows if this guy in the trailer is gosh I highly doubt it and don't think they fought that far ahead there's a few other interesting Easter eggs in the first trailer which we can actually link up to classified really well and almost too well in fact that it seems very coincidental bond classified we learned through blueprints that the crueler zombies were genetically mutated using pig DNA and in this trailer we get to see a real-life cruller which is having to be held down by several agents in ecology zombie labs and you could maybe assume that the Nova six crawlers were actually created from the pig DNA mutations in the zombie labs themselves and with everything involving around classified and alpha-omega dealing with the American side of the storyline rather then group 935 Germans everyone we see in this trailer looks to be American which is another very strange link now something to notice as well in these trailers that none of the zombies have any different eye colors to suggest that they're being controlled by someone through the ephah know it sounds like a really minor detail but even in other live-action trailers involving zombies in the blackops universe they have had different eye colors so it's really quite intriguing but in the second trailer there is a really cool easter egg that involves a scientist in a hazmat suit disposing of chunks of zombie into a furnace which is a throwback to der riese in itself but one of the items in there is a teddy bear obviously simulating a zombies reference to Samantha and the teddy bears you get from the box and all the easter-egg teddy bears you'd find to activate the music what is it unusual to see the zombie lab stamp as we do see it on the wave gum blueprint Easter Egg which you can find in one of the black ops 3 multiplayer maps but yeah the wave gun was introduced into the game right around the same time as a zombie labs trailers this is a new era of the storyline where we're seeing new variations of the mark to which we know we're going to see an Alpha Omega but it has the Call of Duty zombie lab stamp on it which is really cool obviously back in the day in 2011 it was Jimmy Solinsky at the reign of zombies and I'm sure this is probably his idea but seeing as this is going to be the last two maps in the ephah story so we're told they want to tie up all the loose ends and this is definitely a loose end that I think all of you guys forgot about if you've been on this journey from zombies for this long and if you've only been recently during black ops III you might not have even known this existed but I absolutely loved putting this video together for you all and I really hope you enjoyed it now just before we on the video you have a brand new teaser for DLC 3 but more so is a teaser for the overall black ops four operation which we have an image and name which is operation apocalypse so it sounds like not only are we getting the new zombies map Alpha Omega but the entire operation is going to be zombies theme as you can see from the image we have rust man returning which I assume is going to be rust man in black out we even have the black ops 1 soldier from the live-action trailers as a playable character and we also have the transit diner sign at the bottom right with some new looking zombie outfits so if you're skeptical about the live-action trailer of zombie labs returning somehow as Kanaka story in Alpha Omega we now have the burger shop employee from the black ops 1 live-action trailers in blackout either way really appreciate you guys checking out the video and if you enjoyed you know what to do but make sure you do not miss out on future videos like this if you enjoyed it bye scribing right now to the channel and turning on our notification bell as on July 9th we are going to be streaming the heck out of Alpha Omega Easter egg hunting all day and all night until we get it done I can't wait for it and hopefully you guys are the same but thank you so much for checking out my video today and I'll catch you next time

The Moon is pretty hard to miss when it’s
 up at night. It’s big and bright and really very pretty. Even cooler, it’s the closest
 astronomical object in the Universe to us, and arguably, the one we know best. I hate to break it to you, but we humans are
 pretty egotistical. Even though there are over 160 known moons of decent size in our
 solar system, we call ours THE Moon, with a capital M, like it’s the only one, or
 the most important one. And I guess to us it is the most important
 one. It’s only the fifth largest moon in the solar system in absolute size, but compared
 to Earth it’s pretty big; fully a quarter of the diameter of the planet. That’s a
 way bigger ratio than for any other moon orbiting a major planet in the solar system. By the numbers, the Moon is about 3470 kilometers
 in diameter, and on average about 380,000 kilometers from Earth. That means it looks
 pretty big in our sky, but probably not as big as you think. When the moon rises, it can look huge and
 looming on the horizon, like you could fall into it. Ah, but that’s not really the case;
 it’s easy to show it’s the same size on the horizon as it is high overhead. Yet people
 think it looks twice as big when it’s on the horizon! This is the well-known Moon Illusion,
 and it’s due to two factors: how we perceive the sizes of objects, and how we perceive
 the sky. We don’t really see the sky as a hemisphere
 over our heads, but more like a flattened bowl, with the horizon farther away than the
 zenith. So when the Moon’s on the horizon, our brains are convinced it’s farther away.
 But if it’s farther away, it must be physically bigger to appear that size, right? So our
 brain interprets the Moon’s size as HUGE. It’s an illusion, but a convincing one. In fact, the Moon is about the same size as
 a small pill held up at arm’s length! Our satellite is a lot smaller than you think. The internal structure of the Moon is roughly
 similar to the Earth: It has a solid, iron inner core; a liquid outer core, a thick mantle,
 and a crust of lighter material on top. The core is small, probably 350 kilometers in
 radius, and still hot, though not as hot as Earth’s core. The lower mantle may be a
 thick fluid, but unlike Earth’s mantle the upper part is solid. The easiest part of the moon to observe is
 its surface, so of course we know the most about that. The near side, the side we see
 from Earth, is divided into two distinct types of regions: highlands, which are heavily cratered,
 and maria—Latin for “seas”—which are darker and smoother. The craters in the highlands are from countless
 impacts over the eons from asteroids and comets. Rocks from these regions have been dated to
 be well over 4 billion years old — nearly as old as the Moon itself! The maria, on the other hand, don’t have
 nearly as many craters. They’re younger, but that’s relative; rocks from those areas
 appear to be roughly 3-3.5 billion years old on average. The maria are made of darker,
 basaltic material, which means they probably formed from lava flooding older areas. For most of human history, the far side of
 the Moon was hidden from us, but in 1959 the Soviet Union flew the Luna 3 space probe around
 the Moon, photographing the far side for the first time. Everyone expected it to look a
 lot like the near side, but shockingly, it’s vastly different: There were almost no maria!
 That’s weird; the near side is covered with them. And not only that, observations from
 subsequent lunar probes showed the crust on the lunar far side is thicker than it is on
 the near side as well. The Moon is starting to stack up mysteries.
 Why is it so big compared to Earth? Why are the near and far sides so different? It turns
 out the composition of the crust has a lot of similarities to Earth, but also a lot of
 differences as well. Why? It turns out the answers to these questions are all
 related to how the Moon formed 4.5 billion years ago. A lot of ideas have been proposed to figure
 out how the Moon formed, but the best one going these days is called the Giant Impact
 hypothesis. When the solar system formed, there were a lot more objects orbiting the
 Sun than there are now. These ranged in size from grains of dust up to objects the size of planets,
 and that meant there were lots of collisions. No doubt the Earth suffered many such impacts.
 But one happened late in Earth’s history, relatively speaking, roughly 50 million years
 after things started to settle down. A Mars-sized planet, given the unofficial name Theia, slammed
 into our young planet, but it wasn’t a head-on impact; it was a grazing collision. The impact was colossal, blasting a huge amount
 of material from both planets into space. Most of it came from the outer layers of the
 Earth, since the collision was a grazing one. This material rapidly coalesced into the Moon,
 and that explains why there’s some but not total similarity in composition to Earth;
 it used to be part of the Earth. But some of it came from the other planet, too. And
 we may even have some evidence of it; some rocks from the Moon show a peculiar ratio
 of different kinds of oxygen atoms, called isotopes. It’s possible some of the more exotic
 isotopes of oxygen came from the other planet. Actually, this idea has been around for a
 long time, ever since the Apollo missions in the 1970s. There’s a lot of evidence to support
  it, too. But a new twist on it goes farther. When the Moon formed from the debris of the
 collision, it was close to Earth, probably 20,000 kilometers away. The collision was
 so violent that it completely melted the Earth, and the Moon was molten too. Tidal forces
 rapidly synchronized the Moon’s spin and orbital period, so that one face always pointed
 toward Earth. If you were on that side of the Moon, the Earth would dominate the sky, appearing
 80 times larger than the Moon appears in our sky today. And the Earth was hot. It hung there like
 blast furnace, and would’ve seriously heated the near side of the Moon. The far side would’ve
 been much cooler. The material on the near side would’ve vaporized, and a lot of it
 would have condensed on the far side. Over time, this created the thicker far side crust
 we see today. Then there was another seriously terrifying
 event: the Late Heavy Bombardment, a period of intense collisions with comets from the
 outer solar system, probably triggered by the movement of outer planets. This rain of
 millions of comets left scars on all the inner worlds, including the Moon. That’s when
 most of the highland cratering occurred. Some of these collisions were massive, carving
 gigantic craters on the Moon. Later, lava bubbled up through cracks in the Moon’s surface,
 flooding these craters, creating the maria we see today. Ah, but the far side’s crust was thicker.
 Impacts there couldn't get as deep, and it was harder for lava to break through and bubble
 up. That explains why there are so few maria there. This idea that the Earth cooked the Moon and
 formed the crustal anomaly is pretty new, and is still being argued over. There are
 also competing hypotheses about this, as well. As we gather more evidence, we’ll eventually
 get a better understanding of just why the Moon’s crust is so weird. After all that, I have to say: it’s a little
 unfair to divide the lunar surface today into just highlands and maria. For example, craters
 are pretty diverse. Some are small and simple bowl shapes. Others are huge, dozens of kilometers
 across and more, punctuated with a central peak, a mountain in the middle that formed
 as material from the gigantic impact that formed it splashed back up in the middle.
 Double craters are common too, probably formed when binary asteroids hit the Moon. There
 are also crater chains: long lines of small craters that may have formed when a nearby large
 impact splashed out long streamers of material. Rays are common from big craters, too. These
 are extremely long “splash marks” pointing radially out from the impacts, probably formed
 when plumes of material were ejected. Some of the brightest are from the crater Tycho
 in the Moon’s southern hemisphere, and they stretch for 1500 kilometers. The material
 is a bit more reflective than the surrounding terrain, so they appear bright in contrast,
 and are one of the most outstanding features visible near the time of the full Moon. And there’s so much more! Long, sinuous
 rilles like dry river beds wind their way across the surface, actually the sites of
 ancient lava flows. There are lava tubes as well, where the top of a lava flow cooled
 and formed a tunnel through which lava could flow for long distances. Sometimes the roof,
 as it’s called, collapses and forms a skylight, and we can see into the otherwise hidden tunnel. There are also cliffs, mounds, ancient and
 quite dead volcanoes, even mountain chains! There’s no tectonic activity on the Moon,
 but mountain ranges formed at the edges of giant impacts, where the huge forces unleashed
 pushed up the rocks at the crater rim. And new observations show there’s something
 else on the Moon, too: Water. Deep craters near the Moon’s poles have floors that never
 see sunlight. Comet impacts can distribute water all over the Moon, but most of it is
 destroyed by sunlight. But it can collect in these dark craters, and studies show there
 could be over a billion tons of water there in the form of ice. That would be a huge boon
 to colonization; water is heavy and really expensive to transport from Earth. If it’s already on
 the Moon, that makes it a lot easier to put people there. And that’s in our future, I have no doubt.
 We’re starting to get serious about going back to the Moon; NASA has plans of returning,
 and other countries like China and India are looking Moonward as well. It’s not a matter
 of if, but when. And it could be soon - so soon that, I’d bet, there’s a really good
 chance the next person to step foot on the Moon is already alive. Perhaps some teenage
 student in some country is just now taking an interest in science, math, engineering
 - an interest that will one day will lead to another giant leap for humanity. Today you learned that the capital-M Moon
 is a lower-case-m-moon. It’s big compared to Earth, and is thought to have formed when
 a small planet impacted Earth at a grazing angle. It’s heavily cratered, and has huge
 flood plains on it called maria. There’s water there, too, just waiting for us to thaw
 it out and drink it. Crash Course Astronomy is produced in association

world's leading music streaming service and now it can be your go-to for podcasts too hello everybody hello welcome back to a space news pod live daily podcast about space science and tech where we discuss all sorts of cool Spacey things not just space though human stuff last night we got onto the discussion about humans in space how we're going to be treating other things other beings as we meet them as we travel through the cosmos that's one of the topics that usually comes up people are pretty excited about that what would happen if you're on another planet you're on another world maybe a moon and sell it as possibly and it dig into the surface and what happens if you dig out the last remaining bacteria that are alive that world we just you're the destroyer of worlds at that point destroyed everything there was one of the topics that came up in one of the other episodes I don't know if it was last night it might have been the night before man these are so fun I love the love the live format and I want to say thank you to everybody who's been checking them out you check it a moot for all you uh Canadians out there that's how I translate to you check a moot now that being said what is happening with NASA nASA has been hacked JPL had been hacked JPL had a raspberry pie attack actually so this is what happened NASA confirmed that JPL has been hacked an audit document was released from the US Office of the Inspector General it was published by NASA in it reveals that an unauthorized Raspberry Pi computer connected to the GPL servers was targeted by hackers who then moved further into the NASA network they got access to the Deep Space Network array of radio telescopes and numerous other JPL systems while they were in there so Johnson Space Center who is responsible for the International Space Station amongst other programs pulled the plug they cut it off they didn't have any sort of communication their computers didn't communicate basically with JPL after this they said nope we can't handle this we don't want all of our stuff to be hacked to so we're going to block you guys off we're gonna discontinue communication with you via computer systems now I don't know if anybody's ever seen Battlestar Galactica here well that's what happened in Battlestar Galactica when the Cylons attacked they were hacking everything so they went back to old school technology basically ham radio style where there's no direct connection so you know it's not as crazy as that but basically they said okay so this is what's happening we're getting hacked we don't want to be hacked even further so what we're gonna do is put up this firewall we're not going to communicate our computers aren't going to communicate with GPL servers that have been hacked so it's serious it's serious stuff and the reason why it's serious is because NASA not only like they don't only do space stuff you know everybody knows that NASA does sanitary things they do science up in the stars up in the cosmos but they also have a lot of really interesting and important technology that they're working on at all times in some nations would literally kill to get this sort of technology so these kind of hacks aren't just important as far as science goes and destroying the science that's already there at the Deep Space Network of telescopes if they got ahold of that information and they destroyed it all that would be horrible you know what if they hacked into the storage centers and destroyed so much data that you know we wouldn't be able to you know get the data back thank you for those five likes yo here what's up man and so you know that's one of the things that could happen but also they're working on technologies that the public hasn't seen yet they're working on things at NASA that you know they're not quite top-secret but they're also technologies that other countries don't have so aerospace technologies that can make other nations more deadly that's a thing that's the thing that they do at NASA they make arrows picked up aerospace technologies they have the stuff at NASA the blueprints so to speak at NASA the files that have the information about better flight systems new materials things like that it's all in esse so if this hack were to continue further on it's possible that it wouldn't just stop at JPL it would have infiltrated further so hackers Mike's still be in the network it's possible it's possible they have a backdoor somewhere now so they're going to be doing an audit in the next 30 to 60 days to make sure that everything is all good so it's the thing that is possible we live in a connected Society thank you for those five likes Peter appreciate it looking up the Stars last night I saw two satellites between five 10 minutes of each other dude you know how big satellites are out there it's crazy it's crazy you look up at night and you can see shooting stars satellites the ISS the ISS is one of those things that you can actually sign up to get updates for the ISS when it comes over spot the station dot-gov I think it is spot the station it gets org spot the station nasa.gov I'm gonna set a link quick into chat and then you can have there you go so there if you check that out you can see when the station is gonna be over your house let me let me see what its gonna be a white house the next sighting opportunity for me will be Saturday June 29th for four minutes at 4:26 a.m. ugh I've seen it a decent time but I'm not gonna wake up at 4:26 a.m. to see the space station again though it's cool I love it it's amazing but it's not wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning cool it's just a little dot it's cool it's you can definitely tell it's a space station that it's not a star it's not a moon you know it's nothing like that it's completely different it's brighter than a lot of stuff and it has a straight flight path goes right across the sky it's really cool man it's really cool I think you dig it Peter so I'm doing these live podcasts now and I appreciate everybody hanging out for them but I also do regular podcasts like 10-minute hits like a clip kind of thing every single day so if you go to space news pod com you can check that out as well and those are you know those are more produced and they're possibly some of them are possibly parts of the live broadcasts and I want to give those things to people that want them the short podcasts I want people to know that you know hey I'm still doing short podcasts because a lot of people joined up for my podcast because they like the short format the ten-minute format 10-minute less format so I want to make sure everyone's happy and those are called clips now so I'm gonna have a whole array of clips for people to check out it's gonna be around 10 minutes so NASA speaking of NASA and their security stuff NASA has a rover on Mars right now the Curiosity rover and it has detected that there are readings in Martian atmosphere there's some gas that could be a sign of microbes living on Mars right now Mars rover Curiosity discovered high amounts of methane in the Martian air a gas that on earth usually produces living things data arrived last Tuesday Friday excuse me Friday scientists that were on the mission discussed the news they didn't put out a press release or anything no NASA stuff they used the weekend to follow up on the experiment just to make sure that everything's cool because when something like this happens and you know that there are really cool implications here methane is produced by living things especially in high volumes cow farts just as a thing cow farts methane living thing it produces methane it's a it's a side effect of being alive basically so there's possibly life on Mars there's possibly Martian microbes excreting methane right now it's also possible that these aren't just microbes because there's methane in the atmosphere methane if it's in the Martian air it's significant because sunlight and chemical reactions break up molecules within a few centuries so any methane that's been detected recently is due to a recent methane burst so there's some stuff on earth methanogens they thrive in places that lack oxygen underground digestive tracts of animals and they release methane as a waste product and also geothermal reactions can make methane as well so it is quite possible that we stumbled upon something that's just geothermal and it's just spewing out a little bit of methane but it's also possible that we have stumbled upon microbes on the Martian surface so there's no real results yet no real results there's no things that have happened there's no evidence quite yet then it's a living thing but there is a possibility that it's they're supportive puffy puppy wolf also gotta ask when are we able to go to moon easily thank you for those five likes what are we going to go to the moon easily we're going in 2024 if all goes well if NASA's plan goes well and if the administration keeps going Congress keeps going everybody keeps giving up funding they need 30 billion dollars to get to the moon they recently asked for 1.6 billion to get the thing get this party started and unfortunately they were turned down by the government and they said ok we need more information we need reasons why we're gonna give you this 30 million dollars I mean regular people not astronauts ok so that's a thing Elon Musk wants to send starship around the moon go around the moon come back to earth land on earth and let's see when they want to do that I can't remember I think he's within the next 10 years I'm gonna look this up real quick so I know exactly what it is she's sending a billionaire a lunar billionaire gonna be the first private passenger to go around the moon let's see I'm just looking it up real quick making sure it's gonna cost them a bunch of money by the way there we go so they want to send them around the moon as early as 2023 so in a couple years so that's gonna be a trip around them right with SpaceX exactly I heard he sent a car or something he did yet in one of the launches just to kind of demonstrate what kind of payloads one of the Rockets can handle he sent a car into space and that was pretty cool so now Starman is headed toward the sun it's your ultimate dream to go to the moon I think it would be really cool what podcasts do you guys listen to I listen to all sorts of podcasts I'm all over the place Joe Rogan of course I listen to Neil deGrasse Tyson start rock star talk radio what else do I got all sorts of him I'd listen to some skateboard podcasts I'm a little old-school skateboarder so I'm still interested in that sport and he uses a technology like blockchain I'm not sure what technology they're using for that but yeah they're using all sorts of crazy technologies to get people to the moon and around the moon listen to the Conan O'Brien podcast if you haven't listened to the Conan O'Brien podcast and you're a fan of comedy and absurd humor the Conan O'Brien oh there we go yeah the Conan O'Brien podcast is amazing I've been a big fan of Conan for a really long time so his podcast is absolutely amazing I love it so yeah go check it out actually stay here first listen to this if you want to learn stuff and then go over and listen to Conan Conan is an awesome awesome podcast so in order to get regular people to the moon we have to get astronauts to the moon first we have to get people who are trained to go to the moon so they're doing that whole process right now they're starting that process they're using technologies from you know SpaceX possibly Blue Origin to land Blue Origin as Jeff Bezos the the Amazon okay the founder of Amazon so he has a rocket company he has a space company he built a moon lander and it's possible that they will be using the Blue Origin moon lander to land astronauts on the moon in five years Oh Lissie yeah his ads are amazing it's ads are absolutely amazing it's they're all hysterical and I love them we did we have sent astronauts to the moon and that's a fact I mean that's funny how when people like to you know bring up the conspiracy theories it's kind of funny how when you say well you don't actually have any proof that the conspiracy is real and then they to come back with all this stuff because in their heads when they start this whole process a lot gotta prove that the moon landing is fake they don't do the whole scientific process of getting all the you get all the information then you you know you come up with a conclusion thank you for those five likes by the way so there's a lot of there's a lot of weirdos out there if we haven't gone to the moon that is the biggest cover-up in human history because there were thousands and thousands of people that were invested and working for those things for that mission that should have squealed by now should have been a stool pigeon should have said something along the lines of hey I don't know why I'm working on this project because we're not actually going there there's just like a soundstage in Hollywood that like this dude that made like 2001 Space Odyssey like he's totally making this cool movie and he's also making a movie about astronauts going to the moon for NASA and the US government am i ruling that out there's also no reason to rule it out completely because some of the photos that you'll see of astronauts and things in space you'll see that they're kind of their PR photos so they may have been taken on the soundstage they may have been taking on taking on some other area but I was listening to Joe Rogan podcast actually the other day and he brought that up he brought up that that idea okay so there are some photos that they used PR photos is your first name space in my last name is news pod no my name is will by the way so he brought that up and I went through and I know that there are some things like that there are some photos that have been doctored a little bit for basically for press releases for press release things to TV studios will I am I am will and there are a lot of those things out there so of course they think that okay everything's fake then no man it's not it's not get your head on your butt think about it like this you have a deadline your deadline is oh hey the president says Tuesday at four o'clock we need a picture of an astronaut so we can go on TV and show everybody how cool the astronauts are right now but we don't have any good pictures because it is horribly hard to take a photo in space and send it back to earth in that time like with that technology back then there's no way you know like you can't you just can't do it so basically what happens is they have press photos that they took beforehand that they're because they're practicing these moves right so they practice all these things on in pools on wires you know things like that so they can kind of figure out what they're gonna feel like when they get to space and they made mock I actually did they made like a soundstage they made like basically like a stage so they could practice things so because you don't want to go to the moon and be like how do I walk how do I walk that's a thing there's not as much gravity how am I gonna walk when I get to the moon so they made it's a training ground for them so they take photos of that you know there's probably somebody you know there's taking photos of them while they're doing their work and they needed a press release for whatever TV a newspaper a magazine something like that so there's a press crew that's at NASA and I work with them sometimes you know you call them up you're like hey can I go to a rocket launch and they say yeah you're cool come on down here's some press stuff for you and you just they give you things that you know are photoshopped by Lindsey so that's what it comes out to comes down to basically like a PR person flipping a photo around and saying hey this is this good enough for the magazine and then all of a sudden it's a conspiracy and everybody is against the government and there's YouTube videos millions of YouTube videos out there and it's possible that you know some of the stuff was real you know that some of the stuff some of the things that they were they're complaining about like oh yeah there's the moon you know the guy on the moon with the flag is weird or whatever there's a sure there was a soundstage of course like we're not stupid they were doing their practice drills unless the Elon Musk eat-down existence yeah same here man you know in those kind of things like the virtual reality thing if you think about it those things have always been kind of always around from the beginning of humanity like why are we here what are we doing what is this what is this existence you know different cultures have different ways to explain how humanity has become a thing and if right now because we're doing it we're in technology is us we are part of Technology we're kind of in this relationship where we use technology constantly whether I'm sitting in front of the studio microphone in front of two monitors looking at space news or if I'm on my phone while I'm driving listening to podcasts I'm always connected to some sort of technology there's technology my car this technology my shoes so of course we think about it all the time we think about technology constantly hi everyone I would have let you know about anchor FM that's where I host my podcast and I find that it's the easiest place to do that and it gives you everything that you need in one place for free which you can start podcasting from your phone or from your computer you don't need special crazy equipment to start doing it you can talk into your phone you don't need editing equipment that costs thousands of dollars to start a podcast you can do it from anywhere and when you're done recording your episode anchored at FM we'll distribute it so it can be heard everywhere on Spotify Apple podcast Google podcasts stitcher every place that podcast can be heard and you can make money with your podcast it's pretty simple there's no minimum listenership to start making money with anchor so if you want to make a little bit of money while having a cool podcast well download the egg crap or go to Ankara dot FM to get started and then could it be a hologram could it be virtual reality could we have somebody playing The Sims with us are we a video game to something are we somebody's you know a higher power could we be an ant colony so to speak they're just figuring out what we do you know they they check out our house they're checking me out right now they're like look at this guy he's wearing shorts why is he wearing shorts he has an air conditioner on what is it they were like you know I was here his air conditioner on it's not that hot you know they think about maybe they think about that right why do they need comas here yet because I don't have to that's why because I don't have to because this is my job I don't have to look good yeah so it's like they did what the weird thing is man the weird thing is that if there's an omni prison being that's checking us out all the time why are we ashamed you know like why why would you be ashamed of anything of who you are or what you're doing because who cares at that point like this thing this being is watching you anyway is how your being is watching you all the time anyway so you know you're gonna interact with these other people and feel ashame for who you are I see a lot of people you know because of their religion or because of their their beliefs they're ashamed of who they are and they hide who they are and eventually they're like okay I'm screwing I'm just gonna be me and we have sort of like a midlife crisis kind of thing and like to just be you man just be you I've had you know if you had to tell so many people just be yourself you know no one's gonna care no one's gonna care just do your thing man and if you think about it like that like in the broad spectrum of everything thank you for those likes by the way Joseph the broad spectrum thing millions and millions billions of years who really cares 15 billion years ago things were formed star has made us the earth was made you know billions of years ago as well and at this point time we just happen to be humans and we happen to have society that puts pressure on you for no reason and they give you these rules that sort of kind of dictate your life thank you for those applause appreciate that and when you you know when you continue down that path of following those rules of us address this way if the do these certain things and you have to conform to these ideals what's that for that's not for you that's for them I've always been the person that's kind of been I you know a little bit of an outlier I wasn't too bad I always had friends with everybody but I always did my own thing and I was a weirdo and had green hair when I was growing up and you know I was a 90s punk kid I still listen to punk rock now I'm like a 40 year old dude was in the punk rock you know damn the man fight the power kind of thing but it's like just do your thing have fun enjoy yourself like you got 70 years man do it do you think it's all an accident it's possible you said it's all an accident but it just it happened is so perfectly that you have to think that there was a purpose you have to have to put that in your head a little bit is there a purpose all of this because what if we're the only planet this supports life if we're the only planet that supports life we're going to be the only life in the whole universe and how crazy is that we're not alone we have each other so if we are alone in the universe we're not alone on this planet find the people that you love find the people that will accept you for who you are and cling to them I know we're a creepy way just cling to them make sure that they know you you care about them and make sure that you know you hang out with them a lot let them know so why do billions of planets do is this to make us think to make us wander to make us wonder I don't know those are the things that break into your head every once in a while if we're the only planet that has life the big question is are we alone billions of light-years away there's a planet somewhere to is that has some of the building blocks of life but life hasn't really made it to a certain stage yet it hasn't made it into actually like a life a single-celled organism so they're not there yet we can't get there we don't have a rocket powerful enough we can't bend space-time so we can't get there and there's no way for us to know if that planet will ever harbor life so if we get to the point where we can actually bend space-time and fold the universe somehow with some sort of technology which would be an insane amount of power that we would possess at that point we could get to other planets we could check them out we can make sure that we're not alone we could go communicate with these other beings is that gonna happen in our lifetimes more than likely not there's nothing out there right now that's going to warp space-time in order for us to move our lazy butts off this planet onto into another galaxy you know another maybe another universe we saw things on TV like UFOs and aliens aliens are a weird subject think about the kinds of people that say that aliens are real they're kind of outliers a little bit weird but they're always skeptic about everything they seem to be skeptic about things but I'm not saying that's not a possibility it's a possibility but there's no evidence there's no evidence of people going to a spacecraft being probed or whatever they get whatever got done to them and then like just coming back like no big deal like it's no big deal okay cool you went up there you talk to these aliens and you just come back with a memory and that's it there's no one like physical proof you couldn't just you know grab something when you're up there there's got to be something look around grab I mean it's got to be dusty or something up there grab a like a handful of dirt grab a hair sample or something a toenail I don't know something another girl like there's probably like one gross alien on that spaceship it's like cut his toenails in the middle of the spaceship it doesn't leave em on the ground you're freaking out because you're on this spaceship you're trying to survive but you know if you're on a spaceship you know you have a story to tell so you need evidence so people will believe you when you get back to earth so just grab something something gross something weird something just anything put in your pocket put it under your armpit anywhere that you can put it in your mouth under your tongue did probably you know if you're in an alien spacecraft you're probably gonna die anyway if they don't let you go so might as well start eating some sort of alien whatever put in your mouth and bring it back to earth and then he could be like look I got this from an alien spacecraft it's been debunked since the beginning of alien spacecrafts being seen by humans and all this service started happening like we go back to the the being in a simulation thing it all sort of sort of started happening when area 51 you know UFOs that started becoming cool science fiction people started seeing UFOs because they started seeing them on TV and you know they kind of incorporated that into their own minds and the mind is only a place so it might I'll Jack you up when you're sleeping and you have a weird nightmare of an alien that's like stealing you from the earth and doing bad things to you you're gonna get jacked and they're gonna send you back down here but that's only because you know they've heard it before the only people that get a benefit from these UFOs are politicians and the people that say the story is because they can write a book they can have a blog they can have a YouTube channel they can make money um you know those kind of people they take advantage of it and you know it's fun to believe it's fun to believe those things it's not science but it like that's cool too it's entertainment you know if you listen to a bunch of UFO you apologists it's entertaining they have TV shows you know they're hosted TV shows they get paid a lot of money to do that stuff a lot more than I do to get a podcast go on so you know they do have a bad fit for that exactly bad why are they hiding why are you hiding why are these aliens just kind of like in the lurking in the darkness just come out man oh they don't come out because they don't come out because they don't want us to know everything they have superior technology and my mom and my dad were part of the CIA when I was child okay dude that's exactly the kind of people the that's why people make so much money because they make up those stories and storytellers have always been important to society because they make you think and they make you imagine you know you go to a movie and it's the same thing it's a story and it makes you believe for a moment that you're there that you're experiencing these things and if you're a great storyteller you put yourself in this a UFO with these aliens and you're part of that whole thing it's like old radio dramas the ships he worked on oh you know what I kind of watched that Bob Lazar thing on Netflix that looks awesome I do want to watch it because I think it'll be really fun to watch that I put that on my list for the night I think there are more on earth and they're used back with the pyramids real as well as lost when the last ice age wiped everyone out it's you know man it's possible it's possible I'm not I'm never gonna say it's not possible because I don't know like I'm not an alien I never crashed ship here right we'll never know who knows and we possibly came from another star system we possibly came from an asteroid oh yeah gotta what listen to that Joe Rogan's show - I'm a big fan of Joe so I want to definitely listen to that one I haven't got a chance to yet but it's possible that we came from an asteroid or meteor that slammed into the surface of the earth and brought the chemicals that were needed to create life to our planet yep exactly crash boom bang we got all this stuff on earth that we need to make life okay let's make some single-cell organisms let's move from there and maybe that's it maybe that's how life starts maybe it's a weird chain reaction maybe life doesn't start on planets maybe it's too weird and hot when pine nuts get made I don't know I don't know how that I'm not a expert at how all this stuff comes to be but it's possible maybe that's the transform transfer mechanism and I'm just throwing things out there like I'm sort of like I'm the everyman so somebody told me on Twitter the other days they said I love your show because you're the everyman you're not a brainy scientist and I'm like yeah I'm not I'm not a brainy scientist I just love this stuff I'd love to think about you know all the cool stuff that happens all the time like freaking we found methane on Mars a couple days ago like last week last Tuesday a large amount of methane so it could be geology going poof making methane it was detected but it could also be microbes shooting out methane the Red Planet so it's a it's up for grabs right now they're still doing more research and more science on it so we'll know in the next week or so if they're gonna do any more studies I'm sure they're gonna be doing a lot of studies but they're going to be doing more experiments up on Mars with the Curiosity rover about that you know every alien is human you know I noticed that to pet that every time that somebody says like you know oh I went up to the spaceship and they told me and then they spoke in English whatever they told them that it seems like oh how did they know English they're all knowing they're all seeing they're like an amazing being from another star system and they traveled here just to see me because I'm special they came out to my farm they slaughtered a bunch of cows and then the tractor beam me up into their into their base their mothership then I was asked questions they did Studies on my body look they know everything can't they just be mat around yet do they have like a detector at that point if they're that intelligent when they just be able to be like boop boop you know with a little laser beam and say hey that's a humanoid it has all these things wrong with it it has all these diseases these are the organs that Brennan this is the skeletal structure these are you know these are the genders on earth these are the things and that's a cow and that's a horse and you know what they be able to do that that would be pretty simple if you could travel across the freakin universe yeah it's it's one of those it's a silly silly thing but it's entertaining i I don't mind and I think you know there's a place there's a purpose for it for some people they know much more about bars and they tell us maybe I mean they I don't think it's like they're trying to hold anything back from us I think they just have so much data you know it's all about science with Mars drovers and things like that there's no I don't think there's a big conspiracy about that kind of stuff I think there's just so much data that's coming and flooding in and there's not enough people to look through it there's AI this checking it out and there's a like a ton of scientists that are looking through it scrubbing through the data looking at all the pictures but we just don't have the technology to do anything cool like that they don't fly like discs or frisbees how do they fly them because all I've known is the cigar shape belly forward huh interesting there be a lot of drag in our atmosphere unless there's a wave of course for them to split that up I mean there alias and they probably have the technology to split up our atmosphere right as they're going through an ester careening through our planet's atmosphere the points where it wants to go and then they can't figure how it zooms yeah it's a seems like a technology that's way above our heads we above our pay grades way above my pay grade like Wi-Fi tech that's been used in spaceship years ago but for regular people not for long well that's the profits the thing so NASA is really good about developing new technologies hello I don't want to put your name but I think your name is nae Nahum but hello welcome to the show so NASA builds all these technologies for their missions right whether it's Rover tires or you know it's a camera on Mars something like that the technology has to be built these insanely difficult strenuous stressful missions and when they get done with that technology they release it to the public you know their days say okay well we have we need to get this stuff done right so they need this cool let's just say it's a camera do but they need a high-tech camera what are they how are they going to build that they hire somebody to build that camera sometimes they hire somebody sometimes to do it in-house most of the time when it comes to technology they'll get parts from other companies they do build things in-house though just want to let's do that and that being said once it's all done people can you know use those technology with either they pay for them because there's patents or the open sourcing and everyone can use whatever they want to use and if that's the case then somebody can pick that up and make whatever they want to with it people are smart people will make really cool stuff man ooh hello people will make amazing things with the technologies and with the things that they've been given so for example if somebody has resources to manufacture a chipset for the camera to say a camera from ours so that chipset will be used possibly thank you for that follow for a future smartphone camera they'll put it in the consumers hands and first it's gonna suck the first camera phones really sucked just the same and now there are little square images they have very horrible resolution but those were technologies that were made by you know NASA its partners companies out there that wanted to take advantage of these things with somebody billionaires today why isn't that you want Batman that's a good question I think if you have billions of dollars you want to solve problems and leave the crime up to the cops but there are I'm sure there are Batman's I'm sure there are I'm sure there's people out there they're super rich and want to fight crime so yeah these technologies get pushed out into the public and you can make cool things like our phones are at basically a direct ancestor of the Apollo mission so yeah so that you know that that takes care of that as far as the technology goes what are your thoughts about blockchain technology I don't really know a lot about it to be honest with you so I don't want to really comment on it I know it's a public ledger possible I bought a little bit of Bitcoin a little while ago about like 10 bucks just to see how to do it and I mined some XMR at one point but I don't really know too much about blockchain technology other than so what's I guess my question is what's the difference between and I'll look this up later but my my big thing is like whoa it's just a database right it's a big database of stuff that always happens so if it's the same thing as a database why don't we just use a database to do data things and like that just mean being naive about the technology because I don't really know anything about it yet and I'd have to like I said before I have to look into it and hopefully get a kind of a grasp on how it all works I kind of understand you know the public ledger for Bitcoin that's understandable I get that but it's also it's basically a database to me like it's storing data for the public that's a public celebrity because it's the public's money invests in this private company yeah basically NASA money all these launches it's all our money you know it's taxpayers money that are sending these things into space and Elon is one of the people then has the technology and the company to build rockets that will take our money and do cool things with it doing great things oh man he is a he's a superstar Edelen musk is a superstar everyone knows who Elon Musk is it's the only musk on your main or Lex Luthor I think he's more iron man than Lots Luthor spread over a large swath of computers for accountability and transparency okay so that makes sense that makes more sense to me instead of having a centralized location because it's decentralized anybody can access the blockchain at any time that makes more sense NASA NASA is mysterious no one likes them I think everybody likes NASA yeah and then you can mine the blocks right so I mind a couple XM ours not a couple XM ours because I'd be I'd have a little bit more than like three dollars now but you can mind like I mind a couple I don't know what satoshis at one point Bitcoin satoshis I don't even know where my wallet is but it wasn't you know I didn't mind up a Bitcoin or anything so I didn't have any worth so yeah my my watching knowledge is very limited it's a cool technology though as far as I'm concerned I mean if it's making things easier and making things more transparent anything that does that especially when it comes to money is really cool especially when it comes to you know a public ledger of things that happened that's cool you know I like digital currency I think it's really neat I think paper money is still gonna be here for a long time because if we go to a digital currency people are gonna freak the eff out people couldn't make you know they're gonna freak out I use this example the other night on the show I went to a store I went to an autozone you know a large auto store in America huge huge footprint is all over the country I went to Autozone and I used my Apple pay to pay for an air filter for my car the guy behind the counter was like using cash cash or credit and he was like he's from around here but he talks like a southerner I'm in New York so I don't know why he's talking like a southerner but I digress he's kind of a redneck just saying I've got a redneck - I grew up in the forest but yeah this guy said cash a credit and I said I'm gonna be paying with my phone so so uh Apple pay and he he just looked at me like uh what is that and then a DoubleTap throwing paid for it all done no one's ever done that here before all right there okay well all done I was like yeah I use it all the time but that was one of the things like instead this is the next evolution phones in the next evolution of payment and then if it's digital currency people are gonna freak the eff out because they don't have their money in their pocket the guy said oh I only use cash because I know where my money's going I said that's dad that makes sense what's your opinion about American cyberattack recently launched on Iran I don't have an opinion on that because I don't really like to get into politics on this podcast that much if it involves space or science then I'll get into it but thank you for those likes by the way and thank you for all the follows thank you for all the stars two stars really helped because I do this every night for free and those stars really help fund my coffee while I do this so I don't think digital currency I would really love for it to work like that and would really love for currencies not the new Facebook currency I would think that should burn in hell it's weird and it's going to anything to do with Facebook and money is not the right thing to do keep my privacy with my money doing the things that I want to do with it wherever I want to do it whenever with whatever I want to do with that's mine I don't want Facebook or anybody building ads because of what I spent money on it's a weird weird prospect they do that now I want to buy things on Amazon I get ads on Google you know like a month later like you know hey you need a new toothbrush like they're not really oh because I bought a toothbrush a little bit ago mm-hmm okay Dan I haven't watched yet I really want to watch it and I'll probably watch it tonight to be honest with you and then I'll come back tomorrow and comment on it hey Lindsay hello again yeah I'll watch that tonight for sure and I actually I've been watching okay so these these guys are my partners Magellan TV they have helped me out a ton with the show and you can get two months for free it's all space and science documentaries and documentaries about science humans like culture history all sorts of really crazy stuff if you go to Magellan tv.com slash space news pod you get two months for free I just I'm about halfway through the show called black holes the other side of infinity and it's freaking terrifying terrifying what black holes are billions of times as big as our Sun and they rip the universe apart they rip space-time they put a hole in it they pop a hole in space-time and things fall into them it's freakin insane so I've been watching this documentary and if you really like that kind of stuff I would suggest going to Magellan tv.com slash space news pod two months for free of course then after that it's only $4.99 a month if you continue your subscription but there's cool stuff like that on there and they're really cool people they partnered with me because I saw their saw one of the shows which one was it that I saw the first time but their black hole went black holes fascinate me birth of a black hole was what I was called yeah I can I can write you a link here one second let me do there we go yeah check that out dan you can check that out at that link below - yeah thanks for checking that out - it really helps you know every click on that link or everyone that buys a subscription are against the two months for free really does help out the show because Magellan is they've partnered with me and I'd like to be honest with everybody because you know they pay for headspace basically but it's something that I believe in and it's something that and there's nothing like if there's something on my show that I promote it's because I believe in it it's not because I get tons of money for him because you know make a ton of money podcasting unless you're somebody like Joe Rogan or somebody like Conan O'Brien who has millions of downloads every episode so you know I'm just gonna be straight up with you guys I don't get money as $1 per episode I do this because I love it but I also do it I do this for a living so I don't make a ton of money doing it but I do it nonetheless I'd rather do this than anything else and thank you for all those follows guys appreciate that so yeah I would rather do this than anything else in the world and I made that happen how much does Rogan make oh my god uh he makes let's just say I've let's see every and this is just kind of like a broad statement like a broad swath possibly just say $35 per thousand downloads let's say somewhere around there I don't have a calculator I mean listen here so if he gets at nine figures a year yeah he's he's loaded man millions and millions of dollars so and this is just so like just eight $35 per thousand downloads and he probably gets a million million and a half per episode downloads or more probably 2 million for someone from 3 million probably for some of them I'm not sure what this what the numbers are but he has a enormous amount of people that download a show and people will watch him on YouTube the Magellan app yeah I get the Magellan app it's cool it's a really good app designed very well so he's making Bank man same with Conan Conan's like he does it for fun and he enjoys it but man those guys are making Bank making mad mad money yeah Conan's changing media it's kind of weird isn't it like you get to you get to do fun things that no one's gonna be your boss and that was the thing why I kind of started this is because I am I'm kind of still a web developer I do front-end web development but I do it for fun now that I do it kind of as a one-off thing if I if somebody needs a project done then you know they need me to do it then sure I'll do it but I'm focusing on this and I don't have a boss right now because I focus on this so what kind of you know like that's what I was talking about before you know there's societal pressures to do what's kind of the right thing you know the the thing that everybody wants you to do they want you to make a bunch of money well there's no option to pay with cryptocurrency yeah I don't know I'll talk to him I'll see if there's the thing I'll see if there's a way to do it but yeah there's a there's a there's a part of me that's always not done the right thing you know not done the normal thing I'd never go to college never at the school I kind of I just kind of made my own path I was an athlete and I just kind of did my own thing and wandered around for a little while I kind of lucked into web development because it was sort of a new thing back then and not many people were doing it was the wild wild west back so I got into it because it was new and exciting and then after 15 years I was just like hmm it's been a boys club man I don't like it too many cocky too many jerks and that like it's not from my personal experience there are some really amazing people they work in this place but it's also hyper competitive hyper crazy competitive and you know what man not only that once Yolo as the kids say hashtag Yolo that's what they still say right and I got 70 years I might as well make the last 35 of them or so really good and doing the thing that I actually love and you know say yellow I think anyone said Yolo in like 10 years like at least three years I think everyone said Yolo so yeah that's that's where my journey has taken me and I've had a journeyman's kind of career as far as a lot of different different careers throughout my life lived many places done a lot of different things but this is by far my favorite thing to do Thank You Joshua for that I appreciate that man so yeah the the wild wild west of web coding is gone it's a big corporation now there's giant companies that are trying to make millions of millions of dollars and I feel like the front end developers of the world you know the the bosses make a lot of money of course and then higher up from them make a lot of money the company's corporations make millions the developers make a pretty good living like a really good living like I made a bunch of money and I'm not like I'm not gonna say that I was rich but I wasn't poor at a great paycheck coming in every week and I left it all so I was just like I'm I'm over it and a little bit of savings and I thought I'd pursue this hey no worries man I really liked enjoying I really enjoyed having a conversation about change stuff with you and make sure to follow it so you can come back next time then because I do this every night so on that note - I think I'm gonna take off because I got to take my dad downtown he has a lot of stuff he has a lot of running around as he is he would say to do so I'm his ride what time you start the show about seven o'clock Eastern every night glad you're here Josh I appreciate you stopping by man and make sure you check out the the other podcast too there it's the real let the real one this is like that's the edited version of the podcast so if you get a chance check that out I have a YouTube channel youtube.com slash space news pod that's kind of yeah it's kind of a it's a rework of the podcast as well so if you're India to check that out and I'm working on new content for that as well so my friends I want to say thank you for taking the time out of your day to spend it here with me and thank you for all of the support my friends and hopefully you enjoy your night because I'm gonna go hang out with my dad and I will see you soon you

#iskall85",HermitCraft 6: 118 | GIVE ME THE MOON,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCqlgJAgNOg,0,304664,11825,145,3845,YCqlgJAgNOg,hello ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to another episode of hermie craft season six today we're starting things off in the storage facilities which as you can see are still not still not very finished we definitely still need to install something on this wall here but I just gotta say I'm so happy with how this place is turning out and I'll I'll be I'll I'll admit it that it does it does look like an Xbox it reminds me of an Xbox and also from over here that Island over there is actually looking supercool illuminated in the night that Island is lit up and something I did on a stream quite a while ago boom when I was building the Guardian farm just to block spawns so that we wouldn't get any sports over and I think yeah I think that looks really cool in the background doesn't it it's really fancy but the reason we're starting things off in the storage room that we built last time is because I wanted to show you all that I've been working a little bit on the interior background sort of thing for this thing and one thing that I've really started enjoying doing lately and I don't know if this is just me but encasing redstone and making it visible in some sort it's actually quite fun as long as the redstone is sort of symmetric so I did that here and I think that looks really cool and we also have access to the shell key box reloading system just like I did in my lab or in there in the glacier pace and yeah I mean this thing is really really really really nice I love it but you have to put something up there though because I don't like the ice looking like that but better yet since last episode I have cleaned this mess up if you remember there was a massive green mess or I mean a message a missing a giant chest mess right over here and all of that is gone this here is just potatoes for the villagers so that I can breed them that being said though this happened here wait a minute we got a triple a trio of skeleton oversee and a trio and the villagers I really need to get to my village training centre ASAP who this this is this is really bad with all this being said though we are actually going to leave the island for today I want to head over or shall I say I need to head over to hermit Ville yep there's been some development in the Sahara street or on Sahara Street I've heard and we gotta go and check it out I mean this is getting into a bad meme at this moment in time but I still need another tunnel I still so badly need a no I keep putting it off it's one of those things that yeah it's scarily big project so good old hermit ville and oh my goodness hold on is there manboobs bus this looks insane this looks incredible Wow oh my goodness that's so cool wait a minute what happened what no wait it's turn into the aquarium right it's totally an aquarium there are fishes swimming in there this is so weird okay so I knew about this thing I've seen that scar turned his monster SCARA into a wizard era wizard SCARA and yeah that looks amazing I knew about that I had no idea about this but absolutely no idea about this and neither did I haven't I any idea that rainbow was turned into a flying space here oh this looks incredible and by the looks of things Ren's boss ASAP it's quite far up quite far up 219 wait two hundred and nineteen point five okay well this is kind of this is kind of weird all right I can't fly into that but I is there any signs or anything here hello Batman no it's ah you guys said it in the comments I forgot testificandum yes I am genuinely very shocked over this idea who's done this it looks really cool I mean it got a fits it kind of works ah-ha yeah this is this is completely filled with water lots of fish eyes here as well oh this is just this is just this is just too good that's still working I wonder if I can get into the house yep I guess it's a little bit flooded but we got a leak somewhere but the place is still here I think it's quite cool the way this I like it I like it I mean it doesn't affect anything I don't like it I now have a giant aquarium however I am technically still very well not even just technically I am very last in the build off at the moment because this thing is taller than that thing which is taller than mumbles rocket which is definitely taller than my magnet and I don't even know what to say about RAM Bob he's he's clearly he's taking off he's clearly taking off and I gotta fix that so before I can do anything I need to get rid of this rocket that I caught with the magnet and to be honest with you I was kind of hoping that mumble would have tried to launch this rocket since Oh something happened since last time when I caught it but since he hasn't and since I have a massive massive panic when it comes to flying machines I mean I yeah I don't know will this work does this do anything something oh okay I did I did something I did something is it is it flying no it's it's absolutely don't fly pretty cool that's look pretty cool another piston to push back I'm really bad with flying machines oh I made something happen it's a feels open it's at least something is happening it's tough it's not moving though I have no idea what I'm doing I think I've said this before but flying machines in Minecraft really freaks me out for some reason I just yeah I can do the very very basic one but to get this whole thing to fly is just not gonna happen so I'm just gonna illustrate that we make it take off and go straight in the direction it's pointing I guess yeah aha yes so the rocket flew I mean totally flew too bad too bad my recording software didn't record it so I decided to add some flames and smoke to the Rockets back and I decided to make greens house look a little bit more like it's actually had an impact and yeah that's that's actually looking really cool so again with the magma blocks the laser has generated magma look so magma blocks had to be there I also changed out some of the sprues if you look closely for dark oak just around the impact zone so with the rocket out of the way we have to start thinking about our magnet and our base because believe it or not after all of this I mean we're still Bristol dead last it's still dead last I've been thinking a lot about what we could actually pull down from from the sky I've received a lot of comments and suggestions and I've been thinking about Space Station satellite dishes spoons yeah spoons as in the the cutlery but I think my favorite one that I came up with was to pull down the moon yep I want to pull down the moon and I don't really know if that makes sense is the moon magnetic I mean there is some sort of gravity field then I guess this may just be a gravity magnet I I don't really know I have been over to the N dimension and I've done something super grindy which is to collect this amount of n stone and this should be just about enough to create a spherical moon on top of this magnet this is gonna be a little bit of a tricky build because once again for some weird reason I've decided to build a sphere we got a patrol spawning on glass glass making their way up to oh my goodness look at that yeah they're just they're just having a good time punch you down yep and beautiful good so in this time-lapse I thought I'd speak to you guys a little bit about another series hermit sky which is my modded single-player project also on three minecraft 1.12 point to a modded series of doom and and yet I'm totally ok to add of doom on to that series anyway a lot of people have been asking where that series is and I know a lot of people are just sitting here waiting and hoping that my next upload is gonna be a hermit sky and I keep may be disappointing a few of you with not uploading it and I don't really have a good reason why I'm not uploading that series at the moment I haven't like ended the series per se either it's been quite a while since the last episode the problem was asked many times before with me whenever a new minecraft vanilla version comes out which happens like once a year that usually kills my base motivation to play an old minecraft with mods and the second issue I have with hermit sky is just the fact that protozoan is probably I'd say top 3 laggy packs that you can ever play modded minecraft with because it has so many freaking modes that is just crazy heavy on there on the computer the pack takes 8 minutes to load so if it ever crashes that's like yeah that's game over for for that recording day but all in all I wanted to say that I I really appreciate that so many people seem to like the series and are asking for it I haven't cancelled it per se but I haven't been motivated or inspired enough to come back to it and that is you know that that's the ownest reason I I don't want to upset anyone but I also don't want to make a series where I'm not a hundred and fifty Knight two hundred and fifty percent motivated and passionate about it because I think the end product will just suffer if I do something I don't like anyway look at this it kind of looks like a cheese ball no oh but that is old under house effort I am not loving building spheres in Minecraft that being said though it looks pretty cool I think and yeah definitely it's definitely a moon or or cheese which either way is fine by me now we're definitely beating mumble now however we are still far off or went quite far off green and we are definitely far off this guy I can't want to see the while I've left on the top of this hat 219 oh my goodness and I am at 197 on top of the moon so we definitely need to play something on top of this because I don't want to be last anymore I'm sorry I know I'm not last any more at the moment but I would be first I definitely want to be first can we fit a space station up there could we could we possibly fit the tiniest moon space station in history on this base here I mean that would be a challenge and a half we would literally have to use every single spot and be very clever with buildings in order to achieve that what I'm thinking I want to try this maybe this may be one of those things that just doesn't work but if it does work I think it could be really cool so what I'm thinking here is we'll go with white concrete once again I mean this block is just this is just ridiculous ridiculously used everywhere because it's so good but we'll do something like this and this snow is gonna make me mess up and then make a massive cylinder or massive but like a cylinder coming out right there oh it looks like looks like a mouse cheese mouse I think well I think this is another or this course is probably for another time-lapse big ears yeah I'm gonna have to play around with this idea but I think I think this may work too time lapses in the same video well sometimes that's just how he goes and I gotta say this build here was incredibly difficult to try and fit on the moon I actually redid this quite a few times I logged a firma craft and tried in my creative test wall just to see what I could build with this small amount of space it is actually quite challenging which also you know in a way added a lot of fun for me I'd like being a little bit challenged sometimes in Minecraft it also had me thinking because at some points when I was testing the designs it just turned out to look like a modern plastic castle which is absolutely not what I wanted so I started thinking about I wonder what people's general like best build style favorite pill style is in this game because there are so many different ways you can build a base of whatever you build in this and so I wanted to ask a question what is your favorite type of build style in Minecraft what is the go-to for you guys for me it's probably actually still medieval I've really really enjoyed medieval so do let me know down below in the comments what your favorite builds tell is I'll be watching anyway back on the server for that small amount of space that's available on our Moon I'm pretty pleased with this thing I mean the truck is in the way yeah I'm pretty pleased with this thing I mean I'm not I'm not a fan of space stuff I don't really know anything about space stuff but I think it looks it looks it looks weird and I think that's a good thing sp12 weird I had an idea to make this even weirder first of all redstone lamps go around here secondly we need to fill this floor all the way in next I want to put slabs on top of the lamps and fully I have enough words for this then we're gonna want pressure plates on the inside of these lights so that when I step on these these light up and then to complete the build I'll bring this roof of the tower in alright that's looking good and now I need a bunch of chickens where's Paul - ma'am when one needs him don't really know how to get a lot of eggs the obvious first choice is to check every chest of greens out oh my goodness oh that's better bro man who always seems to be throwing eggs at everybody I mean he doesn't have a single egg luckily the ice queen or egg queen came to the rescue and said I can have all her eggs that I can find in the base eight sacks eight stacks of eggs that's fantastic I'm so happy I checked my inventory before flying back as well because yeah my life chart needs a little bit of repairing so now that we got eggs I should be fine just throwing them in here and I'm hoping to get at least I don't know maybe ten chickens oh it's already working yes is that gonna be enough one two three four five six a little more okay I think that's enough so when the chickens move around in here which they should be doing just randomly whenever and they should be it they should actually be be focusing on the walls just how with how minecraft mechanics work just let's move let's just make sure we light this up yeah when they do that they will randomly as you can see light up these lights which I guess in a way could illustrate that we're picking up alien signals or something like that I I don't know anything about space like I said but I think that effect is gonna be cool that the finish is up I want to add some arm blocks as the last layer and I think I want to put a beacon down here as well to signal we're signaling space or whatever and would something like this look like a raid or perhaps it spins around again I don't know about space so I don't know if they have Raiders do they have Raiders what would they have Raiders in space it's something it's something and one of these things very important as well this is a spin spinning spinner spinner right let's have a look at this thing yep that is looking pretty cool pretty cool indeed I may want to add more beacons actually I wasn't want to catch the chickens doing the dance in there there we go there we go some signals are up the best effect is when they're running around and pressing a lot of those pressure plates at one time but yet they could also just be camping out in static still like that right now for the important part we are at 224 and a half yes yes and yes we heard once again back on top it's been a long time since I was back on top and I am actually very pleased with how this little space station turned out I mean like I said it was extremely hard to build anything that resemble a space station on this small amount of space but I think I did really good I really I really really like it now I also spent a little bit of time just lighting up the windows inside the space station and yeah it doesn't really do that much but it adds a little bit of effect all in all I'm very proud of this I'm honestly very proud of this thing I may want to add some details and stuff inside but I think it looks really cool now a lot of you guys have been asking me in the comments about the minigames so we started this minigame quite a while back and I realized that in YouTube videos I haven't really paid it a lot of attention at all but in reality weeks ago I actually finished the whole thing in livestream so as you can see yeah this thing is this thing is looking incredible I think so we have the red side over there we have the yellow side over there all of the different shops oh my goodness how did they get in here I was just about to say everything is spawn proof so mobs can spawn here they may have they may have it felt like they were swarming that may have fallen down from the side because I haven't yet done that but anyway all of the shops are completely done all of the spawning rooms are completely done with functions as well so that you get your starting items all I need to do is to stock this with what well what is happening where are you guys coming from anyway as I was saying all I need to do is to stock these with the different shop items that we have decided and goodness sake since we've already come up with all of the different items that should be easy peasy and probably something I'm gonna do in a live stream in case anyone have any great last-minute suggestions so keep an eye out on my twitch channel for that and then the second thing I need to do is to sell tickets to this thing and I have been thinking a lot about this now I think that I should charge 20 diamonds per player's 20 diamonds for anyone who wants to play this game and I want to get as many Hermits involved as possible so I'm also thinking that if you win you get the diamonds back and that should be then given me some profit so if we have wait did I get that wrong if we have 10 Hermits 20 diamonds that's 200 diamonds in total and the winning team will get a hundred diamonds yeah 20 diamonds hdall so I would make a hundred diamonds profit and the winning team if if you win you have a good time and it doesn't cost you a dime I think a dime a dime and I think that's actually a good a good middle ground or a good way to do it there are a lot of functions that are fully working with this for example this floor here if you fall into it I have magma or sorry I have hope of mine cards underneath the picks up all the loot and essentially or eventually spits it out in the middle so if you die with the flag while you're carrying the flag over the flag will be spat out into the center and also all your items which means that your teammates etc can come and try and pick it up or the enemy team can try and recover the flag and steal your items so there's no way inside this arena where you can actually lose items and these things here are also working they are of course the cobblestone mines these are where where you get all your resources for the game all the currency and I decided to mark them Orange which is a little bit of a bright color choice for this but because we have yellow and red as the team's and this is sort of a neutral area I thought I thought that it's fitting so I wanted to leave you today with the request of hearing if you think that my I sing for this game is accurate and I would also like to hear if anyone has any suggestions for how we could get as many Hermes as possible in involved I'm thinking that we should open up some small shops both in the Hermit lands in in hermit ville and possibly even in people's faces add a little ticket booth thing just for sales onto them but I'm not entirely sure but anyway with that that's gonna do it for today ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for watching I hope you have enjoyed the video if you did do hit the like button and if you brand new because it is carbon and I'll see you dudes in the next episode

investigation (CBC Marketplace),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRNaqntsLPI,0,1033806,6509,499,2059,xRNaqntsLPI,"this is marketplace undercover inside Canada's Funeral Homes the top level in the bottom level they start at three thousand dollars can you trust the people meant to help you the most 98 percent is enjoy we're still grieving it's only been a couple days high-pressure sales he doesn't die in the next 90 days we set up to paying for more high cost so altogether we be looking at $12,500 marketplace and the Toronto Star investigate death incorporated but frightening here today well I love honest ed we're gathering to say goodbye to honest debt it is in a way about morning but I think it's also about celebration a celebration of life but not for a person it's for a much-loved bargain store if we can for me it's a farewell where decades have cheap deals and free Christmas turkeys are coming to an end nostalgic all the changes that be coming to this neighborhood it seems like a good place to Ted how much people think about losing something or someone but I want to throw a question at you at a left field here come a question you might find awkward what if you died today I would look after everything that needs to be done with a funeral we died yeah okay that's kind more interesting okay anything I guess it's pretty scary yes what do you want not too much I want a celebration my goodness that's a weird one I know it's a weird one I can't even give you an answer if you were to die today who would look after your funeral that's a bizarre question yeah have you ever thought of it yeah what is your frame of mind when you're walking into a to a bureau Hall are you susceptible to being taken advantage of you're probably at the most susceptible point of your life you're about to find out what happens when sales Trump sympathy let's do that do this our team is getting ready to head inside funeral homes just how upfront or staff when we need help the most we'll need a cover story well how about we have an honesty on the coolerado Aunt Alice isn't a wealthy woman she wants a simple service there I am that's great okay beautiful yeah like many Canadians Alice wants to be cremated come join us for the journey Arbor memorial is our funeral home of choice it's the largest Canadian funeral company and it's expanding but it's also one we've heard many complaints event from pressure to prepay for a funeral to a lack of empathy and preying on emotions by overcharging how bad can it be we head into six locations hi and tell the same story at each one is a non - L in our time of need will Arbor help us or add to the heartbreak honey talk about what we wanted and we needed to do this before so I need to be on kind of something very simple and information but simple isn't what they have in mind in the business of death costs can add up quickly in 1895 that's your starting point what should you spend on a casket what about this one in the middle of eleven months five two thousand eight hundred ninety five twenty five thirty three four thousand seven Oh what about embalming it costs 500 but is it required involving is a ship reserved so many decisions to make okay baby and a portrait a car so altogether we've been looking at three or twelve thousand five hundred dollars from the very and pre-planning directors like these make a base salary the rest is Commission so when it comes to planning a simple funeral it's not easy to know what you really need lucky for us aunt Alice isn't real but I'm about to meet someone whose loss is very real so was the nightmare she faced at the Arbor location in Windsor hi Judy hi I'm David hi David nice meet you Judy would wrote to marketplace wanted to share her story as a warning to others did you feel going in there that a fewer home and its staff were a place that you could trust very much we just felt they understand and we'll try to assist you getting through this difficult time and not take advantage this is a business unlike any other you're so vulnerable they have you this was a fantastic one we surprised her with a birthday Judy's sister Diana was only 56 when cancer killed her Diana had paid over $4,000 for her own funeral believing that would cover it and lessen the burden on her family it didn't Judy's left to plan the rest when you're in a funeral home how upfront were they about all of those charges they weren't they weren't at all they the gentleman had a laptop and there was a large screen and as he asked us the different questions that item went up on the list it wasn't until the very end that we saw what the cost would be for all of the things we selected and what was that number $10,000 what did you think oh we were shocked this is how much you were told it would cost our bure recommends a package arranging an administration is 1755 what that includes I'm not quite sure making sense of that package seems next to impossible that doesn't include the cost of the vehicle the transfer to the funeral home that's for the doesn't include the cost of actually getting to the funeral home I don't sandesh to reduce the price Judy gets rid of some services but it wasn't easy I didn't want to seem like I was asking a lot of questions about money it's like while you pay what you have to pay right we're at the same location judy turn to for help we have an on too much very well okay cremation we just want something nice and simple at first there's sympathy but she quickly gets down to business like Judy were offered a package and told identifying Aunt Alice is company policy Sally would have to identify her for sure to make sure that we have the right person that's our this planner should just embalming I mean it has been bombing for that but there is no law requiring embalming and in a lot of cases no need to avoid passing on any diseases and although we don't want a viewing for our fictional aunt so why all this well it's part of the package she's recommended she did better clerk closure whether the cast is open or not by doing it this way better closure Arbor makes judy identify her sister which means extra costs for things she never wanted he's very kind saying you know take your time go in there's like no we're not going to take our time we're only here to identify her and yet she was laid out and presented as if she was going to be viewed and you were paying for that and we were paying for that even though that's not something you wanted that's not what we wanted and that's not what she wanted did you want him bombing not that worked if it wasn't needed and what happened she was involved more well because she was going to be dressed and displayed for you to identify her we're shaking our heads like why are we doing this let's just go with it like is to do that let's do that but he's the guy I mean how many times have you been finished before that never so what happened it was terrible somebody had dressed her and put makeup on her and put her in her clothes again and it didn't look like her it was in my heart it wasn't her but it was something we were forced to do so that we felt I felt bitter it wasn't just that there was expense that no you feel is unnecessary no it's that your closure was reopened yes we had said our goodbyes in the hospital we weren't given any option and that's wrong more than 250,000 canadians died last year including Judy's sister in the business of death that amounts to a 1.6 billion dollar industry big players like Arbor make the majority of the profits and with our aging population stand to make even more I'm in Manitoba to meet a guy who's in no wall and now a towel all right Shane David good to meet you nice to meet you thank you very much Shane Neufeld worked in the business for 25 years at times for the big guys including Arbor he knows the secrets of the south I mean economical and doesn't like what he hears about our Alice's service right there what she's doing is increasing the value of that sale with that family it was all about identification it wasn't about of viewing well they're using identification as a means to an end the end is to get the money for the embalming because in Bombay is expensive that doesn't cost much but most of us aren't professionals at burying our loved ones the consumer is at an extreme disadvantage you can't possibly come out on the right side of that if you're in front of people who are motivated to sell you things that you don't need we dig up our bure job postings some traits they value most include a sales mentality people who are skillful at negotiating and closing who meet and exceed sales quota goals and here's what that looks like in action remember we only want a simple service information a small celebration but they're pushing packages that same day service costs almost sixty four hundred dollars do we need everything on that so our United is present 98% mandatory and there's no mention of an a la carte option I'd like to see that package 98% it seems like a very high number it's only when we press that Arbor agrees to get rid of a few items about $600 worth flowers vehicle yes they're out of the car business this is your time a not yet serious all of us will be okay the flower vehicle for a simple service we haven't even talked price for the actual formation imagine if we were racked with guilt and grief so what's really necessary for Aunt Alice Shane takes a look and says many items can go worse he says it seems arbors double charging for staff he figures the package could be cut by almost two thousand dollars well in that case our hidden camera team is being live with how to pay so how much should the casket cost you eight hundred and ninety five dollars so we managed to get the wholesale cost for that any idea what it is one hundred and seventy-five dollars closing the deal on your marketplace the big business of dying we're undercover Six Feet Under shopping for a simple funeral the top level in the bottom level they started three thousand dollars to normalize is on thousand three hundred and ninety five dollars simple answers are proving hard to find and I am come on to that that really has I will find from outfit as sad as funerals are they're also a business cackling this piece we have for 3842 our doors and the staff who help you plan are working on Commission money means a lot when beginning all the activist ask who's going to be a table times this planner encourages walking in before losing out just pay the price goes up in a year and it's a longer journey and with hefty prices you might easily be convinced our industry insider used to do it that way too but guilt got the better of them now Shane Neufeld calls himself a death care consultant thanks so much got a piece tree he believes you should be charged a flat fee about giving people the truth and products and costs and the rest of the industry the big guys their role is to make as much money as they can which is fine it's just not something I want to do and something he says he wouldn't do push a package like this with Transfer Vehicle drivers a funeral coach Alexis Union coach to the funeral coach brings her to the in the casket to the crematorium that's on the same site that she doesn't matter how far they still have to use the vehicle but do they need to charge almost 350 dollars for that vehicle so Brett the funeral home let's go and see how far away try3 friends are in the drive takes one minute this is the criminal a.m. right now right behind the Muslim so we have driven 400 meters of the dollar amita for auntie alice mostly machine room here will be three to four thousand dollars another questionable cost rental caskets to view and alice who remember will be cremated I wish more suggesting from an economical standpoint a rental plastic sounds hopeful five the residence is over 250 for one day yes your brain casket inside the counter your rental Michele and you're pretty thing another casket is like we get our hands on a wholesale price lamp not casting it costs Arbor 1695 500 less and they can use it time and again seems like a sweet deal for them it's not a cost savings for us this is what they use for just cremation and they don't want anything and it has no lines on it we try saving money at another location all of this would go with her that's all part of all that yeah once we'll give her I hope we can see what's below that casket it's tilted toward you that makes it much more desirable to purchase and then you have this down below underneath the other casket that is strategically placed but they don't want us to have it that's not a visitation tech this humane district summation what's the big deal just sometimes though I like this one why can I leave let me ask the manager husband said with more than a thousand dollars on the line they dig in their heels she just want something very simple an identification container so yeah you wouldn't really see that during visitation was almost taken aback at the suggestion that yeah that she wants something simple and that's a way of making people feel minimized and feel badly for wanting something simple I mean they're being careful but they're not being forthright so much to watch out for and even with time on our side it's not easy when the cell kicks in when you for me right well this planner starts out wanting a deposit of four grand you want to get the people are in place small class sizes but really he'll take anything to close the deal and get the Commission on your knowledge from the cemetery not $100 over game yourself independence he continues to push here taken we allow people upper need a cancellation clause it just takes that pressure off in that time she's already answered the question no we don't think we want to do that right now the ideas walk the business down now while they're inside lock it in Judy would sister thought she'd locked it in but Judy still had to pick up the pieces what would you say to harbor you need to be more upfront you know people need to understand that people are hurting they're coming in here relying on you depending on you to not take advantage and I think we were taken advantage of so who's watching out for us is there enough for you to follow up with our that's what this is your market life this is your market life our journey inside the business of death reveals a world of high pressure and high cost that's good work looks interesting where the upsell can add to your grief mission prepare know who's meant to protect us the bereavement Authority of Ontario is one of the few provincial regulators it investigates complaints keeps tabs on the industry but regulations don't cover the kind of hard sell we're seeing good to meet you at me GT the Registrar is Carrie Smith oh this is 98% percent or he doesn't like some of what he sees well you're the consumer you were having the ability to pick and choose but he he's saying to us that 98% of what's on there we got to take there's things on here that the legislation certainly doesn't make mandatory should you be told but you can buy things individually and not in the package yes you should be but with only three inspectors for more than 600 funeral homes tactics like this go unchecked we zero in on that home that doesn't want us buying a cheaper casket so they're following the law but they're trying to dissuade us from using the less expensive options certainly trying to dissuade you from using it I just don't understand it after we've seen all this video any concerns around pre-planning salespeople well you've showed me a bunch of examples that certainly our minimum disappointing and would cause me to you know have concerns and that we'll have to look into we went to six locations all six are from Arbor Funeral Homes big player in the industry I would be surprised if that's their corporate values and philosophy they're their professional provider is there enough for you to follow up with over absolutely we do follow up with every salesperson we met they all say call head office let's despite weeks of discussions with Arbor Memorial they say no to an on-camera interview we're questioning their right to make money but we do have questions about their sales practices and their response comes in the form of a statement we are confident that our business practices are fair and they don't condone behavior that may cause customers to feel pressure but to avoid heartache shop around ask what's not included and talk about it have you told your kids exactly what you want no you know and as it almost seems my cause when you do it"

Human beings are capable of building incredible structures, from the latest cutting-edge office blocks to artistic sculptures. Cathedrals, sporting arenas, and monuments all over the world are a testament to our creative skill as a species. In the modern era though, we have technology to help us, from huge mechanical drills to laser cutting curved glass. Builders didn’t have these luxuries in ancient times, so how did they manage to create some of the ancient wonders we’re about to show you in this video? Science still doesn’t have the answers.  

For all questions contact us at: amazingstockchannel@gmail.com",Oldest Technologies Scientists Still Can't Explain,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeajYcltm5c,0,3235495,21217,3726,3836,QeajYcltm5c,"human beings are capable of building incredible structures from the latest cutting edge office blocks to artistic sculptures Cathedral sporting arenas and monuments all over the world are a testament to our creative skill as a species in the modern era though we have technology to help us from huge mechanical drills to laser cutting curved glass builders didn't have these luxuries in ancient times so how did they manage to create some of the ancient wonders we are about to show you in this video science still doesn't have the answers asuka in Japan is where we start our journey with these huge megalithic stone structures which have stood in place for centuries they were clearly carved and arranged in their current formation for a specific purpose but nobody knows what that purpose is there is speculation that they may have been sacrificial altars or platforms upon which people watched and worshipped the Stars but they're just guesses most impressive of all of them is Sokka funa Ishii which is covered in complicated tracks and engravings also worthy of note is Massoud o yo foon a which is 36 feet long and nearly 16 feet high and seems to have been carved out of a lump of pure granite the granite is so thick that even modern technology would struggle to scratch the surface so how is it carved and shaped 2500 years ago even more mysterious is the II show NoHo Den which is attached to a boulder around 60 miles from the rest of the structures weighing around 600 tons in standing 23 feet high it looks like it was abandoned before it was finished but it's been precisely cut down one side to give it its strange appearance whoever built it moved 600 tons of rock and carved it into shape without leaving a trace of a chisel or pickaxe on the surface the temples of shravanabelagola in India are equally perplexing to scientists they are more than a thousand years old and have perfectly carved columns all of which are intricately detailed and display absolute symmetry such work might be possible today with skilled artisans using lathes and chisels but the workers of the time had no such instruments these columns are beautiful polished and patterned to the point where visiting tourists can't help but touch them when they pay a visit did we know more about stonework a thousand years ago than we do today did we lose a secret civilization of master craftsmen without a trace centuries ago who could have constructed these temples and how did they do the work we still don't have complete scientific agreement on how the ancient Egyptians built the pyramids but a recent discovery nearby them is even harder to understand archaeologists have found 24 black boxes all of which are carved from solid as one granite and weigh more than 100 tons buried inside a system of caves inside a hill the carving has been performed with such skill and accuracy that it would be considered a phenomenal achievement in the 21st century but these boxes were crafted 3,300 years ago they are now known as the Serapeum of Saqqara which implies that they are part of a temple to the egyptian god Serapis but that's guesswork it might have taken the work of a God to create the boxes because science doesn't have any better answers out in the Ural Mountains researchers have found a series of objects so out of place and bizarre that they've been forced to consider the possibility that they came from a crashed alien spaceship they were first found in the banks of rivers near the mountains in 1991 and they take the form of minuscule coils the kind you might find in an engine or a modern piece of machinery the problem is that they couldn't have been used in such a way because they're three hundred thousand years old along with the coils are what appear to be engine shafts the Russian Academy of Sciences has analysed the artifacts and concluded that they're composed of copper and tungsten and range in size from a little over an inch to one ten thousandth of an inch that's small enough for them to be considered nanotechnology by modern standards the objects were buried 40 feet below the surface of the river with the geology of the rocks around them confirming their age so they weren't put there recently the combined efforts of specialists facilities in Helsinki Moscow and st. Petersburg have been unable to confirm how they could have been created or by who that leaves us with aliens or time travelers as prime suspects things are supposed to get bigger and better with technology so you probably expect that the record for largest granite block ever carved by humans to be broken every year in reality that record belongs to each giant monolith in Baalbek Lebanon and has stood for somewhere between nine and twelve thousand years the rock forms part of the temple of Jupiter and some feel that it was the work of the Romans but historian Graham Hancock disagrees he feels the stones are the work of a lost civilization and the Romans simply built the temple on top of them weighing over 1,000 tons each it's impossible to imagine how any civilization of that era could have accurately cut them and then moved them into place a rejected stone that was left back at the nearby quarry after being cut is even larger than the ones used in the foundation with a total weight of 1,650 tons another stone in nygma can be found just outside Cusco Peru which is home to the walls of szyskii woman the huge walls are made of dry stone and precisely cut so they fit together with no adhesive each stone weighs anything up to 150 tons and the construction of the walls is unlike anything else in either North or South America so tight are the patterns that not even a single sheet of paper can be passed between or beneath the stones the fact that they have rounded corners and the precise nature of the way they lean inward are evidence of advanced building skills the best theory science can offer is that the ancient Incas put the stones together based on guesswork and chipped away with them at stone hammers until they fit raising and lowering them from the walls many times in the process that seems both unlikely and impractical there are even records of native Incans telling their Spanish conquerors that the walls predated their civilization and they did not know how they were created when scientists suggested that liquid SAP from plants could have been used to soften the stones but that wouldn't explain how they were later hardened again so we have to consider that half an idea at best to make a map you need knowledge of an area to make a map with an aerial perspective you need to be looking down from above that's easy now with planes drones and helicopters if the dashka stone is to be taken at face value it would seem that someone or something was capable of making such a map 120 million years ago when dinosaurs ruled the earth that's why some call it the map of the Creator and consider it a blueprint used by the creator of our planet it was discovered in 1999 and appears to represent a perfect map of not just the Ural Mountains but 7500 miles of land around it including channels rivers and dams there are also hieroglyphs on the stone which defy translation weighing one tonne the map is not only accurate in two dimensions but three with the surface of the stone rising and falling just as the land does adding to the idea that the stone was crafted by hand it's constructed in three layers seven inches of cement on dolomite an inch of silicon enriched glass and 0.1 inch of calcium on top which makes it easier to read the age of 120 million years comes from shale fossils found within the rock but even if they'd got there by accident the tablet would still have to be at least 3,000 years old at a minimum scientists have suggested that the fissures on the rock have happened by accident and their resemblance to the Urals is a coincidence we don't think anybody believes them returning to Peru we find more evidence of the ingenuity of the Incas or possibly the lost civilization that came before them the more Rey ruins are a series of concentric circles in the mountains close to Cusco all leading down to a central recess pit testing that's been carried out on the circles reveals a strange phenomenon the temperature of the Rings can vary by up to 15 degrees from the warmest to the coldest that makes some people believe that the rings were cut for agricultural purposes and enabled the Incas to grow different crops at different points within the circles keeping themselves fed all year long that would require a far greater knowledge of both science and engineering than we currently credit them with could this be something else science has got wrong they don't seem to be in any hurry to tell us and they don't have any better ideas either Ethiopian Christians looking for evidence of God will point you in the direction of the 11 churches of lalibela which are carved into the mountains of the country and are each formed from one singular block of granite modern-day experts believe that even creating one such church would take a workforce of forty thousand people several years but the Ethiopians insist they were carved by angels overnight an element of the supernatural would certainly explain how windows doors and tunnels were carved so intricately on and through the churches the work has been done in a manner which allows light to filter in through the roofs but also drains away water to prevent water damage the amount of planning involved in labor like this is almost incalculable but for an architect of the 12th century to be able to plan this is inconceivable no tools known to be available at the time would have been capable of the job either this is yet another baffling set of buildings created by unknown hands and unknown skills rumors of ancient human made caves in long yo China had persisted for centuries being passed down from generation to generation until one man named Wu and I decided to put the rumors to the test in 1992 he bought a mechanical water pump and drained the pond in the local village expecting to find nothing instead he found out that what everyone thought was a pond was just one of 24 vast secret caves that had been hiding below long Yao since at least 2,500 years ago the caves are more like caverns 100 feet deep and covered in hand-carved lines and symbols which nobody has been able to translate no known historical text contains any record of their construction or any note of what they were used for there's evidence of chisel work around the finer points of the carvings but if chisels were used to create the caves then thousands of people must have been involved why has nobody ever made a note of them who could have done this in the days before the Ching dynasty of all the ancient cities in the world that are still standing only one was ever built on a coral reef and that's nan Madol in Micronesia the intelligent design features stone and coral construction work on platforms which sit on artificial islands all connected by water channels and defended by an outer sea wall it would be a cutting edge design for a city of the future but it's from the distant past we don't know quite when in the past it may have happened though estimates range from the Year 500 to 1100 non-model is so mysterious that no record exists of how when or why it was built for by who building a city on top of coral reef wasn't an easy or logical process so it must have had some kind of special meaning but it's been lost a time there's also no native stone nearby to assist with the construction so it must have been brought in from elsewhere and maneuvered into place without any levers pulleys or metal tools with the rocks weighing as much as 50 tons each how could that have been possible at the time you guessed it science doesn't know over in Laos we have the Plain of Jars fields of huge stone jar shapes scattered across the land across the northern mountains of the country they were first discovered during the 1930s but they date back to the iron age making them more than two thousand years old there are over three thousand jars in total each weighing well over a ton and standing up to ten feet high the presence of lip rims suggested they once had lids which have since rotted away the legend that local people tell about them is that giants once lived upon this land and used the jars to store their rice wine scientists do believe they might have an idea of the right answer this time though they believe the jars were used as part of funeral ceremonies even if that's correct they still can't give a satisfactory answer as to how the people of 500 BC would be able to create them in the first place South America is rich with ruins and ancient curiosities but the most staggering of them all is to be found in Bolivia's Pumapunku near Tiahuanaco it's a site that predates even the Incas the Incas loved it after they arrived here though they believed that it was so beautiful that puma punku was the place where all human life was created and then sent out into the world it's easy to see why the perfectly carved and intersecting stones and bricks are works of precision but have no chisel marks or other indications of human carving what human hands could have worked so delicately without leaving a trace of the labor the temples feature irrigation systems to deal with a runoff of rainwater and bore holes in the rock that are so smooth they appear to have been drilled but such feats were way beyond the capabilities of what we know of humankind when the site was built 3,000 years ago even after all these years it is impossible even to drive the point of a needle between the perfectly secured stones you can't even say that of most structures built in a present day who lived before the Incas and had such mastery of masonry we're still looking for answers subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications and you will be the first to know when a new video comes out thank you for

We visit NASA to learn about all the essentials of extravehicular space wear, all the way down to the emergency diapers.",How Astronauts Put on Space Suits,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsdoJy8rzZg,0,1567404,10502,421,947,VsdoJy8rzZg,"it's Norm from Tested calm and I'm here
 at the neutral buoyancy lab NASA's neutral buoyancy lab in Houston Texas
 this is where NASA trains astronauts before they can go to space and hero
 Terry done you're the training Operations Manager and Terry we're in
 front of a spacesuit right this is the extra vehicular Mobility unit or EMU as
 we call it and it's the spacesuits that astronauts wear for spacewalks either
 the Space Shuttle back in those days or the space station now and so this is the
 news this is the design that's been used for decades right it's essentially
 unchanged for the past 40 years now we've seen what the spacesuit kind of
 looks like you know in photos and videos but we don't really know what goes
 underneath and how an astronaut she puts on the suit can you show us the
 different components of a spacesuit and all the various different accessories
 that they put on well sure this is really just the outer
 layer and it starts with a few things that we have over here now on this table
 we have the components to go inside of the suit starting with the diaper
 underwear in space oh but it's a diaper right and it's big enough for an adult
 but it's the same purpose and ideally you're not going to have to use it but
 in reality you're going to be in that suit about six hours so and this is only
 worn when you're in going to wear a spacesuit right and now when you're just
 flown around the ISS up to that right personal preference I suppose but when
 you got to go you got to go no over the diaper you're going to have basically
 off-the-shelf cotton long johns alright so mine is fine right and the
 idea is that it's going to wick away any sweat that you have in there so that
 your body doesn't get slippery and you're not going to puddle sweat at the
 bottom of the suit so you would have the pants and then also a long-sleeve shirt
 that would go over that sounds good sounds like everything I could buy at a
 supermarket right now right so far you're good be happy you're ready to go
 into space next you're going to get derailed a little bit this is the liquid
 cooled ventilation garment and basically it's a jumpsuit with very stretchy
 material but woven in through that material are tubes
 on cold water so by varying the flow rate of that cold water you can manage
 your body temperature you can imagine with all this stuff underneath and then
 all the stuff you're going to put on the outside you get hot very quickly
 especially if you're working outside and so it's just through these tubes here
 and and it's designed so those are the points where heat can be can be release
 more effectively right it's distributed well enough that you don't feel point
 cooling it's it's basically an overall effect okay and then we've got the
 communication cap and this is really kind of a NASA trademark this is the
 Snoopy cap that ya read about forever and OH so if you'd like you may try it on I
 will Wow all right so this plugs in Vani this will plug into a port on the suit
 and then you've got electrical power and there's a radio built in that lets you
 talk to the guys back inside the space station and indirectly back down to
 Mission Control we would also have a few other ancillary items that are kind of
 at the discretion of the astronaut they'll be wearing cotton gloves that go
 underneath the regular gloves and again it's the same idea is the undergarments
 you're just going to want to wick away the sweat underneath and then we also
 have a variety of pads and shields that help limit any contact with the metal
 inside the suit so you don't get soft spots and bruising while you're in there
 this would be an example of those all right and then after they put all this
 on they put on the EMU right the outer part of the suit all right let's go
 check that out since we're here at the NBL these suits are used for training
 purposes how does this suit differ than what the astronauts actually wear ISS
 well if you take away the life-support system which is the backpack looking
 thing appear there's really no difference in fact a lot of the hardware
 that we use here for training is hardware that's flown in space before
 been in space and repurposed as training right I like to think it's been upgraded
 for training but they call it downgrading for training an astronaut
 would have to disassemble it from it hanging on a wall for putting it on
 right they would want to break it down into the same components like we have
 here and what do they put on first um the first thing you're going to do is
 put on the lower torso assembly which to you and me would be a pair of pants with
 the shoes built in they call it space walking but you don't use your legs a
 whole lot of space working so they would put this on and it gets pulled out to
 about their waist once they've got that they're going to waddle underneath this
 like in space it's not waddling going to float underneath here and then
 squat through the bottom of this upper torso assembly which is rigidly mounted
 to the inside of the space station and then get their arms up through here and
 their head will pop out of the top and then at that point they're in the suit
 and this is a very rigid suit like a does not lie mobility in here right the
 upper part that they're called the heart upper torso for a reason it's really a
 hard shell and despite the obvious comfort level of that there's a reason
 for it and you've got to have all these different things a life support system
 the controls for the suit your tools all have to be rigidly mounted so you need
 that hard shell to be able to do that what are the materials that are used for
 the EMU it's many different materials and layers I imagine right there's a few
 different composites that I can't explain all the details of a secret
 right the different composites that make up the hard upper part and then several
 layers of materials that make up the bladder part as well so they have the
 upper unit and then what's next they're going to button these two pieces
 together and they'll have an assistant that helps them do that the bottom part
 is attached to the upper part here and then they'll put on gloves and I've got
 one here if you'd like to try that uh no yeah there's lace right handed it's a
 very very tight fit there and the gloves are the customized some extent a to a
 degree um these components the lower torso or
 something the harder part or so you really get small medium and large and
 you get the best fit within that for the gloves we've got dozens of different
 sizes so while we don't necessarily make custom gloves for every person there's a
 variation that we get pretty close with just about everybody yeah and what's
 important feature of the glove you know in terms of usability functionality and
 safety there's a fine line between the dexterity that they have to be able to
 do a job and the comfort of the fit so my opinion and I'm sure a lot of people
 would disagree is that a little bit of pain is just right that means you're
 getting the best dexterity you can out of that glove if it's too comfortable
 you're probably missing a little bit of the nuance of being able to work so if
 you're to get it sort of screw a hundred times right you don't want the glove in
 your way and then both gloves on and finally the helmet then right then the
 helmet all right oh it's very echoing here
 right now when you're really in the suit you've got the air flowing through
 you're probably not going to notice that you've got a lot of materials in there
 that would damp that sound and with the helmet on the helmet hasn't turned when
 vastra nods head turns that's right your field of view is very limited so is your
 situational awareness and so you can basically look almost all the way to
 your right and left and then you need to look people look down as well correct so
 if you need to see beyond those views you're turning your whole torso like
 you're in traction to be able to do that now you're right here there's a knob
 twist that forward and that's the visor right there's also one by your left ear that would be more of a shield to keep
 direct Sun away from you and when you're in space you don't have the atmosphere
 kind of filtering out the light the sunlight is very bright and what
 material is this visor made out no that's just regular probably carbonate
 looks and plastic very very cool well that's the anatomy of a spacesuit
 attached to the spacesuit is life support unit and different tools then
 right on the back would be the life support system and on the front would be
 the tools that they use and that's all stored in another lab all right well
 let's go check those out as well all right okay Terry so these are the astronauts
 tools it's a small selection they have available yes this is what they would
 use and this what is this device here this is called the mini workstation and
 this part would attach directly to that hard upper torso that we were looking at
 and plug right in right and you can think of this as their tool belt
 most of the stuff they'll use on any given spacewalk they would try to store
 it on here to keep it handy and they could choose from a different selection
 of tools on the space station before they go on the spacewalk right they
 would decide based on whatever tasks they're going to do that time so give me
 example of some of the tools they use what we have here is a basic ratchet
 wrench and it's a lot like the ratchet wrench you would use at home it's a 3 H
 Drive and the main difference is being you've got a big wheel in the back so if
 you're going to be in a tight space operating this you don't want to have to
 reach down and turn the socket like you would at home you can get that glove and
 put it on the background turn it that way
 and also you've got a nice big handle down here that gives you plenty of
 gripping strength and it's ridged now another feature is they have a
 cheater bar they can flip this into the bottom you've got the same sort of
 handle down here but now you've pretty much doubled your moment arm so you can
 really put a lot of torque on in something and at this point you have to
 be careful that you're not going to break either the bolt or the head of the
 socket wrench and so just turn the socket in space it's different than
 doing it on earth the socket is turning you as much as you return the socket so
 a lot of times it's going to be a one-handed operation where you're going
 to use one hand to stabilize yourself while the other hand does the work or
 you have the option of using a foot restraint that would hold you in place
 do all these tools help me tethered to the astronaut at all times or it's okay
 for them to happen for hand no they never want to have it just relying on
 their grip to keep it there so we have these equipment tethers if they're doing
 a job correctly any tool that they're using is always going to be attached to
 one of these others and then they wanted to change out a head or a different
 socket then they go this side right they have a number of different sockets that
 could choose from again depending on what they want to do and there would be
 stored on something like this we call a socket caddy and so you have a pin you
 would insert it into this hole in the socket and so now both of these are
 tethered move it over to the wrench and your
 seizure right so at no point was that socket free to float away there you go
 that's the astronauts tool belt their extended daily carry if you will when
 they're out outside the space station right and then all this plus the EMU is
 how they survive and operate and work when they're in space very cool thank
 you so much Terry we'll have more from NASA and Johnson Space Center and the
 NBL on test comm I'm norm CX I'm right he did including video video game you"
moonlanding,"This film brings together the mythic and the scientific to show that Mars may now be what we imagine. Some believe Mars is the next home for Humanity. But the real “red planet” is a trickster; strikingly beautiful, yet sweetly sinister.  Even as a growing armada of instruments arrive, this small cold world continues to conceal its secrets. The technological means to cross space and perhaps bring this small world back to life is just now coming within our grasp. Settlers beware: Mars is likely to change Humanity as much as we change it.

looking landscape rich with resources some believe Mars is the next home for Humanity a frontier of freedom and prosperity and a backup copy of civilization in case of disaster here on earth but the real Red Planet is a trickster with a long history of fooling us once thought a mythic place of exotic intelligent creatures the true Mars is a failing world much colder than Antarctica bone-dry with a harsh toxic landscape we may soon have the means to get there but will we live there for thousands of years Mars has been trying to tell us something Earth and Mars come closest together every 780 days or so called a planetary opposition it's the best time to observe the Red Planet which appears to slow down backtrack then speed forward again puzzled by this capricious motion Egyptians skywatchers personified members as a hawk headed human rated deity flying back and forth between the realms of the living and the dead Babylonian astrologers believe Mars to be a quick impulsive volatile God observing the moon pass in front of the Red Planet Aristotle deduces that Mars must be higher up and farther away than the moon but he would have been surprised by how much Mars is about two hundred times more distant chemical rockets that take around three days to get to the moon would take nearly seven months to reach Mars future nuclear thermal rockets could cut that to less than three months but even that is a very long time to spend confined in a spacecraft far from Earth even with comfort foods along and you can't just return home in a few hours if there's a problem

Ptolemy proposes that martyrs and the other four wandering stars must circle earth on a set of spheres around 850 ad Islamic astronomers begin to find problems with Ptolemies epicycles but it will take another seven centuries for the truth to surface in Europe in 1543 Copernicus of Poland finally puts the Sun at the centre of motion now Mars looping behavior makes sense wealthy obsessive Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe he likes Copernicus geometry but can't quite let go of tunnel Tycho insists the mass of Earth is too lazy to orbit but massive world's do move in the early solar system Jupiter may have moved toward the Sun as far as Mars present-day orbit gobbling much of the inner solar nebulas dust and gas robbing Mars of its potential the stunted planet could grow to only about half Earth's diameter and barely 11% its mess Tycho is a compulsive data taker but it will fall to his research assistant Johannes Kepler to make sense of Tycho's numbers Kepler bets a friend he can plot Mars orbit in one week after five years and forty attempts he finds that all planetary orbits are elliptical putting the last nail in the coffin of Ptolemies crystal spheres within spheres as the early solar system evolves Jupiter and Saturn displaced billions of tons of icy rocks flinging them inward a deluge of debris lasting three million years the late heavy bombardment today the high country of Mars southern hemisphere has one very large hole punched in it the helis basin the third largest impact crater in the solar system its floor lies ten kilometers below the heights of a nearby south polar cap but Mars may have been hit by something even bigger near its opposite Pole as you fly from south to north the height of the landscape sinks seen here going from red and orange highlands down to green and blue valleys Mars whole northern hemisphere is a sunken ellipse draping over 40% of the planet if this is an impact site the incoming object would have been about the size of dwarf planet Pluto it would have totally remade Mars possibly shutting off its internal dynamo erasing its protective magnetic field and killing the chances for a life-sustaining atmosphere Galileo Galilei makes the first telescopic observation of Mars he says he's afraid it isn't round Francesco Fontana creates the first known drawing of the planet saying it looks like a very black pill probably due to flawed lenses in his spyglass the Dutch brothers Chris John and Constantin Huygens are innovating better optics Christian sketches an irregular mark on martyrs living in the wetlands of Holland he thinks it looks like a big balk so it becomes known as the Great Marsh syrtis major Huygens uses that shape to measure Mars day length finding it to be about the same as earth's giovanni domenico cassini refines that figure to 24 hours plus 40 minutes very close to what astronomers measure today he also logs the first observation of Mars south polar cap drawn here by his friend Huygens Cassini imagines that Mars is similar to earth three billion years ago Mars may indeed have been earth-like volcanoes building the atmosphere steam and mist and flowing water filling early oceans with more fluid than the Arctic Ocean on earth the first Mars rover little Sojourner the Pathfinder lands in the outflow of what must have been cataclysmic flood the Mars exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity find stacked strata of rock laid down by flowing water over thousands of years and little rounded iron-rich concretions nicknamed blueberries that formed in cavities of silt

to raise money for making life multiplanetary though christiaan huygens has died his final book cosmos the arrows will excite future generations Huygens argues that the moon and planets Harbor intelligent beings but do the other planetary worlds of our solar system truly have what it takes to be habitable the moon is rich in aluminum titanium silicon and magnesium asteroids add carbon cobalt platinum molybdenum nickel and other elements Mars has all of these plus abundant iron and many other metals especially near its enormous volcanoes but the key is water it can be split to make breathable oxygen and hydrogen fuel the Mars 2020 Rover will test this idea it'll breathe in carbon dioxide and electro chemically break out oxygen to see if rocket propellant and life support can be made on Mars water from beneath the surface and carbon dioxide from its atmosphere can be rearranged to make methane and oxygen burn the methane using that oxygen and you can launch rockets make that propellant on Mars and you can drop the cost of getting back to Earth by a factor of at least five exactly what SpaceX has committed itself to do to conjure up space-based civilization launched only what you need to live off the land tools and talent and factories and power generators if everything for space has to be built in pieces on earth then trucked up from the bottom of our deep gravity well and tediously fit together on orbit we'll never get anywhere Giacomo Filippo morality guesses that dark rings around Mars poles might be melted material could the poles be ice caps 80 years later Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel declares yes Mars poles are water ice and he thinks the broad dark equatorial patches are oceans the large syrtis major feature has come to be called the hourglass see Herschel and his contemporaries dream of what it might be like to sail these waters Mars may have lost its oceans long before life on earth emerged the northern desert lowlands the flattest terrain on any planet or moon look like the floor of an ancient sea up to four kilometers deep Mars polar ocean may have covered 1/3 of the planet in 1785 Herschel speculates that Martians probably enjoy a situation similar to our own but he reports Mars atmosphere must be very thin it is thin the planet is enveloped in sparse carbon dioxide there's very little water in the air but there's plenty not far under the crust Mars also makes tiny amounts of methane which could be coming from hot geology but those methane levels seem to bloom in certain seasons and that has a lot of experts wondering might there be life below the surface Johann hieronymus shredder believes Mars has no solid surface at all just drifting clouds and Misty Rain he thinks he sees sweeping atmospheric changes right before his eyes Schroders shifting scene probably is due to an atmosphere but it's the unstable air of Earth above his telescope that has spoiled his seeing the true story of Mars atmosphere is becoming clearer go back at least a billion years intense ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and the sputtering solar wind are bombarding the small planet with its low gravity and frail global magnetic field Mars can't hold on to its protective gas envelope most of its air and much of its water are lost to space back in 1830 however none of this tragic history is yet known Johann Heinrich modeler and vilhelm beard make the first truly accurate Mars maps they placed their longitude zero line through a feature that will later be named sinus Meridiani Meridian Bay the Mars rover Opportunity is working there right now in images Mars looks like a picturesque desert it's easy to imagine yourself standing there gazing at the intricately weathered rocks nearly everywhere you look you see evidence of past liquid water though there are no oceans today there's plenty of ice the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter records eroded cliff faces exposing compacted water ice in some places more than 100 meters thick on passes over the poles Amaro's radar reveals up to two kilometers of ice it seems to have been laid down in layers does Mars climate cycle between warm and cool orbiting spacecraft have watched dark streaks appear over time usually on the steeper slopes of craters they look just like desert gullies on earth the markings change with Mars seasons many researchers thought they might be flowing salty water new analysis suggests at least the larger ones are dry streams of rounded sand grains tumbling over one another flowing like liquid in the low gravity of Mars but the small ones seem truly wet another slippery Mars paradox astronomer Camille Flammarion picks up the intelligent alien torch and runs with it eventually publishing eight books on the topic the plurality of inhabited worlds becomes an all-time bestseller with the publication of Charles Darwin's origin of the species from a tree all has realized that differing conditions on various planets should cause creatures on them to be unlike those of Earth the building blocks of life are in fact plentiful on Mars curiosity has found abundant oxygen carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur as well as complex organic macromolecules clay minerals would have filtered salts and harsh compounds from the primeval flowing waters many microbes now living on earth would likely have survived on early Mars but no photos fossils or chemical evidence of life as yet turned up the Vatican becomes concerned about the state of grace of the marshal's father Pietro Angelo secchi of the Roman College Observatory starts to charge where they might live it gives the hourglass sea a new name calling it the atlantic canal that word simply means channel say Qi intends no reference to intelligent design but his turn can a delay will cause much confusion in the coming decades over in England astronomer William Dawes is making Mars maps of his own he's extremely nearsighted but his charts are more detailed than any made before smelling a great story science writer Richard Anthony Procter blasts the Dawes maps out to the public the Suez Canal is completed in November of 1869 making news around the world the Panama Canal is being planned many people make a connection between the straight canal e on Mars Maps and these great works of engineering on earth there are in fact many ancient water channels all over Mars but there's no evidence of technology in their shapes Mars comes once more into opposition but this time many new telescopes are pointed at it one belongs to Nathaniel Greene on the island of Madeira an artist by day an astronomer by night Greene paints the most accurate Mars chart yet over in America the self-taught astronomer Asaph Hall sees something no one else has two tiny movements fobos and damos may be bits of Mars flung into orbit by giant impacts long ago or they may be asteroids captured by the planets gravity as Mars comes close within 56 million kilometers of Earth Giovanni Schiaparelli is ready though he like Dawes is nearsighted and colorblind chaparral II is able to extract more from the telescope than others heetu calls the lines he sees on Mars Canali and he gives them whimsical names from classical literature like Pyrrhus Cerberus and piri Phlegethon labels still used by Mars mappers today why are some Mars opposition's closer than others while Earth's orbit around the Sun is nearly circular Mars orbit is much more elliptical only Mercury's is more eccentric during Mars southern ottoman winter that hemisphere is tipped away from the Sun and the whole planet is farther away making those seasons longer and colder another close opposition and Schiaparelli comes to believe he's seen pairs of straight Canali Harvard College Observatory director William Henry Pickering declares the canals of Mars are only rendered visible by plants growing along their banks and the surrounding lap any science-based speculation about large engineering projects by smart Martians will die abruptly on the night of July 14th 1965 as NASA's Mariner 4 flies by Mars in the probes 21 images Mars looks much more like the moon than the earth and worse Mariner can't find a protective magnetic field harsh solar wind and cosmic radiations scour the planet it's hard to imagine how even primitive plant life could survive here and water seems to have flowed only in the ancient past back in 1892 Camille Flammarion has filled his imaginary Martian canals with water speculating maybe the rectification of old rivers by the inhabitants for the purpose of general water distribution and the actual habitation of Mars by beings superior to our own is very probable Pickering adds fuel to flow Maryland's fire asserting that he has seen 40 lakes at about the same time a wealthy world traveling American diplomat is feeling like he needs a career change and a personal passion project Percival Lowell has read Flammarion books and he makes plans to look for Martians during the coming opposition of 1894 Pickering helps Lowell ring two telescopes on a hilltop in Flagstaff Arizona the new Lowell Observatory is trained on Mars all summer long at the telescope Lowell sees what he believes and sketches a complex irrigation system transporting billions of gallons of melted polar snow to equatorial desert oasis the irrigated agriculture projects of an advanced race but during the same opposition Edward Barnard wielding the California lick observatories larger refracting telescope cannot find a single straight line anywhere on Mars and when the licks William Campbell examines Mars with a spectroscope he sees not a trace of water in the atmosphere English astronomer Edward maunder demonstrates how straight lines on Mars could be optical illusions undeterred Percival Lowell Sprint's across America on a lecture to promoting his book named simply martyrs a story thirsty public buys his tales of Martian water works by the thousands the real Mars is a parched planet though tilted rocks tell us there were lakes here long ago with no liquid water to irrigate plants and no plants to hold the soil dust devils swirl across the barren terrain Curtin's of desiccated grit sweep up into the hazy sky from rugged Canyon cliffs sandy landslides garnished steep crater walls and clump on the floors Percival Lowell begins observing with an even bigger refractor but still cannot see his glaring error Lowell will carry on for 20 more years inventing over 450 canals with vegetation he pictures a desperate civilization bravely combating global climate change as their dying world cries to a planetary desert in fact Mars climate did change radically but it happened long before Lowell's time without a large moon to stabilize it Mars wobbles tens of degrees over hundreds of thousands of years much more radically than earth when Mars points a pole toward the Sun billions of tons of co2 are released unleashing a box of greenhouse warming melting subsurface ice flooding the planet HG Wells publishes War of the Worlds a dying race of Martians wants to conquer earth to make it more like Mars in 1976 earth will send two Viking

fission to drive spaceships at constant thrust project Orion a different approach to nuclear rockets starts testing hardware the idea is to detonate atomic bombs behind a ship to push it along it's called post plasma-wave propulsion outrageous as it seems this method could offer rapid transport to Mars and the rest of the solar system the u.s. nuclear engine for rocket vehicle application Nerva program accumulates 17 hours of live engine test time it raises hopes for Mars missions and moon bases in the Soviet Union engineers are working on nuclear thermal rockets of their own Soviet leaders have the specific goal of making Mars a politically red planet the Soviets try several times to send probes to Mars but they get no closer than 197 thousand kilometers and achieve very little science someday a manned trip to Mars and return may become the mission assignment to answer that challenge craft Araki a visionary German American engineer introduces the idea of ganging together clusters of nuclear rockets he argues that his modular approach could bring Mars and Venus within reach as early as the 1970s Erik a passionately believes that human expansion throughout the solar system is a fundamental right and that we are at our most dignified when we apply the laws of physics to elevate and protect human freedom just days before Apollo 11s lunar landing a monstrous moon bound Soviet n1 rocket rises 200 meters only to shut down and crash completely destroying its launch it is one of the largest non-nuclear explosions that humans have ever made the n1 might have ferried six cosmonauts on Mars missions lasting 630 days using nuclear-powered upper stages but when the u.s. wins the moon race the Kremlin's interest in the red planet seems to evaporate Mariner six flies within 3437 kilometers of Mars equatorial region this same year and Mariner 7 sails past Mars South Pole finding the temperature of chilly - 125 degrees Celsius with two moon landings fresh in mine the public expects NASA astronauts to go on to Mars but when Apollo 13 nearly ends in disaster President Richard Nixon fears the political consequences of another failure and tries to end the moon voyages Mariner 9 the first craft to orbit another planet finds conclusively Mars has no canals no cities no forests no as Apollo wines day no fun Brown proposes that Saturn five rockets lift the pieces of a pair of reusable nuclear-powered ships they would carry orbiters and surface expedition vehicles across the great void to Mars but Nixon shrinks the budget to only a space shuttle confining the human space program to low-earth orbit for what will turn out to be half a century in that time for United States Presidents will ask for Mars related programs but none will get much further than the planning stages there is growing suspicion among space advocates that large government space programs might be too slow and inefficient to ever get to Mars Engineers Robert Zubrin and David a Baker proposed Mars direct travel light they say and live off the land by making rocket fuel from the planet itself explorers could insure themselves a ride home by 1993 key ideas from Mars direct are finding their way into NASA's Mars design reference mission NASA will update the design for more times but consistent support for a direct affordable approach never fully materializes it's the private sectors turn the mars-1 company starts taking applications for one-way journeys to colonize the planet so called Mars to stay programs could dramatically reduce travel outlays but at what

UNDISPUTED,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hd3eBO9-SfI,0,1043720,9989,892,3185,hd3eBO9-SfI,oh we're look why Leonard end up Christmas are we know what Shannon's answer is Chris but what's your prediction my answer is the Los Angeles Lakers it's not a religion per se it is not it is a wishful thinking I'll leave a little space for the Raptors and very little for the Clippers move a little hmm yesterday Kauai group camp whatever you want they call it magic Johnson several times when magic was in church hmm magic gets out of church and gets the messages and they talk they told him what they were looking for you know two trainers you know training staff couple people are people on the staff Willie get the same treatment within the organization as LeBron James gets and you know just to call that the things they want oh do they read the news stories of late did they actually follow that magic quit on the Lakers yeah and then trash the gym like if this happens if this happens because they're gonna be two people you they should think the Lakers and L of LA Magic Johnson and LeBron James and by way of LeBron kind of clutch but Magic Johnson and LeBron James that's who's orchestrating this whole thing real talk and the thought that if it was true that Jamie thought about or Jeannie thought about trading LeBron is crazy because they're the ones getting this done believe that labelled beanie the respect libera has around the league respect and their magic is magic you're right I mean he obviously doesn't they should pay him a consultant's for something cuz they're gonna bring him back no this is look as long as Jeannie does not mess it up in the meeting cuz she's gonna meet with him as long as she doesn't mess it up and I don't think she will keep you tomorrow then they will I believe get quiet I'm sorry we don't do those things I believe he'll end up with the Lakers dare his first choice now the Clippers I'm told there's the concern or a kowai as part of who's the second guy like is there enough now to me Kauai is a made man like to say the criticism people level that Kevin Durant when he went to go on state you can't say that about kowai kowai is proven in a big 3 era that he can lead a team with no other superstars or stars to the champion about 4 stars stars out J ways again reduce he is there he is a made man so he can do whatever he wants now let me look at what remember this though about the Clippers Kauai could have easily said weeks ago well not weeks ago but as soon as the finals are over I want to go there talk to the Clippers I want to go there get get me Kim but give me a second guy weathers Kimber weathers Jimmy Butler Al Horford who then the Clippers would have made it happen so that tells you the preference has been the Lakers he grew up a Laker fan he did Toronto again I'm gonna live leave him a little chance a little wiggle room but I think this is a lifestyle he wants to be in Southern California and he Toronto Lou Williams we saw what Lou Williams said last week and this is a Toronto fans Canadians might not like it it's tough for American players to live there and I love visiting Toronto - I mean I I would not want to live there personally it's that what you're watching with what you can get on television the Roasterie stores new we're gonna said you got to get a Canadian banking account you go through customs every time you fly out to a game like in the United States so it's just different and I don't I don't think the Toronto fans if Kauai leaves can hold it against him I think when he goes back there next year if he's in a Laker uniform they got to give him a standing ovation of video tribute the whole nine yards he might even one day if nobody else does it that you get a statue I mean he will be the guy you'd have to give us faction 2 so I think it's Lakers yeah mmm that's what everything is pointing to this is all I got to say how do you want to Thomas Kyd I would you gotta say cuz I already know what's gonna happen by 7 o'clock this afternoon so he said it was a 97% chance that number two would sign with the Lakers by 6:00 p.m. today are you at that stage 98 99 where are you I'm probably not down 90 everything is 20 I think LeBron or he's gonna meet with LeBron and a knee or talk to him meet with her but the guy the diva no why would somebody want to play with a dude I thought is Mike okay I am hoping most I've ever hoped I'm not gonna say I'm praying cuz I don't pray for these kind of things but I'm hoping beyond hope that he does to both of you what he did to me in San Antonio that he leaves you both high and dry because both of you got your hopes kion you're coming out of the chairs now because your man LeBrons gonna have double help he's gonna have two guys to save him and prop him up next year sky are you gonna be against the widow I'm hoping that both of you by tomorrow are calling him number two the way I do because he's on your you-know-what list no no that was on your list look year he was going to the Clippers so I'm okay and he has said as late as last Friday I think he's got to go back to Toronto am i right we know what you asked me when they find out they cleared that max line I said give it a kowai but if we can't get Kawhi hmm then you backed off let's just spread the wealth so and so and so but after speaking to a few people yeah they became paying for me obviously they quiet little with a very very viable knock okay so now it's become it sounds like this death match between Lakers Clippers right because somebody's gonna get left actually actually that's right well I don't know about that I'm gonna say this one more time the Clippers it sounds like are going to get their meeting am I right about that you think they're gonna decline to even meet with them it's most likely they'll get their meeting well if they get their meeting your % is going to start plunging because these are some of the most persuasive people I know in the national Basketball Association because I do know Jerry West and I know Doc Rivers there they got fire power going on because when is the logo one is one of the best he's a top-five coach in the league and Steve Ballmer obviously didn't get where he is without a powerful personality yeah and he's got the deepest pockets and they have been aligning this whole franchise for a year to make this pitch that I think they're gonna make today but I don't know that guess what the Knights had been lying into their pocket lighted everything for a year but let me tell you somebody a wide-scale he's not gonna be moved by pitches you know why because there been so many people around him that tried to get him to change the way he looked cut your beard grew me do away with the corn roll let me say nobody ever said that I'm telling you nobody sanitorium said that they will listen to told San Antonio team that made you right now we Hollywood wanted to play in the shadows of Duncan Parker and Ginobili and wanted to play in the shadows in Toronto and sort of rose out of the shadows because nobody's paying attention until he bounced it four times on the rim in the game seven two lucky shot make history the players even paying attention to him until that moment is like oh my god how did he do that but I want you to stop but if I don't agree with that narrative but if that were true LeBron is the LeBron Joe still be the the face of the team so he can just why would that guy he's so so enjoyed playing in the shadows in San Antonio why would that guy want to join the circus because this is the biggest circus in all of sports it's gonna be the brightest hottest spotlight in all of sports not even gonna be played with and he's going to be the third wheel and every time LeBron has a third wheel Chris Bosh Kevin Love what happens in third wheel the goat as he calls him with big quotes around it the goat needs a scapegoat when the goat epic fails because he does I mean I'm being told LeBron is toll said he's gonna pull back I'll believe that when I see I will say there's a good recruiting pitch one I think LeBron shouldn't if they get Kawhi he should look at this as the Magic Johnson okay he should start playing like magic and played a point I know I don't think they're gonna do it but he should play the point and set up kawaii but I will give you some pushback because I want you to stop trying to do it there's a narrative that you tried to push that he wanted to be he was drafted by the Spurs he didn't have a choice because Tim Duncan was an MVP Finals MVP so was a Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili had led a team to the to the Olympic gold medal so he had no choice but to come in and the final no II was I'm not even sure you've gone in the first round if it wasn't for RC Buford trading up to get him in 15th we know now okay well you know now but nobody knew though so be thankful they got a championship he should be from before Thelma and Louise did anybody know who Brad Pitt was no sometimes it takes you a role and then everybody knows who you are hmm okay so what's your point my point is he got a little star I roll with this bird and I hear a little story they lifted they completely rebuilt his shot he had no shot he was strictly a defensive player at San Diego State and they took him and revamped him with the best shot doctor in all appreciate that we England get we fade he repaid us by quitting his way out he loved it he remembered you by giving you a championship out of Duncan Parker and Ginobili that's what was the area he should have been they should you know it and I know I can go back and show you and even the leading scorer and the finals that year and we get that up and so now now he's injury prone and you're gonna have three guys on the lake but they were injured but that's not your problem anymore the Spurs should worry about who is Reno we're gonna be we got it we got delayed I let's just start looking at the college ranks yeah you probably have gonna be lottery time oh yeah and we got Judi see wait how much can we bet on lottery time for San Antonio when a bet on that okay seriously how much wouldn't well I tell you what you won't you won't beat us I bet you have I'm just gonna hold your feet to the fire you just said the Spurs will not make the playoffs next let me think okay there we go somebody has to come out of that top seven or that top eight what do you mean is the latest like one of the tees that made the playoffs is coming out Oh cuz the Lakers look at it right Lakers are getting it now look at it by the way just got way way better we all beat you might be hitting the brakes hard when you run into those do you know we going to title right nobody go get a tattoo the ball thank you for

moonlanding,"The universe has long captivated us with its immense scales of distance and time. How far does it stretch? Where does it end, and what lies beyond its star fields and streams of galaxies extending as far as telescopes can see?

These questions are beginning to yield to a series of extraordinary new lines of investigation and technologies that are letting us to peer into the most distant realms of the cosmos. But also at the behavior of matter and energy on the smallest of scales. Remarkably, our growing understanding of this kingdom of the ultra-tiny, inside the nuclei of atoms, permits us to glimpse the largest vistas of space and time.  In ancient times, most observers saw the stars as a sphere surrounding the earth, often the home of deities. The Greeks were the first to see celestial events as phenomena, subject to human investigation rather than the fickle whims of the Gods. 

One sky-watcher, for example, suggested that meteors are made of materials found on Earth... and might have even come from the Earth. Those early astronomers built the foundations of modern science. But they would be shocked to see the discoveries made by their counterparts today. The stars and planets that once harbored the gods are now seen as infinitesimal parts of a vast scaffolding of matter and energy extending far out into space. 

Just how far began to emerge in the 1920s. Working at the huge new 100-inch Hooker Telescope on California's Mt. Wilson,  astronomer Edwin Hubble, along with his assistant named Milt Humason, analyzed the light of fuzzy patches of sky... known then as nebulae. 

They showed that these were actually distant galaxies far beyond our own. Hubble and Humason discovered that most of them are moving away from us. The farther out they looked, the faster they were receding. This fact, now known as Hubble's law, suggests that there must have been a time when the matter in all these galaxies was together in one place. 

That time, when our universe sprung forth, has come to be called the Big Bang. How large the cosmos has gotten since then depends on how long its been growing and its expansion rate. Recent precision measurements gathered by the Hubble space telescope and other instruments have brought a consensus... 

That the universe dates back 13.7 billion years. Its radius, then, is the distance a beam of light would have traveled in that time ... 13.7 billion light years. That works out to about 1.3 quadrillion kilometers. In fact, it's even bigger.... Much bigger. How it got so large, so fast, was until recently a deep mystery.

That the universe could expand had been predicted back in 1917 by Albert Einstein, except that Einstein himself didn't believe it until he saw Hubble and Humason's evidence. Einstein's general theory of relativity suggested that galaxies could be moving apart because space itself is expanding. 

So when a photon gets blasted out from a distant star, it moves through a cosmic landscape that is getting larger and larger, increasing the distance it must travel to reach us. In 1995, the orbiting telescope named for Edwin Hubble began to take the measure of the universe... by looking for the most distant galaxies it could see. 

Taking the expansion of the universe into account, the space telescope found galaxies that are now almost 46 billion light years away from us in each direction... and almost 92 billion light years from each other. And that would be the whole universe... according to a straightforward model of the big bang. But remarkably, that might be a mere speck within the universe as a whole, according to a dramatic new theory that describes the origins of the cosmos.

 immense scales of distance and time. How far out does it stretch? Where does it end, and what lies beyond the
 star fields and the streams of galaxies that extend as far as telescopes can see? These questions are beginning to yield to
 a series of extraordinary new lines of investigation, and to technologies that are letting us peer
 not only into the most distant realms of the cosmos but at the behavior of matter and energy
 on the smallest of scales. Remarkably, our growing understanding of this
 kingdom of the ultra-tiny, inside the nuclei of atoms, is now enabling us to glimpse the
 answer to the ancient question: How large is the universe? In ancient times, most observers saw the stars
 as a sphere surrounding the earth and as the home of deities. The Greeks were the first to see celestial
 events as phenomena, subject to human investigation rather than the fickle whims of the Gods. One philosopher and sky-watcher named Anaxagorus
 suggested that meteors are made of materials found on Earth and therefore, might have even
 come from the Earth. Those early astronomers built the foundations
 of modern science. But they would be shocked to see the discoveries
 being made by their counterparts today. The stars and planets that once harbored the
 gods are now seen as infinitesimal parts of a vast scaffolding of matter and energy that
 extends far out into space. Just how far began to emerge in the 1920s. Working at the huge new 100-inch Hooker Telescope
 on California’s Mt. Wilson, astronomer Edwin Hubble, along with an assistant named Milt
 Humason, analyzed the light of fuzzy patches of sky known then as nebulae. They showed that these were actually distant
 galaxies located far beyond our own. Hubble and Humason discovered that most of
 them are moving away from us. The farther out they looked, the faster these
 objects are receding. This fact, now known as Hubble’s law, suggests
 that there must have been a time when the matter in all these galaxies was together
 in one place. Everything that astronomers saw in their increasingly
 large telescopes would have dated back to a singular beginning, now called the Big Bang. That the universe could expand had been predicted
 back in 1917 by Albert Einstein, except that Einstein himself didn’t believe it until
 he saw Hubble and Humason’s evidence. Einstein’s general theory of relativity
 suggested that galaxies could be moving apart because space itself is expanding. So when a photon gets blasted out from a distant
 star, it moves through a cosmic landscape that is getting larger and larger, increasing
 the distance it must travel to reach us. So, how large the cosmos has gotten since
 the big bang depends on how long its been growing, in addition to its expansion rate. Recent precision measurements gathered by
 the Hubble space telescope and other instruments have brought a consensus, that the universe
 dates back 13.7 billion years. In that time a beam of light would have traveled
 13.7 billion light years, or about 1.3 quadrillion kilometers. But taking into account the expansion of the
 universe, the most distant galaxies discovered by the Hubble space telescope are actually
 46 billion light years away from us in each direction and almost 92 billion light years
 from each other. So is that the size of the universe? It’s not, according to a dramatic new theory
 that describes the origins of the cosmos. It holds that our 92 billion light-year patch
 is a mere speck within the universe as a whole. The theory is based on the discovery that
 energy is constantly welling up from the vacuum of space in the form of particles of opposite
 charge, matter and anti-matter. Back in the 1980s, the physicist Alan Guth
 proposed that energy fields embedded in the vacuum of space had suddenly tipped into a
 higher energy state, causing space and time to literally “inflate.” The universe went from atomic size to cosmological
 size within an infinitesimally short time. As a result, according to Guth’s calculation,
 the universe as a whole would have grown to some ten billion trillion times the size of
 the observable universe. That’s a ten followed by 24 zeroes. Put another way, the whole universe is to
 the observable universe - as the observable universe is - to an atom. The incredible fury of cosmic inflation helps
 explain the immense size and smoothness of the universe. But to succeed, the theory must also account
 for how the universe produced what we see around us, all those stars and galaxies and
 clusters of galaxies, and ultimately us. Scientists are now attempting to piece together
 the chain of events that launched our universe in its earliest moments by generating what
 you might call a “little bang.” At the Brookhaven National Lab in New York
 State, they are blasting gold atoms in opposite directions down tunnels almost two and a half
 miles long. When these atoms reach velocities just short
 of the speed of light, they are sent into a violent collision. A fireball erupts, reaching a temperature
 exceeding two trillion degrees Centigrade. As far as we know, the last time anything
 in our universe was that hot was about a millionth of a second after its birth. What interests the scientists is the splatter
 of subatomic particles, a super-hot soup of quarks and gluons that theory says gave rise
 to matter as we know it. In initial tests, this quark-gluon plasma
 has shown a crucial property: extremely low viscosity or resistance to flow. Scientists call it a perfect liquid. To grasp its importance, we go back to those
 primordial energy fields that the theory says spawned the big bang. The thinking is that those fields contained
 tiny fluctuations that were blown up to huge size during inflation. In the ultra-dense quark-gluon mix, these
 fluctuations generated pressure waves, or ripples. As the universe evolved, these ripples gave
 rise to variations in the density of matter. Amazingly, the imprint of those primordial
 ripples is out there today in a faint signal discovered accidentally back in the 1960s. Working for the Bell Telephone Company, physicists
 Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson had built a giant horn-shaped antenna. But wherever they pointed, the contraption
 picked up excessive noise in the microwave portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. That noise turned out to match a prediction
 made years earlier: that in the wake of the big bang, the universe was filled with a cloud
 of extremely hot gas that scattered all light. As the universe cooled, the cloud dissipated. Light then shone through Over time the spectral signature of this light
 would have shifted, as the universe expanded and cooled, to what Penzias and Wilson detected. What they’d heard was the echo of the Big
 Bang. This image shows the smooth contours of the
 light recorded by the Bell team. Scientists would have to look closer to find
 the imprint of cosmic inflation. The Space Shuttle Discovery lifted the Hubble
 Space Telescope into orbit on April 24, 1990, in one of the most important scientific milestones
 of our time. Another launch, arguably just as important,
 took place five months earlier. The Cosmic Observation Background Explorer,
 COBE for short, was sent up to take a harder look at the microwave radiation discovered
 by Penzias and Wilson. The results came out two and a half years
 later. The light of the early universe contained
 a pattern of hot and cold spots. In this image was nothing less than the origin
 of all we see around us today, smooth on a large scale, but with significant clumps from
 which gravity would form gas clouds, then stars, and galaxies. With this cosmic template in hand, astronomers
 set out to discover how the patterns and the dimensions of the universe evolved over time. In an age of computer controlled telescopes
 and automated observing, astronomers could now launch huge international collaborations
 with the goal of mapping a large fraction of the universe in three dimensions. At Apache Point in New Mexico, the Sloan Digital
 Sky Survey set the standard for mass production astronomy. A series of steel plates are drilled with
 holes that exactly match the location of galaxies in the night sky. After plugging fiber optic sensors into the
 holes, the plates capture the light of hundreds of galaxies per night. From that light the astronomers calculate
 their distances from Earth. Another survey is named the 2 Micron All Sky
 Survey, or 2Mass, after the frequency of infrared light its detectors are tuned to capture. In this image, the 2Mass data covers a region
 60 million light years across. The local group of galaxies, including the
 Milky Way, are in the center. This is our intergalactic neighborhood. Jump further out to a region about 200 million
 light years across. Our location is linked to the densely packed
 Virgo Supercluster, the nearest intergalactic city. Stepping out to a region over 320 million
 light years across, you can see the full breadth of our local region of the universe. Galaxies line up in walls and arcs. Beyond them are sparsely-populated voids,
 the rural cosmic countryside. Moving out with the data, this region is over
 650 million light years across. Then almost two billion. 3.2 billion. And finally out to a region 6.5 billion light
 years from end to end: the cosmic continent. In the middle of it all, our galaxy, so immense
 from our Earthly perspective, is less than a speck. The 2mass study, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey,
 and the 2 Degree Field in Australia have extended our maps to a quarter of the way back to the
 beginning of the universe. They have laid out a grand cosmic roadmap. COBE’s successor, the Wilkinson Microwave
 Anisotropy Probe, or “WMAP”, was launched to scan the early universe for the fine-scale
 origins of this cosmic atlas. WMAP traveled beyond any interference from
 Earth, to a position balanced between the Earth and the Sun. There, for two years, its detectors took in
 the pristine light of deep space. This is what WMAP saw: a pattern consistent
 with the filaments and voids that had evolved in the universe at large. Scientists are poring over the WMAP data for
 clues to the true dimensions of the universe. One group, for example, looked for repeating
 patterns that could be evidence of pressure waves that ricocheted through the hot gas
 of early times. They saw none, which implies that the universe
 had grown so large during inflation that such waves could not cross it. Then they did the math and reported that the
 entire universe must have a minimum diameter of 78 billion light years. So what is its maximum size, and what’s
 beyond that? We will never know for sure what lies beyond
 our visual horizon, but astronomers are turning up some surprising hints in the universe they
 can see. To ancient observers, the universe was made
 of five classical elements: Earth, Water, Air, Fire, and a fifth, Quintessence, or space. Aristotle believed the stars, unchanging and
 incorruptible, were made of this fifth element. Today, we are finding that space, in fact,
 has a character of its own. Astronomers have calculated the gravitational
 pull needed to bind stars as they orbit a galaxy or galaxies as they orbit a cluster
 of galaxies. They have found that there is simply nowhere
 near enough visible matter there to hold these structures together. The missing ingredient, its identity still
 unknown, they call: Dark Matter. In supercomputer simulations of cosmic evolution,
 dark matter is added in to supply the gravitational tug needed to form the web pattern of filaments
 and walls; voids and dense clusters we see in the universe at large. But something else appears to be happening
 on these large scales. Astronomers have been making refined measurements
 of the cosmic expansion rate with a new type of distance marker. They wanted to know if gravity was slowing
 down the pace at which the universe is growing. The markers they used, type 1A supernovae,
 are thought to burn at uniform intensities throughout the universe. By measuring changes in the brightness of
 these so-called standard candles at various distances, the researchers can spot changes
 in the cosmic expansion rate. To their surprise, the data showed that the
 universe as a whole is not only expanding, it’s actually accelerating outward! The culprit is thought to be energy welling
 up from the vacuum of space, similar to what occurred in the early moments of the Big Bang,
 causing cosmic inflation. By emerging in minute quantities everywhere,
 it is pushing space outward across the whole universe. Over time, this so-called “Dark Energy”
 has grown to an astonishing three-fourths of all the matter and energy in the universe. With data like this pointing to an underlying
 dynamic within our universe, some scientists are thinking of the cosmos in far broader
 terms than ever before. There is a version of inflationary theory,
 for example, that suggests we live in one of many universes, that may co-exist side
 by side but do not touch one another. Like bubbles, they are continually rising
 up and expanding across the oceans of infinity. Just 500 years ago, in Galileo’s time, many
 people looked out into space and saw a universe of lights centered on the Earth. The invention of the telescope revealed stars
 far from our planet, then galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and beyond them, vast walls and
 filaments of matter. Newer ideas about the size of the universe
 amount to a quantum leap in our sense of scale, by extending these structures far, far beyond
 our horizon. Do these discoveries push us, on our tiny
 out-of-the-way planet, into a smaller and smaller corner of Creation? Or does our ability to comprehend and imagine
 the far limits of time and space somehow expand our importance in the grand scheme of things?"
moonlanding,"The Solar System is a really big place, and it takes forever to travel from world to world with traditional chemical rockets. But one technique, developed back in the 1960s might provide a way to dramatically shorten our travel times: nuclear rockets.

Of course, launching a rocket powered by radioactive material has its own risks as well. Should we attempt it?

 it takes forever to travel from world to world with traditional chemical rockets. But one technique, developed back in the 1960s
 might provide a way to dramatically shorten our travel times: nuclear rockets. Of course, launching a rocket powered by radioactive
 material has its own risks as well. Should we attempt it? Let’s say that you wanted to visit Mars
 using a chemical rocket. You would blast off from Earth and go into
 low Earth orbit. Then, at the right moment, you’d fire your
 rocket, raising your orbit from the Sun. The new elliptical trajectory you’re following
 intersects with Mars after eight months of flight. This is known as Hohmann transfer, and it’s
 the most efficient way we know how to travel in space, using the least amount of propellant
 and the largest amount of payload. The problem of course, is the time it takes. Throughout the journey, astronauts will be
 consuming food, water, air, and be exposed to the long term radiation of deep space. Then a return mission doubles the need to
 resources and doubles the radiation load. We need to go faster. It turns out NASA has been thinking about
 what comes next after chemical rockets for almost 50 years. Nuclear thermal rockets. They definitely speed up the journey, but
 they’re not without their own risks, which is why you haven’t seen them. But maybe their time is here. In 1961, NASA and the Atomic Energy Commision
 worked together on the idea of nuclear thermal propulsion, or NTP. This was pioneered by Werner von Braun, who
 hoped that human missions would be flying to Mars in the 1980s, on the wings of nuclear
 rockets. Well that didn’t happen. But they did perform some successful tests
 of nuclear thermal propulsion and demonstrated that it does work. While a chemical rocket works by igniting
 some kind of flammable chemical and then forcing the exhaust gases out a nozzle. Thanks to good old Newton’s third law, you
 know, for every action there’s an equal and opposite reaction, the rocket receives
 a thrust in the opposite direction from the expelled gases. A nuclear rocket works in a similar way. A marble-sized ball of Uranium fuel undergoes
 the process of fission, releasing a tremendous amount of heat. This heats up a hydrogen to almost 2,500 C
 which is then expelled out the back of the rocket at high velocity. Very very high velocity, giving the rocket
 two to three times the propulsion efficiency of a chemical rocket. Remember the 8 months I mentioned for a chemical
 rocket? A nuclear thermal rocket could cut the transit
 time in half, maybe even 100 day trips to Mars. Which means less resources consumed by the
 astronauts, and a lower radiation load. And there’s another big benefit. The thrust of a nuclear rocket could allow
 missions to go when Earth and Mars aren’t perfectly aligned. Right now if you miss your window, you have
 to wait another 2 years, but a nuclear rocket could give you the thrust to deal with flight
 delays. The first tests of nuclear rockets started
 in 1955 with Project Rover at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. The key development was miniaturizing the
 reactors enough to be able to put them on a rocket. Over the next few years, engineers built and
 tested more than a dozen reactors of different sizes and power outputs. With the success of Project Rover, NASA set
 its sights on the human missions to Mars that would follow the Apollo landers on the Moon. Because of the distance and flight time, they
 decided nuclear rockets would be the key to making the missions more capable. Nuclear rockets aren’t without their risks,
 of course. A reactor on board would be a small source
 of radiation to the astronaut crew on board, this would be outweighed by the decreased
 flight time. Deep space itself is an enormous radiation
 hazard, with the constant galactic cosmic radiation damaging astronaut DNA. In the late 1960s, NASA set up the Nuclear
 Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application program, or NERVA, developing the technologies that
 would become the nuclear rockets that would take humans to Mars. They tested larger, more powerful nuclear
 rockets, in the Nevada desert, venting the high velocity hydrogen gas right into the
 atmosphere. Environmental laws were much less strict back
 then. The first NERVA NRX was eventually tested
 for nearly two hours, with 28 minutes at full power. And a second engine was started up 28 times
 and ran for 115 minutes. By the end, they tested the most powerful
 nuclear reactor ever built, the Phoebus-2A reactor, capable of generating 4,000 megawatts
 of power. Thrusting for 12 minutes. Although the various components were never
 actually assembled into a flight-ready rocket, engineers were satisfied that a nuclear rocket
 would meet the needs of a flight to Mars. But then, the US decided it didn’t want
 to go to Mars any more. They wanted the space shuttle instead. The program was shut down in 1973, and nobody
 tested nuclear rockets since then. But recent advances in technology have made
 nuclear thermal propulsion more appealing. Back in the 1960s, the only fuel source they
 could use was highly enriched uranium. But now engineers think they can get by with
 low-enriched uranium. This would be safer to work with, and would
 allow more rocket facilities to run tests. It would also be easier to capture the radioactive
 particles in the exhaust and properly dispose of them. That would bring the overall costs of working
 with the technology down. On May 22, 2019, US Congress approved $125
 million dollars in funding for the development of nuclear thermal propulsion rockets. Although this program doesn’t have any role
 to play in NASA’s Artemis 2024 return to the Moon, it - quote - “calls upon NASA
 to develop a multi-year plan that enables a nuclear thermal propulsion demonstration
 including the timeline associated with the space demonstration and a description of future
 missions and propulsion and power systems enabled by this capability.” So money is flowing back into nuclear rocket
 research. But what about fusion rockets? When do we get to see Epstein Drives from
 The Expanse? There’s good news on that front too, and
 I’ll talk about that in a second, but first I’d like to thank: Andrew Stewart
 Justin Olson Jessica Felts

 generous support. They contribute so that you can see these

 and get in on the action. Nuclear fission is one way to harness the
 power of the atom. Of course, it requires enriched uranium and
 generates toxic radioactive waste. What about fusion? Where atoms of hydrogen are squeezed into
 helium, releasing energy? The Sun has fusion worked out, thanks to its
 enormous mass and core temperature, but sustainable, energy positive fusion has been elusive by
 us puny humans. Huge experiments like ITER in Europe are hoping
 to sustain fusion energy within the next decade or so. After that, you can imagine fusion reactors
 getting miniaturized to the point that they can serve the same role as a fission reactor
 in a nuclear rocket. But even if you can’t get fusion reactors
 to the point that they’re net energy positive, they can still provide tremendous acceleration
 for the amount of mass. And maybe we don’t need to wait decades. A research group at the Princeton Plasma Physics
 Laboratory is working on a concept called the Direct Fusion Drive, which they think
 could be ready much sooner. It’s based on the Princeton Field-Reversed
 Configuration fusion reactor developed in 2002 by Samuel Cohen. Hot plasma of helium-3 and deuterium are contained
 in a magnetic container. Helium-3 is rare on Earth, and valuable because
 fusion reactions with it won’t generate the same amount of dangerous radiation or
 nuclear waste as other fusion or fission reactors. As with the fission rocket, a fusion rocket
 heats up a propellant to high temperatures and then blasts it out the back, producing
 thrust. It works by lining up a bunch of linear magnets
 that contain and spin very hot plasma. Antennae around the plasma are tuned to the
 specific frequency of the ions, and create a current in the plasma. Their energy gets pumped up to the point that
 the atoms fuse, releasing new particles. These particles wander through the containment
 field until they’re captured by the magnetic field lines and they get accelerated out the
 back of the rocket. In theory, a fusion rocket would be capable
 of providing 2.5 to 5 Newtons of thrust per megawatt, with a specific impulse of 10,000
 seconds - remember 850 from fission rockets, and 450 from chemical rockets. It would also be generating electricity needed
 by the spacecraft far from the Sun, where solar panels aren’t very efficient. A Direct Fusion Drive would be capable of
 carrying a 10 tonne mission to Saturn in just 2 years, or a 1-tonne spacecraft from Earth
 to Pluto in about 4 years. New Horizons needed almost 10. Since it’s also a 1 megawatt fusion reactor,
 it would also provide power for all the spacecraft’s instruments when it arrives. Much much more than the nuclear batteries
 currently carried by deep space missions like Voyager and New Horizons. Imagine what kinds of interstellar missions
 might be on the table with this technology too. And Princeton Satellite Systems isn’t the
 only group working on systems like this. Applied Fusion Systems have applied for a
 patent for a nuclear fusion engine that could provide thrust to spacecraft. I know it’s been decades since NASA seriously
 tested nuclear rockets as a way to shorten flight times, but it looks like the technology
 is back. Over the next few years I expect to see new
 hardware, and new tests of nuclear thermal propulsion systems. And I am incredibly excited at the possibility
 of actual fusion drives taking us to other worlds. As always, stay tuned, I’ll let you know

Adam Ruins Everything - Why Mount Rushmore is the Weirdest Monument | truTV
http://bit.ly/truTVSubscribe",Adam Ruins Everything - Why Mount Rushmore is the Weirdest Monument | truTV,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAaoJCsoVKQ,0,1073428,10725,1138,1485,CAaoJCsoVKQ,"Oh, I love Mount Rushmore. The history, the grandeur. The outdoor freeze-resistant
 pedestal fountains. It's America's greatest
 national monument.  I have to disagree.  Mouth Rushmore is America's
  weirdest national monument,    not the greatest. First, it's actually
  surprisingly small.   The heads are only  60 feet tall, or about one-tenth the size of
    the Washington Monument. And it was also never finished. The rubble at the base
 is just debris  from the construction
   no one cleaned up.    But most importantly,    the history of Mount Rushmore
    is real weird. Oh, yeah. I did always wonder why
 we carved president heads into the side of a mountain. What's up with that? Well, this national monument  was actually designed to be
  a national tourist trap.    In the 1920s, a group of
 South Dakota historians    was trying to figure out how to attract tourists
 to their state.    Hmm...  How do we get people to come
  see our big, boring rocks?   (gasps)  We'll carve wild west
  legends into them!    Cowboy rocks... Cowboy rocks...  (all)
  Cowboy rocks!  Cowboy rocks!  Cowboy rocks!   Bit of a leap.  Unfortunately for them,
 the sculptor they hired, a man named Gutzon Borglum--  Eww, bad name. Well, he had his own ideas. Screw this wild west crap.
 I shall fill your mountain... with presidents! A noble project that will
 immortalize me, Gutzon Borglum.  Okay.   But then he carved all our
   greatest presidents.    Washington was the first, Jefferson wrote the Declaration    of Independence,  Lincoln ended slavery
    and Roosevelt...  he... liked hunting? (Andy)
 And he was friends with
  the sculptor.   Teddy, you are
   the coolest. I'm gonna sculpt your face
 into a mountain.  Wow. You're, like, obsessed with me.
  (fires rifle) That's the reason he was
 on the monument? And people were cool with that?  They pretty much had to be. Borglum was incredibly stubborn
 about doing things his way.   In fact, his original plan
   for the monument was a little bit too ambitious. I'll sculpt the heads,    then their entire torsos,  and inside the heads,
  I'll build a hall of records,  and that's where we'll store    the Constitution and the Declaration of
  Independence! He wanted to put
 the Constitution in a mountain
 in South Dakota? I mean, I love South Dakota,
 and even I think that's insane. Yep. Borglum became
 so obsessed that Congress even threatened
 to cut his funding. I'm not paying for your
 passion project. Stick to the sculpture
 or you're cut off, Borglum!  But he had only finished the
  heads when, in 1941, he died. Uhh! Oh, come on!  Since the sculptor was dead and
  the project was out of money,  his workers decided
  to call it quits.   Well, we did the heads
   and Borglum's dead.    Time for us to go to bed.    Okay, so the sculptor
    was a maniac   whose name sounds like some
   Swedish muppet's death rattle,  and the monument
  was never finished.   That's not so bad. And it was built on stolen
 Native American land.  Yeah, that's worse. (Andy)   In 1868, the United States
  signed a treaty agreeing that this land would remain part of    the Sioux Nation. We've taken a lot from y'all, so you keep this land
 and we'll stay out. (Andy)
  But six years later,    that all changed when General Custer found gold.  You found what?  It's worth how much? Sorry!    Should have said
   ""no take-backsies.""   It was a real Custer fluck. In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled
 this land grab unconstitutional, and ordered federal compensation
    now worth over $1 billion. The problem is,
 the Sioux don't want the money. So to this day, it's sitting
 on hold in the U.S. Treasury.  Wait. Why don't you take the money? It was never
 about the money.  We just want our land back.  Think about it.   Our government broke a treaty,
   stole Native American land  and then carved our
  own leaders' faces into it. That's such an insult. And for what? So tourists can
 come see a big version of the heads on our money? I never thought I'd say this,
 but North Dakota was right."
moonlanding,"While we appreciate a good script, some of the greatest moments in movies come from when talented actors are given the leeway to go off-book. Here are 10 of the greatest scenes born of improvisation in movie history. Subscribe: http://goo.gl/9AGRm

What did you think of the list? Do you agree with our selections, or do you think some of our picks are overrated. Do you think we snubbed some of your favorite improvised scenes in our list? Do you have a favorite scene from the work of Robin Williams or Bill Murray?

Let us know in the comments!

THE LIST

Bridesmaids (2011)
A lot of this movie was the talented comedic actresses in the cast going off book, but Melissa McCarthy and Ben Falcone’s “Air Marshall” exchange takes the cake.

Apocalypse Now (1979)
Marlon Brando’s performance as Col Kurtz was largely made up on the spot. And while we don’t endorse actors not learning their lines, we can’t fault what came of it in this instance…

Iron Man (2008)
Robert Downey, Jr surprised everyone in his comeback performance as Tony Stark. Everyone - because most of what he said wasn’t in the script.

The Jazz Singer (1927)
Al Jolson’s improvised dialogue pretty much invented the entire concept of talking in movies. Think about that.

Caddyshack (1980)
Bill Murray’s been giving improvised performances his whole career, but his hilarious ad libbed “Cinderella Story” on the golf course made Caddyshack the movie it is today.

Goodfellas (1990)
The “Funny How?” exchange between Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta was a genius bit of collaboration between Joe Pesci and Martin Scorsese - and no one else in the scene.

The Breakfast Club (1985)
The climactic scene in which the teenagers finally bond over how they came to where they were was based entirely on the actors’ knowledge of the characters. And it worked.

This is Spinal Tap (1984)
It goes to 11. 

A Clockwork Orange (1971)
The home invasion scene never came together, until Malcolm McDowell was given reign to improvise on the next take. His brutal song-and-dance number makes this one of the most chilling scenes in movie history.

Robin Williams 
From “GOOOOD Morning Vietnam” to Night at the Museum, Robin Williams was master of improv, and his riffs enriched every role he ever inhabited. We’ll miss his unique voice for years to come.

Our friends over at IndieWire put together some seriously inspired MOVIE LISTS: http://bit.ly/12x0UpF and CineFix is bringing 'em to life!",Top 10 Improvised Scenes in Movie History,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNAajAflpBQ,0,3971213,28228,1939,2879,eNAajAflpBQ,">> Speaker 1: While most of Hollywood
 history is written with scripts, there's something special
 about going off book. And we're not just talking single lines. It's gotta be a back and forth,
 give and take, entire scenes. These are the top ten
 improvised scenes of all time. >> Speaker 1: When you think of improv, there's hardly a name that comes
 to mind before Judd Apatow's. Judd's been behind some of
 the decade's best ad libbing, from The 40-Year-Old Virgin,
 to Knocked Up, to Superbad. And it's mostly because he treats
 his actors like true equals in the creative process. As a result, he's helped launch the careers of some
 of the funniest guys in Hollywood. But for our list,
 we didn't pick any of them. Instead, our number 10 goes
 to the women in Bridesmaids. >> Speaker 2: No carry-on? >> Speaker 3: No. >> Speaker 2: Yeah, I noticed. I noticed you didn't put anything
 in the overhead bin either. And I get it, I get it. I want you to know. Protect and serve, Air Marshal style. >> Speaker 1: The 2011 breakout was
 hysterical from start to finish. Partly because of the killer script, but mostly because they usually
 tossed it out the window. Coming up with enough material for a 20 hour version of the movie
 that supposedly exists somewhere. And while the whole cast
 deserves a spot on this list, we've gotta give it up to the Air Marshal
 scene between Groundlings veteran Melissa McCarthy and
 her husband, Ben Falcone. >> Speaker 4: You're an errand boy, sent by grocery clerks. >> Speaker 4: To collect the bill. >> Speaker 1: Next up at number 9,
 Apocalypse Now. If you haven't heard the stories, you should definitely check out Hearts
 of Darkness, the making-of documentary. But it was a basically a year of
 heart attacks, seizures, typhoons, monsoons, actual war, and human
 corpses that drove the entire cast and crew to the breaking point. It also led to a cinematic masterpiece and some of the best
 improvised scenes to boot. And these weren't necessarily improv
 of invention so much as of last resort. Martin Sheen's opening scene was
 completely improvised and had him actually slicing his hand up because of his not so
 pretend intoxication. But we've gotta hand it to Marlon Brando's
 Colonel Kurtz for our number 9 slot. Of course, Brando's no stranger to improv. His famous monologue from On
 the Waterfront wasn't scripted either. >> Speaker 5: I could've been a contender. >> Speaker 1: But for Apocalypse Now,
 Brando showed up on set without having so much as read the script. He shut down the production for a week, while Coppola tried to get him to learn
 his lines by reading them to him out loud. And when that didn't work,
 Brando said he'd just wing it. So he babbled for 18 minutes worth of
 madness before declaring to Coppola that he couldn't think of anything else to say. And if he wanted more,
 he could hire another actor. >> Speaker 6: Is it better to be feared or
 respected? And I say, is it too much to ask for both? >> Speaker 1: Next up at number 8, we're looking at pretty much
 the entirety of Iron Man. That's right,
 Robert Downey Jr's motormouth Tony Stark was pretty much completely off the cuff. When studio executives greenlit the first
 entry into the modern Marvel franchise, they got a little too caught up in the
 special effects to worry about the script. By the time shooting rolled around,
 all they really had was an outline. So RDJ and director Jon Favreau
 sort of just winged it. And when Jeff Bridges had trouble wrapping
 his head around the chaos of it all, he says he just thought of it as
 a $200 million student film and rolled with the punches. wait a minute. You ain't heard nothing yet. >> Speaker 1: At number 7,
 The Jazz Singer. Back in 1927, when Warner Brothers set
 out to revolutionize the movie business with sound, they figured it would
 be perfect for musical numbers. They intended for
 people to sing, not talk. But when Al Jolson finished
 his first musical number, he did something that
 changed Hollywood forever. He started speaking. That's right, the whole concept
 of dialog came from an ad lib. As you can imagine, audiences ate it up. And the rest, as they say, is history. >> Speaker 1: Next up at number 6,
 none other than Bill Murray. Mr. Murray seems to be more myth than
 manly lately and for good reason. He's one of the most effortlessly
 funny human beings on the planet. After training at Second City improv,
 Bill went from National Lampoon to Saturday Night Live,
 to his breakout role in Meatballs. And he's been crafting scenes
 on the fly ever since. Whether he was ad libbing
 every line in Ghostbusters. >> Speaker 8: I feel so funky. >> Speaker 1: Stealing
 the show in Tootsie. >> Speaker 9: I wish I had a theater
 that was only open when it rained. >> Speaker 1: Or whispering something
 we'll never know into Scarlett Johansson's ear in Lost in Translation. of the classic comedy
 moments from our childhood. But for our pick, it's gotta be his
 Cinderella story from Caddyshack. >> Speaker 10: What
 an incredible Cinderella story. This unknown comes out of nowhere
 to lead the pack at Augusta. He's at his final hole. He's about 455 yards away. He's gonna hit about a 2-iron, I think. Cinderella story, out of nowhere. A former greenskeeper,
 now about to become the Masters champion. >> Speaker 1: The scene was scripted with
 only two lines of stage direction and meant as a simple transition shot. But the director,
 Bill's Second City co-star Harold Ramis, had a different idea and
 told Bill Murray to go wild. Which is exactly what he did. Now if you give Bill Murray and Harold Ramis two lines of stage direction,
 you end up with a scene like that. But if you give it Robert De Niro and
 Martin Scorsese, you're bound to wind up with
 something completely different. And that's exactly how we ended up
 with the famous mirror sequence from Taxi Driver. >> Speaker 11: You talking to me? >> Speaker 11: You talking to me? >> Speaker 1: But for our number 5, we're going with a different
 Scorsese improve scene. Yes, we're talking about the funny
 how scene between Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta in Goodfellas. >> Speaker 13: What do you mean I'm funny? it's funny, you're a funny guy. >> Speaker 12: What do you mean funny? Funny, how? How am I funny? >> Speaker 1: When Pesci told Scorsese
 a story about calling a mobster funny back when he was younger, Scorsese told him to
 recreate the incident on screen with Ray. The only catch was,
 that he didn't tell anybody else. The resulting scene perfectly captures
 the manic nature of Pesci's character, and the danger of the world they lived in,
 all without a single page of script. At number 4, The Breakfast Club. John Hughes shot this high school
 classic entirely in sequence. And when he arrived at the dramatic
 climax, where they all sit in circle and explain how they ended up there,
 Hughes tossed out the script and told them to improvise it. Letting the actors rely on
 the instincts they'd built up over the course of the shoot. And the result is one of the most
 touching scenes of the film. And we don't wanna give too much away,
 so we'll just let them do the talking. >> Speaker 14: What's bizarre? I mean, we're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it,
 that's all. >> Speaker 15: How are you bizarre? >> Speaker 16: He can't think for himself. >> Speaker 1: Now if there's one
 genre that's just a gold mine for improv, it's mockumentary. Borat saw Sacha Baron Cohen
 unleash his wild Kazakhstani antics on
 an unsuspecting public. And Christopher Guest has directed a long
 string of mockumentaries from Waiting for Guffman to Best in Show. But our number 3, goes back to where
 it all began with This Is Spinal Tap. >> Speaker 17: It's such a fine
 line between stupid and- >> Speaker 18: Clever. >> Speaker 1: Completely unscripted and
 based on a party gag, Rob Reiner shot Spinal Tap exactly
 as if it were a documentary. Taking nine whole months to essentially
 write the movie in the edit bay. But if we had to pick a single scene from
 Spinal Tap, even though there are so many, it's always gotta be the one
 with the amp that goes to 11. >> Speaker 17: This is a top
 to what we use on stage, but it's very, very special because,
 if you can see. >> Speaker 18: Yeah. >> Speaker 17: The numbers all go to 11. One louder. >> Speaker 18: Why don't you just make ten
 louder and make ten be the top number and make that a little louder? >> Speaker 17: These go to 11. >> Speaker 1: Kubrick's widely known
 as one of the most meticulous and controlling directors to ever walk a set. Hardly letting anyone change so
 much as a single line. But if you look at his body of work, he's gotta surprising amount
 of improv throughout. >From Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove. >> Speaker 19: Mein Fuhrer! I can walk! >> Speaker 1: To R Lee Ermey's
 nonstop abuse in Full Metal Jacket. not even have the God damn common
 courtesy to give him a reach around. >> Speaker 1: And even Nicholson's
 classic line from The Shining. >> Speaker 21: Here's Johnny. >> Speaker 1: But our number 2 goes to
 the home invasion from A Clockwork Orange. >> Speaker 22: Just singin' in the rain. What a glorious feeling. I'm happy again. >> Speaker 1: Kubrick had spent
 four days working on the scene and still felt that something wasn't working. Frustrated, he asked Malcolm McDowell
 if he could try something else, perhaps a dance, in the next take. So McDowell decided to include
 a song with his dance. And he belted out the only one he could
 remember at the time, which just so happened to be Singin' In The Rain. The result is one of the eeriest
 juxtapositions caught on film. And it just so
 happened to be completely unplanned. And finally at number 1, pretty much the entire body of work of the
 master of improv himself, Robin Williams. We're sad to let him go but
 grateful for the laughs he left behind. Here's to Robin. >> Speaker 23: Good morning, Vietnam! 10,000 years will give you
 such a crick in the neck. Hello. She used to fart in her sleep. it woke the dog. What's the weather like out there? It's hot, damn hot, real hot! Hottest things is my shorts. I can cook things in it. Well, can you tell me what it feels like? >> Speaker 23: Son of a bitch. Stole my line. >> Speaker 1: So what do you think? Did we leave out one of your
 favorite improv scenes? Did you find one of our picks
 to be wildly overrated? Let us know in the comments below and

The lobby shootout in the original Matrix film is not only a great shootout, it’s a beautiful intersection of action and effects. 

The Killer (1989)
Director: John Woo
Director John Woo is famous for his amazing gunfight sequences (and his use of birds) but the final Church Shootout from The Killer is our absolute favorite of his work. 

The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly (1966)
Director: Sergio Leone
Proving that a great shootout doesn’t need to include an absolute hail of bullets, the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly manages to ramp up the tension with a mere 2 bullets (along with some amazing cinematography and music)

No Country for Old Men (2007)
Director: The Coen Brothers
The Coen Brothers are masters of their own style of violence, and nowhere is that more apparent than the cat-and-mouse gun battle between Anton Chigurh and Llewelyn.

Scarface (1983)
Director: Brian De Palma
Come on, is there anything more iconic than being told thy Tony Montana’s “Say Hello to my little friend!”?

The Wild Bunch (1969)
Director: Sam Peckinpah
The use of slow-motion and complicated editing in The Wild Bunch was the genesis of a lot of Western showdowns for years to come.

Heat (1995)
Director: Michael Mann
The face-off between Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in the robbery sequence is notable if only for the stars appearing in it… but the visceral reality of this sequence is what earns it our top spot.",Top 10 Movie Shootouts of All Time,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIJ3NKHfi4U,0,1754168,15498,745,3317,pIJ3NKHfi4U,">> Speaker 1: We're not quite sure if
 gun violence in movies is harmless make-believe, or These are the Top 10
 Movie Shootouts of All Time. >> Lt. Archie Hicox: It would appear
 there's only one thing left for you to do. >> Major Dieter Hellstrom: And
 what would that be? >> Speaker 1: Kicking us off at number 10, it's hard to talk about shootouts
 without Tarantino's name coming up. He's a man with a fondness for
 graphic violence of all types and his filmography reflects his knack for it. >From the standoffs in
 Inglorious Bastards and Reservoir Dogs, to the vengeful butchery
 of Candyland in Django Unchained, he's made a career on
 spectacular gun deaths. We should even mention
 the shootout from True Romance, since Tarantino wrote the script. And while we wanna give him
 all the credit that he's due, our number 10 actually goes
 to a good friend of his. >> Right Hand: Friends of yours? >> Pick-up Guy: I, look, I swear, Robert Rodriguez and the badassery
 that is his Desperado bar shootout. that pop out of his sleeves in what
 seems like a very unlikely fit. Antonio Banderas kicks off the killing
 in Desperado with some impressive moves against an entire
 bar of red shirt bad guys. Culminating in a one on one blind
 machine gun spray and pray and a hilarious amount of empty clips. Desperado is Rodriguez's sequel
 to El Mariachi his debut feature that he shot for
 a rumored $7,000 famously carting the camera around on a wheelchair
 in lieu of an actual dolly. But he got a serious upgrade with
 Desperado, and he netted himself a whole lot more guns, blood, and
 Antonio freaking Banderas with the loop. >> Speaker 1: Next up at number 9,
 we've got to love a shootout with the mob. There's the final shootout from
 the Departed, hit girls incredible shootout from Kick Ass, and the inverted
 russian mob shootout from Boondock Saints. And while we're at it, we should take a moment to bask in
 the absurdly over the top insanity of Willem Dafoe's reenactment of their front
 yard shootout from elsewhere in the film. >> Paul Smecker: There was a fire fight. >> Speaker 1: However our number 9
 goes to a relatively unknown cope classic State of Grace for
 it's final shootout. worth checking out if
 you haven't seen it yet. It follows undercover cop Sean Penn as
 he returns to the neighborhood that he grew up in as he gets
 involved with the Irish mob. But the shootout is just spectacular. A far cry from the super-heroics
 of other entries on this list, it's hard to know if
 anyone makes it out alive. It's slow, intense, and brutal, and
 conflicted in its depiction of violence. And the sound is the best part. With everything silent except for
 the gunshots, the focus rests solely on the death and destruction that unfolds before us,
 not the acrobatic heroics of a gunslinger. It almost reminds us of another
 great silent shootout that just missed this list
 from Road to Perdition. But it's definitely a sleeper classic, and
 it's hard to watch in all the best ways. So, any shootout fan should bite
 the bullet and give it a chance. >> Speaker 1: Next up we're looking at
 the next generation savagery directors come up with when they combine
 shootouts with science fiction. And we got some awesome choices here from
 the warehouse shootout in Robocop, to the police office massacre in Terminator,
 to another Arnie bloodbath in Predator. And we really wish we could pick he
 hallway shootout from Equilibrium, because it's cool, and flashy,
 and campy, and blast to watch. But it's just not quite impressive
 enough to edge out our number 8 pick, with the lobby shootout from The Matrix. >> Security Guard: Please remove any
 metallic items you're carrying, keys, loose change. >> Speaker 1: Seems like hardly a list
 goes by when we're not talking about The Matrix, but here we are again with another
 exemplary action sequence from the film. And this probably shouldn't come as much
 of a surprise, seeing how it's not exactly controversial to claim that The Matrix
 will go down in film history as a classic. And check out this scene. The destruction of
 the entire lobby is crazy. Not just because of how gratuitous it is,
 but look behind the scenes. This stuff wasn't CGI. It was brilliantly coordinated
 special effects, and what's more, they've gotta deal with
 actors messing up like this. Which would have meant they had to reset
 the entire gag back to the beginning, rebuilding whatever column and
 re-rigging it with new charges. It's no wonder the entire sequence
 took ten whole days to shoot, what with all the stunts, explosives,
 and wire work throughout. And the result is a marvel to watch,
 not so much one of those shootouts where
 you're under the edge of your seat, wondering if our heroes
 will make it out alive. But wondering just how badly they'll
 manage to mess up the bad guys. And in this case, it's pretty clear
 the answer is very, very bad. aren't limited to the domain
 of American filmmakers. There's plenty of international
 claim to the shootout crowd. And when it comes to modern full-throttle,
 balls to the wall insanity, there's no director with
 better pedigree than John Woo. That's right,
 Woo is pretty much the craziest, most recognizable, most influential action
 director to come out of Hong Kong cinema, and he's got the shootouts to show for it. In fact, he's made such a career of
 awesome shootouts that most of his movies have two or
 three that we considered for this list. Hard Boiled has the opening
 tea house shootout, the absolutely absurd warehouse shootout,
 and the final long take hospital Shootout. And Face/Off has one or
 two shootouts of its own. But for our pick for number 7, we're going with one of his
 awesome shootouts from The Killer. No, it's not the badass double-crossing
 shootout in Chow Yun Fat's apartment. And no it's not the even higher
 intensity shootout where Chow and Lee defend a house against dozens of
 indistinguishable, generic bad guys. Our number 7 goes to the final,
 epic church shootout, that sees the two heroes mow down
 armed assailants like untamed grass, as they burst in through
 every entrance imaginable. Shooting blindly in a scene
 that took 36 days to shoot, and over 40,000 rounds of blank ammunition. This film managed to inspire our
 earlier pick, Desperado, as well as some other films that just missed this
 list, like The Professional and Nikita. Yes, it's over the top,
 melodramatic, and gratuitous, but it's all those things in the best possible
 way, which is exactly why love them. >> Speaker 1: Of course if we're going
 to honor international directors it's pretty much required that we turn
 our eye to spaghetti westerns. A string of Italian made American
 westerns that emerged in the 1960's. And while DJango deserves an honorable
 mention for it's coffin mounted machine gun massacre, we've gotta look
 to the spaghetti OG, Sergio Leone. A massively important filmmaker for
 the genre. He's actually one of John Woo's
 biggest cited inspirations. Known for his bleak use of widescreen,
 long staring closeups, and tension more than his actual violence, Leone has enough
 great shootouts to fill this whole list. Of course, we can only pick one. But it's really not that hard, after all. We really wish we could pick the awesome
 armour-plated final shootout from A Fistful of Dollars, or the train station shootout from
 Once Upon a Time in the West. But we would be doing this list a great
 disservice if we picked anything but The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. For a shootout, there are very few gun
 shots here, only two to be precise. But that doesn't keep this from being
 one of the most tense sequences in film history, thanks to Leone's impeccable
 direction and Morricone's historic score. Extreme wides cut in with extreme
 close-ups has come to be know as one of Leone's trademarks. Along with the circular arena made up for
 this custom-built graveyard that was thrown up in two days by 250
 Spanish soldiers for the sequence. Leone's camera says so much more
 than his silent characters, and for that we have to honor this
 career-defining masterpiece. cowboys, cops and gangsters don't
 have the monopoly on shootouts. We can't forget about soldiers, so we're
 looking to war films for our number 5. There are some great shootouts in
 the likes of Black Hawk Down, basically, half of Lone Survivor and
 the sniper battle from The Hurt Locker. But for our number 5,
 we're going with Saving Private Ryan. >> Speaker 1: In terms of battle scenes
 most people hear Private Ryan and think of the D-Day landing sequence
 that is certainly famous for a reason. But that's about as much of a shootout
 as dump trucks are commuter cars. So it has no real place on this list. And although it's an oft forgotten middle
 child, the sniper scene is phenomenal. Interestingly enough, the shot taken here is actually based on a
 real shot, although not from World War II. During the Vietnam war,
 a marine Private Hatchcock was engaged in a sniper battle with
 an entrenched Viet Cong. When he saw a glare from
 the enemy's sniper scope, and put a round through the scope and
 into his eye. Gripping, emotional, filled with
 restraint and cathartic in its climax, you probably won't realize you were
 holding your breath until it's over. >> Private Jackson: My God,
 I trust in thee. Let me not be ashamed. we're giving it to the geniuses
 that are Joel and Ethan Cohen. And, no, not the Danny Boy Tommy Gun
 shootout From Miller's Crossing, although that's pretty badass,
 if a bit cartoonish. We're talking about the masterfully
 constructed game of cat and mouse between Llewelyn Moss and
 Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men. the pitch black game waiting
 game through the hotel door, to Llewelyn's near escape down a silent
 alleyway, to their duel across the street. Everything about this sequence
 is hyper-realistic, except for maybe the shotgun silencer. In fact, the one thing that should
 most speak to the restraint of the sequence is that much like
 the rest of the movie, the hero and the villain never come face to face. Not only that, they never so
 much as inhabit the same room or even share a shot on screen. And yet the Cohens managed to construct
 a shootout that's not only, functional and dramatic, but memorable and dangerous. Spliced together in a series almost and near misses,
 it's minimalism at its most effective. >> Tony Montana: You wanna play games? Okay, I play with you. >> Speaker 1: To hell with restraint. While we love a seething
 duel of the minds, we're equally fond of blazing guns and
 high body counts. Enter Brian De Palma. Yes, he's pretty well-known for his Untouchables shootout that pays equal
 homage to Eisenstein and Hitchcock. But our number 3 goes to the bloody
 climax of Scarface that sees Tony Montana introducing the world to
 his small acquaintance. >> Tony Montana: Say hello
 to my little friend. actually an M16 assault rifle with an M203
 40-millimeter grenade launcher And even though it is filmed with blanks,
 Pacino grabbed it by the muzzle after Another cool bit of technical trivia
 is that the guns in this sequence were all electronically synchronized
 with the camera shutter so that it captured the muzzle
 flashes more effectively. But enough nerding out. Let's just look at the awesome carnage
 in the shape of multiple explosions, wave after wave of attackers
 turned into hot lead swiss cheese. And an unbelievably stubborn Montana who,
 after dozens of bullet wounds, is notoriously still standing. >> Tony Montana: I'm still standing. >> Speaker 1: Where other directors on
 this list had made violence heartbreaking, terrifying and brutal in equal measure, Even if it was ultimately meant
 as critical or satirical. But, that doesn't take away from
 the absolutely epic, enthralling, and iconic nature of this shootout. So, we're happy to count
 it as one of the best. in case you haven't had enough of
 westerns, we've got one more for you. And it's not Butch Cassidy, Shane,
 Open Range, 3:10 to Yuma, Unforgiven, Tombstone, or High Noon. Although those shootouts are all worthy
 honorable mentions in their own right. For our number 2,
 our pick belongs to one man. Sam Peckinpah and his master class of
 a shootout that is The Wild Bunch. >> Mapache: What do you want? >> Pike Bishop: We want Angel. >> Speaker 15: You want Angel, no? Right, I am going to give it to you. notorious for his violent films,
 violent relationships, and alcohol abuse. He's rumored to have been so frustrated with his crews inability to
 capture real gunfire with their special effects that he grabbed a real revolver
 and emptied it into a nearby wall. Showing them exactly
 what he was looking for, The violence of the film was
 seriously criticized at the time. But Peckinpah cited a desire
 to turn the sanitized TV westerns on there heads with a film that
 actually showed the realities of violence, as it appeared on TV's daily
 in Vietnam war footage. And it be a hard sound to suggest
 that Peckinpah held back with the violence here. Pretty much no one is spared in
 this legendary suicide mission. And they didn't have enough costumes for
 all the people Peckinpah wanted to murder, so most actors would die,
 wash off their costumes then go die again. But the scene is notable for
 more just it's successes. It's also a landmark in editing and
 staging perfectly mixing film at six different levels of slow motion and
 cross cutting. Between a multitude of different
 arenas of simultaneous action while remaining coherent for audiences. >> Neil McCauley: Stay down. We want to hurt no one. We're here for the banks' money,
 not your money. Your money is insured by
 the federal government. You're not gonna lose a dime. Think of your families. Don't risk your life. Don't try and be a hero. >> Speaker 1: And finally, coming in at our number 1, we're looking
 at the incredible work of Michael Mann. He's orchestrated awesome shootouts in
 films like Collateral, Public Enemies, and Miami Vice, but nothing can ever live up
 to the perfection that is the robbery sequence from Heat. De Niro and Pacino that fans
 had always been waiting for. The sequence is notable and that it is
 both incredibly gratuitous, bombastic, and intense while still seeming to be more
 real than any other shootout ever shot. And well that’s mostly because it is. Michael Mann put his actors through
 such a rigorous amount of training in preparation for this film that they
 pretty much did everything for real. They dressed up in disguises and cased
 the actual bank during operating hours, escaping undetected in a get away vehicle. The cops were introduced to, and
 socialized with actual cops. The criminals were introduced to, and socialized with actual
 professional criminals. All the actors spent three months training in heavy
 weapons in preparation for this film. With the police officers
 receiving police training, and the robbers receiving alternate training. And it all culminated with
 Mann building a life-size, to-scale replica of the entire
 street on the shooting range. And putting the actors through
 a live-fire version of the shootout. Except against targets not each other. The film is often lauded for
 how absolutely massive it sounds. Now when it comes to the sound effects,
 most films have all their gun shots hits and ricochet replaced by the post
 production sound team after the fact. It's probably a safe bet to assume
 that every other film on this list did just that. And he did this too using three post
 production sound stages to simotaniously create a massive mix of the scene,
 until Micheal Mann heard it, and hated it. And threw it all out in order to replace
 it with the audio they recorded on set. Booming with the coffinous echoes of
 800 to 1000 blank rounds per take ricocheting off the walls
 of the downtown corridor. It's meticulous, visceral, heart pounding
 filmmaking and it's just about the realest example of on screen gun
 violence ever committed to film. Which is why we think it's
 the number 1 shootout of all time. Did we leave out one of
 your favorite shootouts? Do you disagree with one of our picks? Let us know in the comments below, and be sure to subscribe for more Cinefix movie lists."

Hi, welcome to another ColdFusion video. The human mind is truly an incredible thing, capable of speech, thought, critical thinking, and imagination. When we think of the great legendary minds of this world, we think of the brilliance of people like Einstein. He taught us many things about the low-level rules that govern our universe, fundamental things like time, space and matter, but in terms of practical discoveries that are the basis for the technologies we use each and every day, it was Nikola Tesla. Who was the most brilliant of all. He had a mind of the rarest kind. He can memorize entire books and visualize inventions with pinpoint accuracy. Once he had the concept of an invention fully visualized, he then undertook the hard work of bringing it to reality. In comparison, most other scientists and engineers are unwittingly narrow-minded in their thinking. How is it that such a man exists vaguely in the public consciousness, only as a fuzzy haze of distant knowledge? Today, let's change that. In this video, you'll learn all about Nikola Tesla and the way he changed the world you live in now. Let's begin. Tesla of Serbian heritage was born in 1856 in a small village within the Austrian Empire or modern-day Croatia. Tesla's birth was during a particularly violent lightning storm. Reading this as a bad omen, the midwife said to Tesla's mother that Tesla would be a child of darkness. Tesla's mom immediately replied: ""No, he will be a child of light."" As we'll see later, this statement was significant. From an early age, it was clear that Tesla was a remarkable kid. While in high school, he had the ability to perform integral calculus in his head. It was so unusual that his teachers thought he was cheating. Tesla also possessed an eidetic memory, which means he could recall entire books and images in great detail — a gift which he attributes to his mother. He allegedly used his imagination to temper visions and vivid nightmares that he had as a child. Unsurprisingly, Tesla finished high school early. At age 17 though, Tesla had a brush with death after contracting cholera in which he pleaded he might live if his father let him study engineering instead of the planned path of a priest, or a career in the army. Tesla's father agreed. Despite being bedridden and incredibly ill at the time, to the astonishment of his family, he miraculously recovered. Keeping true to his agreement, Tesla's father allowed the teenager to study engineering at university. And the course of history would be changed forever at that moment. During University in Austria, at age 21, Tesla got the highest grades possible, could speak eight languages, and was called a star student of the first rank by the University's dean. Tesla claimed to work from 3:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. daily. And because of this, professors wrote a letter to Tesla's father stating that his son may be killed due to overwork. At the end of his second year, things took a turn. Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling, and by his third year, Tesla had gambled away his entire allowance and tuition money. He did, however, manage to gamble back the losses and return the balance back to his family, but the damage to his studies had been done. When exam time came around, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but he was denied. He never graduated from the University and did not receive grades for his last semester. In December of 1878, to hide the fact that he had dropped out of university, Tesla cut all ties with his family. It was so sudden that his friends had thought he had drowned in a river in North Croatia. In 1880, he moved to Budapest and then finally to America with just four cents in his pocket. After taking up a few odd jobs here and there, Tesla began his work for Thomas Edison at consciente Edison company, in 1882. Here's a word on Edison: Many people today consider Thomas Edison as the father of the light bulb, but he was more along the lines of the Steve Jobs of the light bulb. That is, Edison figured out how to sell the light bulb by improving on ideas of 22 other men before him. Thomas Edison went on to found General Electric, which I also have a video on, so if you want to see that, check the description below. Okay, so back to this story. In 1885, Tesla said that he could redesign Edison's DC motors and generators which were very inefficient at the time, and had a tendency to spark and break down. Edison liked the idea and offered Tesla 1 million US dollars in today's currency for the job. Tesla got to work and did as he was promised, fixing all the problems with the motors. The new motors and generators were now simpler, didn't spark, and were much more reliable. In fact, Tesla's design was so good that it still used today for the motors that power anything from household appliances, to water pumps, power tools, disk drives, smartphone haptics feedback systems, and, of course, the Tesla electric car. When Tesla had completed this job and asked for the money, Edison laughed and stated: ""Mr.Tesla, you do not understand our American humor."" Tesla had just been ripped off big time, and left Edison's company. He'd had enough. Meanwhile, at this time, something monumental was happening: the electrical revolution was just about to take place. Electricity was the next big thing to change the entire planet. It created an investment startup bubble, much greater than the fever that was the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. Billion dollar industries arose out of nowhere, and the American economy was lifted into an enhanced growth period that would last for decades. This was due to sudden quantum leaps in manufacturing, household technology, and general efficiency of work. Work and life was simply easier. We simply just can't comprehend this change today. Why, you might be asking. Because everyone alive today was born with electricity. The sheer magnitude of technological change that resulted from household electricity was truly astonishing So, after being cheated by Edison, Tesla decided to put his energy into joining the electric revolution in the form of the research of alternating current, or AC. While he searched for financial backers to support his vision of an AC powered world, Tesla took up a job of digging ditches for $2 a day, or $50 in today's currency to make ends meet. He described this period as very painful. Tesla eventually struck up a partnership with Westinghouse. This would put him in direct competition with Edison and his direct current or DC system backed by General Electric. Edison's DC system created dangerous sparks, couldn't transmit electricity very far, required a power plant every few kilometers with cables as thick as your arm. In other words, it was pretty terribly suited to power every home on this planet. Tesla's AC system, on the other hand, used thinner wires, had higher voltages, and could transmit electricity over long distances. The fight was on, and the prize for the winner was the privilege of lighting up the entire world. By 1893, there had been many shady business deals, stolen ideas and patent suppression that Edison and his money interests wielded over Tesla's inventions. The feud had reached boiling point, and with this, the war of the currents had reached its peak. Deep down, Edison knew that his system was inferior to Tesla's. But, of course, he didn't want the public to know this. He needed a way to make the public despise AC and accept DC. But how? Families living near Edison's laboratory began to notice something a little strange. Their pets suddenly began to disappear These mysterious disappearances weren't the work of aliens, but of a group of schoolboys paid 25 cents for each animal that they stole. This was Edison's solution. Once Edison gathered the cats, dogs, and other animals from the school boys, he publicly electrocuted them using Tesla's AC current to prove that it was dangerous, too dangerous to be used in any home. In addition to this, Edison aided in the creation of the electric chair making sure that it used AC current. Tesla responded to all of this by demonstrating that AC was perfectly safe by famously shooting electric current through his own body to produce light at the 1893 World Fair. This was checkmate to Edison and a symbolic turning point. As the years went on, AC increased in popularity and became the standard due to its technical advantages. As a result of his inventions, Tesla was shot into the stratosphere of stardom, rubbing shoulders with the most important people of the day. He was universally loved by citizens because he helped to make their lives easier. From arriving with just four cents in his pocket to now have an unprecedented fame, things have certainly changed for Tesla, and his brilliance and hard work had paid off for him. Meanwhile, Edison became more and more despised by others within General Electric and eventually lost control of the company after a series of mergers. With all of that being said, to give Edison some credit, he did invent the phonograph and motion picture camera, so he also has contributed greatly to society. During the War of the currents, Tesla designed AC motors, generators, transformers, and power transmission technologies, resulting in 25 of the most valuable patents since the invention of the telephone. These designs were so good that we still use them today in all the systems that power our homes, a fact which we take for granted. This in itself was an incredible achievement by Tesla, but he was just getting started. Over the next few years, Tesla would invent a few foundational technologies that drove the 20th century and still hold relevance today. We'll take a look at that in a second, but before we do, I think it's time for a quick break, so grab a bite to eat get comfortable, readjust, and we'll be back in a bit."

rather it's a collection of rocks that astronauts picked up off the surface of the Moon they have led to a whole new understanding of Earth's early years and of our moons mysterious beginnings it's the brightest object in the night sky for millennia the moon has defined the rhythms of life and animated our myths it has played a central role in our planets history by stabilizing Earth's rotation about its axis and with its tides promoting the formation of ocean currents that shape our climate and yet within its brilliant light is one of the most vexing questions in all of science where did the moon come from at the dawn of the Space Age in the 1950s there were three competing theories about the moon's origins one held that it was part of the earth cast off by the rapid spin of our planet in its early days another saw the moon as a wayward object that floated through our solar system and was captured by Earth's gravity a third idea held that the moon formed right alongside the earth scientists from the Soviet Union and the United States sought to test these theories with a fleet of unmanned lunar probes shooting pictures taking readings and crashing onto its surface to settle the question we needed to go down on to the surface of the Moon to see it with our own eyes and bring a piece of it back to our labs on earth but the quest to obtain samples from the moon was fueled as much by science as by competition between the two nations the race to space began on October 4th 1957 when the Soviet Union launched a satellite called Sputnik higher and faster than anything before sputnik's beef was a wake-up call for the United States it led to the creation of NASA and a mission to get an American into space the Soviets then launched Sputnik 2 it was six times heavier and had a passenger a dog named Laika surprising the world again the Soviets launched a spacecraft on April 12 1961 that carried a man into space cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin from 1957 till 1965 the Soviets routinely bested their American counterparts to overtake the Russians president John F Kennedy had to aim high he committed the United States to the goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade nothing so grand as ever so easy the Gemini program was set up to build the skills and technologies needed for a successful lunar mission it had its share of mishaps and failures the Soviets were working on their own moon shot with the giant n1 launcher it had a complex design that included 30 engines on its first stage all of which had to work flawlessly and in sync testing on the different stages of the n1 started in 1968 followed by for full-scale unmanned launches meanwhile the American lunar program penned its hopes on the mighty Saturn 5 rock the first manned launch of the Saturn 5 would carry the Apollo 8 capsule to the moon and into lunar orbit Apollo eight coasted to the moon and successfully returned both nations now had a lunar landing in sight on July 13th 1969 the Soviets launched Luna 15 the third in a series of robotic craft designed to land on the moon analyze lunar dirt and fly samples back to earth Apollo 11 blasted off three days later Luna 15 arrived on schedule but Soviet controllers kept it in orbit to check its onboard systems on July 20th 1969 Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin began their descent to the lunar surface computer overload alarms cause the Eagle Lana to enter shoot its designated landing site flying above boulders as big as houses and running low on fuel Armstrong took a manual control and searched for a spot to touch down rocket tranquility we got to get on the ground you gotta fight the guy about the boy and bring it again the two astronauts were out on the surface about 20 minutes later just as the American astronauts completed their first walk Luna 15 finally began its descent but within minutes communications ceased the thinking is that it crashed into the side of a mountain Neil Armstrong called stepping on to the moon a giant leap for mankind but it's what he and other astronauts picked up that may turn out to be Apollo's greatest legacy on this and five subsequent missions the astronauts entered a world that's frozen in time in the absence of an atmosphere the rocks dirt and craters held evidence of events dating back nearly to the moon's birth meanwhile as they walked and rambled about scientists on earth were taking a fresh look at the lunar surface they noticed for example that some large old craters are surrounded by concentric rings you can see them in this image of a feature called the Moray Orion telling captured recently by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter the colors show differences in elevation scientists began to suspect that the Rings were created when an impactor splashed down on a local surface that gave rise to the notion that early in its history the moon's surface was a vast ocean of magma when the astronauts arrived they found relatively light rocks strewn about the surface they could have been forced to the surface by heavier material that had sunk toward the moon's interior the rocks contained another important clue to the moon's origins they were found to be strikingly similar to those on earth in part because they share forms of oxygen that scientists regard as blood types for solar system bodies a striking new theory emerged to explain the evidence early in the history of the solar system the theory holds Earth's shared an orbit with a mars-sized body called fan named for a Titan in Greek myth who gave birth to the moon goddess Cellini when its orbit became unstable it headed in earth's direction thia hit at an oblique angle causing the earth to spin faster and debris from both Thea and the earth to fly into orbit when the dust settled the debris began to coalesce in Earth orbit forming the moon by then volatile compounds like water had evaporated the moon then comes primarily from the mantles of the Earth and Theia that's why on the whole it's lighter or less dense than Earth from this violent beginning the moon gradually cooled and the magma that lined its surface hardened into a crust yet it was still subject to intense bombardment in the chaotic environment of the early solar system the Apollo astronauts encountered a secondary effect of all the impacts rocks that were formed in the crucible of widespread volcanism on earth volcanic eruptions are often powered by water heated and pressurized during the movement of immense tectonic plates volcanism on the moon is tied to impacts forceful enough to melt the surface and release material from the hot interior when this happened molten rock flowed out in thin smooth layers that reached far from its source that's how the Mari regions that cover about one-sixth of the entire lunar surface are thought to a form these immense volcanic basins date back to a period of large and violent impacts from three to four billion years ago it now appears that impacts had made an even deeper impression one new study seeks to explain the moon's lopsided topography the dark lava basins on the near side and the highlands on the far side it holds that another much smaller body formed alongside the room at the time of its birth and the vendor who merged with it the violence of the merger literally rearranged the moon's interior pushing molten magma on to the near side while adding an extra layer of crust to the farside Apollo astronauts took the first step in studying the interior of the moon by installing a network of seismographs scientists recently followed up by performing a kind of cat scan of the moon they sent out a pair of spacecraft called Grail to orbit the moon in unison by measuring subtle changes in the distance between the craft scientists can discern variations in the moon's gravity what they found was that the moon's gravity is not smooth rather it's pocked with regions that exert an especially strong pull Grail scientists have now linked these regions to dense concentrations of mass deep inside the moon and these two large impact sites such as the Mari oriental lunar impacts appear to have left an even more remarkable legacy in the year 2009 the L cross probe arrived at the moon aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on a collision course with the South Pole it slammed into a crater seconds later a trailing probe detected a tenuous cloud rising up from the crash site readings of this cloud showed that 5.6 percent of the crater floor consists of water ice most likely it was delivered by comets that crashed into the moon it had survived over the eons and craters with steep sides that shielded from the Sun it turns out that maybe just the beginning of vast hidden stores of water circling moon repeatedly aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter a russian-made instrument called lend has found evidence that hydrogen and perhaps water ice is embedded in lunar soils beyond the polar craters and now rocks picked up by the astronauts are telling an even deeper story analyzing them with new techniques several teams of scientists recently found a compound called hydroxyl it's h2o but with only one atom of hydrogen based on this evidence scientists estimate there is enough water locked up inside the moon to cover its surface in a layer one meter deep the intimate connection between the Earth and the moon appears to trace back to their earliest times so far we've really only scratched the surface of their shared history the quest to understand that relationship was once part of the feverish competition of the Cold War a whole new race to the moon is now heating up this time fueled by the search for valuable minerals and metals mining and money Russia the United States China India and Japan all had missions and development including an array of manned missions a number of private missions are also on the drawing boards what will these missions tell us about our celestial partner and how it formed inevitably the more we learn about the mysterious birth of the moon the more we'll learn about its mother planet Earth you
moonlanding,One of the most detailed tours of the ISS from American astronaut Steven Swanson!!!,ONE OF THE MOST DETAILED ISS TOUR!!!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvTmdIhYnes,0,3630194,46893,1962,19052,QvTmdIhYnes,"Hey, Sup Don We gon make it right? This is work Camera guy: This is the whole tour, start and finish right here. So, I'm on my computer No hands Camery guy: You have hands No feet It's roomie Alright, welcome to the international space station Here's a tour We're starting right now in Columbus And if you look on this little iPad right here there's a picture of the station And right here, that's Columbus so we're on the starboard side front area in that module right there As you can see it's the European laboratory but it's not just European we also have NASA racks in here, NASA payloads in here too at the same time. There's actually quite new stuff over here. This is the EML? (not sure) Alex'll have to tell you about that cause that's his But it's actually really cool because it talks about because it talks about magnetic limitation and I just think that's a cool sounding thing I don't know exactly what it's gonna do but it sounds great to me. Over here you can, it's hard to see, again, everything but we are growing the ah In here that's where we grew the lettuce, it's right in there. Farther, just a work bench storage area, there's a storage area above me storage area bellow me over here. This is where we take our blood, get it all set up for doing that. All the stuff is really neat for that all around here It's a pretty easy task. We even have a centrifuge we put the blood into to help process it. Then after we do that for 30 minutes we freeze it get it all cold and then we ship it to ground and hopefully they can tell something about it, when we get there Again, more storage over here and also the Ultrasound we hooked up right here. We do Ultrasounds of all sorts of the parts of our body. Make sure we're still doing okay. And then ah There's also in here the slam d which we don't want to set up but that's where we do the ah, measure our mass That's to see if we are loosing or gaining weight. Again, there's a lot of science actually going on here too that we don't touch too much, that we just set up. It's a good place, it's going pretty well and this is Alex's, you can tell this is ah the German flag in the back it's a good place for Alex. Moving on in Node 2 Camera man: The vacuum cleaner Yes that's true. We do have one of the most important pieces of equipment on the ISS hidden up here This is the vacuum cleaner. We say, NASA's talk is that this is the only piece of equipment that doesn't suck on International Space Station. But, actually this is much better than the old one so we actually like it and ah, it's nothing too fancy, just a vacuum cleaner. but we have to use it every week to get stuff clean Come into Node 2 and if you look on the picture here Node 2 is this section right here it's this front little piece that fits on that station so it's actually where the shuttle used to front and this black part is where the shuttle used to dock to and so right now, nothing of course is docking to that but we are in this area right after there It's called Node 2 If you look out here, this is where the shuttle actually docks just right through that hatch right that way and there's still a device on Earth a module called PMA that... (sorry can't hear it) and when we get a visiting vehicle such as the Cygnus or a Space X (manufacturing company) we avert it down here on the near side, the lower side we will open that hatch and we have that there. That's the idea of being a Node, it has multiple spots to attach to so you have all four sections here around and the one on the front and actually one behind us so there's actually six places to dock. Beside's that, it's really our ah work bench area and our living quarters in Node 2 Come this way. Actually I see over here another one of our work benches we usually keep both work benches, here and here but this time we have one the Columbus Module just cause Alex is working on a special project there. And then if you go back you'll see now it's coming into view the four crew quarters around here. So we have four of us this one's mine over here We have Oleg/Alek (Artemyev/Skvortsov?), we have Tonto we have Alex's It's kind of interest because once you get into one you really can't tell which one's which orientation you are so if I happened to go in to Tonto's to look at a picture, something he's got on his screen I'll come out and I'll be kinda confused because I don't know which way I'm going. Especially if you go into Alex's you come out and your really confused because it feels like your in your own but when you come out it's a totally different orientation. (speaking really fast and not clearly) If you look in here these aren't too big at all. You can take a quick look and I'll jump in here real quick So we have our sleeping bag attached to the wall. The way I like to do it is I just have it attached here at one point and one point up here so I can put my feet right up here when I'm sleeping and I kind of do it in the sense of this position like this and I'm kind of curled up a little bit in a semi on my side sleeping position which is what I like to do back on Earth and I works out pretty well, gives me that same feeling almost, but it works well for me. Then when you wake up in the morning the first thing you see is your laptops. I got one that connects to the internet which works like 50% of the time and then I've got another one that does the our lan*? which gives us our schedule, all the other information or email everything we need to do to work up here, that's what that one does. We also have an iPad as you can see and tht's also a I know it's small but really it works out well for me, we didn't need much more room up here So let's now move on to the lab And again if you look up here... so what we're doing right now, it's we are heading towards the back if we go to the port side now you can see that on your the port side is called node 3, and again it's very similar to ahhh node 1 and 2 and it's not even on this picture so that just makes it more difficult! but I might even have another one it shows... but it doesn't matter, it's to the ahh port side Cameraman: blame the guy who downloaded the picture yeah...blame the guy who downloaded the picture exactly which you normally don't have Let's go on back. We're gonna do, we're gonna head to the gym, 'cause we missed that at the beginning. So, we'll head there. And then we have finished up the USOS segment And on the way I'm gonna get some water 'cause I'm really dead thirsty. And I'll show you how we put water either for drink bags or for if we need to rehydrate some food. it's either gonna be room temperature water or  it's hot water. This is the location Now the PWD, portable water dispensible dispenser potable water dispenser I knew that, well it's probably portable too not that good so you just put whatever it is into the adapter how much water you want and hit the button it's pretty easy, even I can do it Now if you do want some cold stuff we have this where we look at them and we have stuff in there our main sauce right there is Sriracha and we live out of that, nice diet that makes everything taste better It's done. Fills up. And, uh,  the nice thing about these things, these straws of course it's got a little clamp on there so if I didn't have that on there I show you the water pressure, it just starts coming on out There you go. Let's go in to the gym. I'm going back actually right now back to node 2"

grandest achievement in all of mankind's history mere moments away does is filming from the LEM window and dull turn it the lighting is just horrid no worries mate just add more light so we can all see Neil even better hmmm it's still a little dark let's add some more nevermind Neil is completely in the shadow of the lamb and we're told the Sun provided the only light during the moon missions but clearly you can see Neil is being lit up from a second maybe even a third source of light even those of you who are thinking buzz was opening the I had the ability to open the aperture of the camera well how would he know that without Huston telling him Neil is talking to Houston at this time and we're all waiting for Neil to utter those famous words yet there's never any mention of in any official NASA transcripts of the need to adjust the lighting anyone who knows anything about the moon landings knows that the two astronauts climbed out of the LEM and then proceeded to deploy the US flag together it was ceremonial and it was well documented that that was the process mission after mission well funny thing here's the picture we're told Neil took as Buzz began to descend the ladder for his very first time to step on the moon and wouldn't you know it if you look closely at the LEM window here you can see something very familiar in the windows reflection can't quite see it no problem let me increase the gamma brightness here so you can make it out better in these two images clearly show that the flag has been deployed how her buzz has not come down the ladder at this point and the video shows that both astronauts place the flag together multiple takes to do each scene are very present throughout the photographic record of Apollo more on multiple takes involving the flag later in this episode back to Buzz here's a shot Neil took of him as he continued to descend the ladder zoom in on the photo and something very peculiar will jump off the screen at you one of the stagehands forgot to attach buzzes glove to his suit you can see the red ring where the glove is supposed to attach to the gauntlet of the suit a close look at buzzes gloves as he comes down the ladder a matching pair with a dark rubberized coating and a very distinctive Nvidia Sheen quote-unquote on the right are the gloves for the famous photo of man on the moon lighter not matching and no shimmer even in direct sunlight buzz cannot change gloves in the vacuum of space and a second pair were not supplied with their spaces at the top is an image of the glove and how it connects to the base of the gauntlet however as buzz comes down the ladder the red ring is visible that connects the glove and the suit the gloves are clearly not connected to the suit perhaps to help keep them cool during the simulated filming here are a couple of additional photos to show you how high up the glove attaches to the suit that buzzes arm sure got cold there in the freezing vacuum of space Apollo 11 showing assorted items rocks and car parts under the LEM take note of these items along the shadow line on the left here on the photo on the right the shadow does not have anything on the ground the set obviously has been redressed for the next photo shoot the landing drug has been straightened as well to really provide some damaging evidence that multiple scene techs were conducted to get it right before the world was shown all of this footage take a look at the footage provided to us by NASA after Neil and Buzz had ascended the ladder back into the lamp for the final time notice first real quickly the date here on the color plate July 11 1969 you NASA fan should know the official dates of the Apollo 11 mission right well if not here you go okay as this version of Neil and Buzz shows they left the flag pointing almost straight at the Sun and then climbed into the LEM launch from the surface never to touch the moon again but in this video there is a different version of the same events I want to point out a few things first check out the double shadow from the LEM indicating multiple light sources strike one and then as the camera pans to the right to reveal the flag take a note of which direction the flag now is pointing strike two now the camera will pan back to the left and you'll see the double shadow again but then they cut the video and start again and this time the double shadow has been eliminated strike three again keep in mind that Neil and Buzz did not get back out after ascending into the LEM getting ready to launch and rendezvous with a command module that's three strikes NASA and year-out in 2015 NASA released more than 8400 high-resolution images on Flickr claiming it was every photo taken by the astronauts during the six moon missions from 1969 to 1972 what you were about to see is the result of more than 10,000 hours of research poring over every photo every video every mission log everything available online relating to NASA's alleged six lunar landings the tireless researchers name is mr. Scott Henderson and he's been gracious enough to share his findings with us all before we begin if you already questioned whether the moon landings actually took place this and the subsequent videos will be the nail in the coffin if however you believe the moon missions did take place just like we've all been told this video series is going to significantly shake your confidence in that belief mr. Henderson has created plates of photos and diagrams and included his commentary to go along with each which I will read so let's begin we'll start with one of the most if not the most damaging evidence that the moon missions were not shot on the moon but right here on earth this is a close-up of the Apollo 17 flag we've all been told that there's no atmosphere on the moon and therefore there could not be any moisture right then why is the flag wet you can see it is drying from the edges in additional photos in this series will reveal other areas of moisture and even standing water the Apollo 11 LEM is on the left side and the Apollo 15 version on the right the helium tank has been removed not repositioned to accommodate the rover on the descent stage of the LEM the helium tank was used to pressurize the fuel to deliver it to the descent engine without the helium tank the engine will not run and any change in equipment would require the entire machine to be rebalanced as well a display model or prob forest for a stage set can easily be modified to fit the needs of the filming being done further there is no evidence that the engine has been fired in any of the videos or pictures the lack of visible exhaust or heat waves crater or scorching the paint on the exhaust bellhousing as well as the lack of moon dirt on the footpads is the same for all six of the missions and where the descent stage has a helium tank or not makes no difference where the engine and is capable of running or not makes no difference Apollo 16 cuff checklist the checklists are prepared months before launch however the information contained in them is impossible for NASA to know in advance how could NASA know the size shape exact location of a rock the exact time the astronauts would arrive at it the camera settings position to the Sun were the footprints and the disturbed area would be located how could NASA know the mineral composition of the inside of Iraq before it is split open on the lower left all SEP in past tense the checklists are storyboards and cue cards used for filming the scenes the astronauts when wearing the suits could not hear instructions from the film crew and the helmets would restrict their vision so the cuff checklists were used in Apollo 12 to 17 Apollo 11 did not have these lists Apollo 17 checklist contains impossible details locating four craters to drive through and around this is a very well staged scene one astronaut operating two cameras and taking photos at the same time Jones is the inspector for the filming and his location of where he is standing is clearly marked so what is he doing on the moon well they had to make sure Jones wasn't in the shot it's a director's note Jones was the inspector of the simulation video shot weeks before takeoff and this is the same video that NASA claims was taken on the moon this is the plate at the start of the video showing the date it was shot November 28th 1972 and of course Jones was never a crew member note the dates of the Apollo 17 mission however December 7 through 19 1972 but the video was shot November 28th of them on the moon more than a week earlier in our next video mr. Henderson shows evidence that the Apollo 15 LEM was dropped during the videoing of its landing and damaged significantly will cover the repairs required before the astronauts could be filmed next to the LEM the Apollo 15 lamb was dropped during the videoing of its landing and damaged significantly I've slowed down the video here so you can see the damage the LEM suffers because of this staged mishap two damaged PLSS lie on the ground but only two were supplied for the mission according to NASA so by simple deduction here the astronaut taking the picture undoubtedly must have one on and the astronaut in the background must also have one on so in actuality I guess there were four on Apollo 15 the main strut is not centered on a landing pad as a result of the crash landing and you can see the ball joint has been broken secondary struts were broken off the ball swivel joints had to be replaced photographs could not be taken outside of the LEM until the damage was repaired to avoid this an se VA and to Evie A's were done before the flag and photos around the limb or shown there were no shots or video the first steps of the Apollo 15 astronauts on the lunar surface the photos here are almost shot at the same angle showing the damage to the exhaust housing that happened as a result of the crash of Apollo 15 on the left however the photo on the right is from Apollo 17 it is the same equipment and the damage has not been repaired only the Apollo 15 legs were worked on to lift it off the ground okay back to the PLSS 'as you can see the cover is removed the only function it had was to cool the suit just the sublimator canisters on the left is a display model of what should be inside the PLSS the arrows are pointing to the top core and the cannister when the Apollo 15 LEM was dropped during the simulated landing equipment was damaged and the rover was broken from its mounts the exhaust housing was crushed as you can see here the lowering arms for the rover are broken on the ground and all the ropes are broken the rover was damaged as well as we'll see clearly in the next episode in this series note the mold growing on the sewage bag another example of equipment being recycled for each mission and Ageing over time on the lower right of this photo is more damaged and broken parts the pink foam above the legs on the flat surface between the descent and ascent modules the astronauts in their moon suits did not have the ability to get to that location and considering that the astronauts event have not been anywhere near the LEM since landing riding around on the rover for two EVs the activity under and around the LEM was caused by repair crews not them they quickly raked the soil to cover the footprints and broken parts were thrown under the LEM not even removed from the set here again is a close-up of the Apollo 17 flag drying from the edges in a stark reminder that the Apollo missions were shot right here on earth not the lunar surface in which no moisture could ever be present based on how the moon is presented to us by NASA you'll continue to see as you make your way through these Apollo videos that the evidence is there on how the equipment and the props were recycled mission after mission on the moon stage set and shot over a period of time that resulted in the obvious aging weathering and breaking down of many items so let's proceed these are the three Apollo 17 Rovers that's right three different Rovers in Apollo 17 look closely at the right rear fender which identifies the differences in each the seat and floor have tools and replacement parts that were not onboard the lam the payload specialist main function was to reduce the weight of the vehicle even counting every stitch in their suits to bring the weight down there was no contingency for repairs as a result of the crash landing in Apollo 15 which we covered in a previous episode the rover was damaged note the painted rims and the damage to the rear fender the missing fender and painted rims here the fender has fallen off of the rover and Apollo 16 on the Left nothing was done to fix it between the two mission filming's so the astronauts mounted a map to the fender in Apollo 17 to stop the dirt from flying up at them this is just another example of the same equipment being used for all of the missions the Apollo 15 Rover has broken down and Apollo 16 the front steering rods have fallen down the astronauts drove the rover backwards as can be seen in magazine 117 from 187 33 for the next 70 or more pictures the direction of the tire tread shows that clearly the video of this Traverse shows the rover moving forward however that means nASA has presented the video to us in Reverse they're playing in backwards the same rover from Apollo 15 was used in Apollo 16 the front steering broke and the only way to drive it was backwards so the wheels casted like a shopping cart the tire tracks confirmed the direction if they were driving back over their own tracks the pattern would be the opposite of what is shown Apollo 15 16 and 17 the same Rover was used one of the features and identifies this is the oil leak in the rear axle on the left side the LEM was dropped remember during this simulated landing damaging the rover and Apollo 15 the fenders and steering are the most notable this rover continued to have problems and breakdowns during filming Apollo 16 has two Rovers and Apollo 17 apparently at 3 they can be identified by comparing the frame rails and tire tracks this is the second Rover in Apollo 16 used only for this photo shoot the jump salute it is distinctive and is the only Rover to have the front left fender with a double rib all other pictures of a rover from all the missions have a single rib like the front right fender the upper images are of the lower frame rails of the Apollo 17 Rovers all are very different in design just in front of the right rear wheel three different tire tracks found in Apollo 17 while waiting for Aldrin to come down the ladder Armstrong took this photo on the top right is an air intake louver and on the bottom is an air intake housing where an air filter goes the center bolt and washer is visible and it has a handle on the intake horn as well the objects on the ground are automotive in nature looking at the mesh of material behind aldrin I am surprised that they didn't trip and fall on the bottom right there is a car alternator and below some bent metal parts the surveyor is a quickly put together prob the solar array is just a wooden board and they are not even the same and the lower right shows standing water and the coating is peeling back NASA wants you to believe that this thing navigated to the moon descended landed and sent back pictures scooped up dirt analyzed it and sent back data if so where is the high-gain antenna NASA's Genesis rock location it appears the interior of one rock was soft enough to be kicked apart with a boot inside the rock were metal parts this broken rock revealed two spark plugs a champion left and an AC Delco right any motor mechanic would recognize them as discussed in our previous episode the rover broke down the front steering arms were left on the ground and beside it is a golf ball but Apollo 14 was the only mission that claimed to feature golf balls and this is not the only ball in Apollo 17 on close examination there are many other golf balls present in this photo the only reflection from the CSM should be the blackness of space this indoor simulation of the CSM is for dramatic effect showing the moon however the CSM was never in a lower orbit before the lab two doors are clearly visible and on the right there are three men in the reflection two are facing to the left and the other is facing the camera lighting in consistencies our parent as well the EBA suits worn by the astronauts had a sunglasses pocket all six missions had the same pocket it is however impossible to put sunglasses on during an Eevee a in the vacuum of space NASA had payload specialists to reduce the weight in NASA claims that they were so detailed at every stitch in their suits or counted to reduce the payload as much as possible however if you were faking it here on earth sunglasses would come in handy after taking off a helmet with a gold sunscreen in the visor the astronauts were Superstars and had to look as cool as James Dean the crews must have started working early in the morning and then had to wait for the mist declare the astronauts were kind enough to take a couple of photos to record the event the result of wet lunar dust in the image on the Left astronauts Erna has picked up a little dust turned mud and so that has gotten to his spacesuit especially the left arm and the glove of his suit in the right photo just two frames later the wetland or soil has been washed off on the moon to confirm this the suit is still physically wet on his left arm and glove NASA claims this photo was taken in space during an undocking procedure it is clear to see however that water is drying from this panel this window was blown out during a pressure test it was taped back in and a rain guard broken in this photo was installed to try and keep the water out NASA claims this was taken halfway to the moon water is running down the window and zero-gravity and water is in between the layers of glass which means the seal is broken and water does not freeze on the glass even though it's minus 250 degrees outside note that the water is causing the paint to peel between the layers of glass all SEP removal from the lab the poor condition of this piece of equipment is unmistakable it appears to have been exposed to water resulting in mold growth and consequently is very badly soiled remember the equipment we were told was prepared under ultra clean conditions before the mission the deterioration of this item must be intentional to draw attention to the simulation these two photos are examples of equipment left outside to weather NASA is using the same props until it is in such bad shape it has to be replaced all of the experimental package ages over time permission to the next on the left is standing water and mud is left after water has evaporated on the right cracks are visible and a plastic is curling up in our next episode mr. Henderson niala presented photographic evidence this is at the stage crew intentionally left clues for all of us to find later as they became more and more frustrated with their role in the greatest hoax ever pulled on the world so stay tuned oh and one more thing when filming a fake moon landing make sure when you are making observations that you appear to be enthusiastic just like this cuff checklist says these two rocks were on the left side of the large rock Tracy's rock then in magazine one four six the rocks are on the right and one photo later are missing altogether this shows how NASA can manipulate a set the ground on the left side of the rock has been brought back into pristine condition after the rocks were moved speaking of rocks this is an example of how some of the rocks were made for the moon set one of the features this rock has is its color unlike the other rocks and the photos the wire mesh is covered with a plaster type coating didn't turn out well for NASA so there's only a few of these rocks and only in Apollo 15 did the rocks look like this the prop rock exteriors were coated to make them appear to be real rocks this rock was turned over to reveal how it was formed it appears to have a lunar dust coating the dust can be scraped away as pointed out here with the tool a real rock would need to be split open to reveal a flat surface examples of how rocks were produced for the set remember the many automotive parts in our previous videos it looked like real rocks but objects such as automotive parts may be found inside the one above appears to be like an ignition coil note the steel band a wrapped around the case with square nuts be facing the camera this very distinctive rock has been used in more than one mission indicating that the same location was used to stage the Apollo moon landings if you don't immediately recognize that distinctive folds on the corners of this rock it's the prop see rock found in Apollo 16 Penn & Teller addressed this prop rock on one of their TV shows no surprise then that it has magically reappeared in an earlier Apollo mission a photograph perhaps we can see now why the image creators drew attention to it GC nASA has tried to get rid of the C prop rock but it's not the only one with lettering on it this bag is from a golf course the GC on the bottom means that this is a rental golf bag perhaps Major Tom was using it on the moon and then the GC he would stand for ground control this one will open NASA's eyes hope their eyelashes don't start falling out the grasping tongs are carefully placed so the shadow makes an arrow the white glove with rubber tips is at the end of the arrow to the left of that glove are many more gloves with the fingers sticking straight out of this dirt pile the astronauts must have had fun staging this easily taken to be a small rock in the background this close-up reveals it contains what appears to be an upper part of a half-buried Labatt beer cannon this Canadian Labatt label design is a very close match to the one in the 1970s photo the LEM landing gear were built by hero aerospace of Quebec Canada the crews that worked on building and dressing these sets really were whistleblowers a double shadow of this size would have to take some very powerful studio lighting from two light sources alternatively these images have been retouched it is better to have it in writing and to swear in a Bible this BS statement is from the disgruntled employees of the Apollo 12 stage crew we've all written in the sand or dirt before right in case you weren't aware the back panels of the ascent stage were nearly blown off when the explosive bolts were set off that were meant to separate the Apollo 16 ascent stage from the descent stage as seen here in this official NASA footage of the liftoff from the moon surface watch closely and you can see the back panels rippling like pieces of fabric as the ascent stage rose out of sight here is the same video slowed down so you can really see the panel's rippling as they are nearly blown off and finally here is that same video again slowed down and magnified NASA didn't hide this fact either here are two photos allegedly snapped by command module pilot Thomas K Mattingly the second as the ascent stage prepared to rendezvous with the CSM clearly the blast is strong enough to nearly blow the panel's completely off the side of the spacecraft would have disabled the craft if it were a real takeoff this fact alone provides damaging evidence that it was simply a staged event and the ascent stage was lifted by cables as there is no exhaust just the explosive bolts going off in the side of the spacecraft being blown out further there were no comments from either NASA nor the two astronauts John Young Charles Duke about the explosion they were just reading from the script here's the audio from the official NASA video and the mission transcript itself the land we are told was a very thin-skinned lightweight machine if it encountered any kind of explosion especially one of this magnitude it would have caused a rupture of the hole in the vacuum of space and resulted in a catastrophic failure what is behind those panels you may ask well here's a photo of the lander taken prior to the mission here on earth to show all the wiring electrical components and mission-critical mechanisms located directly behind the panels that were subject to this explosion in this photo of the Apollo 16 LEM taken by one of the astronauts before liftoff you can see the explosive pack behind the panels when magnified this is further illustrated when you compare the Apollo 17 panels to that of the Apollo 16 version it's clear the panel's were either replaced or simply reused again after a fresh coat of paint had been applied to the ones that were nearly blown off as we've demonstrated throughout this Apollo series equipment was reused and recycled mission after mission on the moon stage set"
moonlanding,"The episode of Cosmic Journeys explores the intersection of paleoclimate and current climate science. Through its turbulent history, Antarctica has played an important role in the evolution of planet Earth. This role will likely continue as a warming global climate begins to eat away at the ice sheets that cover the continent. The fate of the world as we know it is linked to the fate of  Antarctica.",Cosmic Journeys - Fate of Antarctica,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oA1sphuyazY,0,280374,2028,155,339,oA1sphuyazY,"It�s a land piled high with ice. Whipped by fierce winds. And powerful ocean currents. In a world buffeted by rising temperatures,
 rising sea levels, and changing climate patterns, what is the fate of Antarctica? If you could go back to a time 250 million
 years ago. What�s now the frozen continent of Antarctica,
 was a land of forests and flowing water. In a warmer, wetter world, it harbored a wide
 diversity of plants and animals. In this period, known as the Permian, Antarctica
 was at the southern end of a vast single continent that spanned the globe, called Pangaea. Within the sweeping evolution of this grand
 continent, a single event would reverberate down through history. An asteroid headed toward the southern hemisphere. At up to fifty kilometers in diameter, it
 would have been four to five times larger than the one thought to have killed off the
 dinosaurs. It crashed into a region that�s now part
 of East Antarctica, but its impact was global in scale. One theory is that it sent powerful seismic
 waves to the exact opposite, or antipodal, side of the Earth. On what�s now Siberian Russia, a plume of
 magma pushed up through Earth�s crust. For tens of thousands of years, lava flooded the
 landscape. A release of toxic elements, a rush of carbon
 dioxide into the atmosphere, acid rain, all led to one of the worst mass extinctions in
 history. 70% of all species on the planet vanished. On Earth, traces of most major impacts are
 obscured by erosion or geological activity. A new type of observational tool is now allowing
 scientists to see them. In 2002, they launched the twin spacecraft
 of the GRACE mission, short for Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory. Its goal was to map subsurface features by
 measuring variations in Earth�s gravity. A gravitational surge or a dip causes the
 distance between the two craft to change, which GRACE measures down to the width of
 a human hair. Down along the Eastern part of Antarctica,
 GRACE detected an immense subsurface presence. Scientists matched it up with subtle rings
 etched on the wider landscape, and with chemical traces found in nearby mountains. They concluded
 that a large meteor had struck at the end of the Permian. It would have a lasting impact on Antarctica�s
 long and tumultuous journey. That journey began in the break up of an immense
 continent known as Rodinia, beginning around 750 million years ago. In those days, Antarctica basked in the tropical
 sun. Some 300 million years later, as Earth�s
 landmasses reshuffled into the supercontinent Pangaea. When Pangaea finally fragmented, Antarctica
 began a steady drive toward the southern pole as part of the great southern continent of
 Gondwana. At around 130 million years ago, a series
 of rifts developed in Earth�s crust, tearing South America and Africa away from Gondwana. Australia finally split off at about 85 million
 years ago, leaving Antarctica on its own. Because the rift between the two cuts through
 the Permian crater, one theory holds that the force of the impact may have actually
 initiated it. Now separated from its sister landmasses,
 Antarctica carried a rich biological legacy, evident in fossils recently pulled from the
 frozen ground. The Cryolophosaurus, from 190 million years
 ago, was in a class of meat eaters called theropods. These bipedal creatures gave rise to some
 of the fiercest predators ever, including TRex, as well as modern-day birds. Out on the West Antarctic Peninsula, scientists
 turned up a smaller theropod from 70 million years ago. This swift predator would have
 grown to about two meters in length. From the same period, another group found
 a young plesiosaur, a marine reptile that plied warm Southern Oceans. If it had reached adulthood, it would have
 grown to around 10 meters in length. From a continent that once hosted dinosaurs,
 Antarctica grew steadily more hostile to life. Wind the clock forward, to 50 million years
 ago. All around the world, warm conditions were
 giving way to cooler, drier times. The new era saw a decline in the heat-trapping
 atmospheric gas, carbon dioxide. Around Antarctica, conifers and other cold-tolerant
 plants took hold. In some areas, they gradually turned to tundra. Ice remained year round, gradually forming
 a thick sheet. At the same time, powerful wind currents circling
 the pole from west to east drove the circumpolar ocean current. Known as the mightiest current in the world,
 it helped shield the continent from tropical waters to the north. A combination of factors came together: declining
 CO2, the isolation of Antarctica, and the tendency of permanent ice stores to reflect
 more solar energy back to space. At around two and a half million years ago,
 Earth entered the last great ice age, the one we live in, called the Quaternary. Year after year, as storms rolled off the
 oceans, they deposited layer upon layer of snow and ice across Antarctica. Today, fully 70 percent of all the fresh water
 on the planet is here, in ice that averages nearly two kilometers in thickness. Antarctica today is known as the windiest,
 driest, and coldest place on Earth. There are no permanent human populations,
 only a few thousand scientists and support workers living at scattered research stations. At the Russian Vostok station, in July 1983,
 scientists documented the lowest natural temperature on record: -89.2 degrees Celsius. A recent calculation based on satellite data
 went even lower, to -93.2 degrees Celsius. But as cold and isolated as it is, Antarctica
 is not immune to changes in the larger environment. Take, for example, this reconstruction of
 the continent during the last glacial maximum, 20 thousand years ago. Compare it to this image of the current interglacial
 period. It shows how much ice the continent has shed. In recent years, the rate of ice loss has
 picked up speed. Scientists have turned to satellites to find
 out where and how quickly this trend is playing out. In these images, from the GRACE mission, areas
 that lost ice are shown in blue, while orange and red gained ice. European scientists backed up this finding
 with radar data from the Cryosat-2 spacecraft. By tracking changes in the elevation of Antarctic
 ice, they found that the continent lost on average 159 billion tons of ice each year
 from 2010 to 2013. That�s an increase of 31% per year over
 the previous five years. Like GRACE, Cryosat-2 found that the greatest
 losses have occurred in West Antarctica, especially where a series of fast-flowing glaciers empty
 into the Amundsen Sea. A small number of scientists were warning
 about this as far back as the 1960s. The reason, they pointed out, is the intensification
 of winds that encircle the continent. As the temperature difference with northern
 regions has increased, these winds have picked up speed. To sailors brave enough to venture into them,
 the southern ocean once offered the quickest route around the world. Nowadays, stronger winds have had the effect
 of drawing to the surface relatively warm water that occurs naturally in the depths
 of the ocean. These warmer waters have begun to undermine
 a series of vast floating ice shelves that extend out from inland glaciers. Scientists, using data from the IceSat spacecraft,
 documented this effect by correlating areas of greatest ice loss with the location of
 submarine troughs that can funnel the warm water up. These satellite images from over a decade
 ago show the effect this can have. Out on the West Antarctic Peninsula, the Larsen ice
 shelf extended out over the ocean. This image, from early February of 2002, shows
 Larsen beginning to splinter. By March 7th of that year, this ice shelf,
 hundreds of meters thick, broke apart. Countless icebergs tumbled into the sea. Without the shelf�s buttressing effect,
 the glaciers behind it picked up speed, dumping an additional 27 cubic kilometers of ice into
 the ocean each year. That has led scientists to monitor the other
 great ice shelves of west Antarctica. One team set up its base on the Pine Island
 Glacier, where it juts out into the Amundsen Sea. From the surface, they drilled down through
 500 meters of ice to track changes in temperature, salinity, currents, and ice volume. They found that warmer waters had been eroding
 the underside of the ice shelf, with melt rates of about 6 centimeters per day, or about
 22 meters per year. Another group has been using satellite and
 airborne radar to track the changes on a regional scale. Red shows where the glaciers are traveling
 at their highest speeds, at the intersection of ice and ocean. The flow speed is steadily increasing. The
 darker the red, the faster the ice is moving. Some of the most dramatic changes have been
 observed on the Smith glacier, one of the smallest in this group. Back in 1996, this is where water, ice, and
 land met beneath Smith. By 2011, that so-called �grounding line�
 had moved 35 kilometers farther back, a retreat of more than two kilometers per year. Now peel off the ice from the continent. The
 red arrows show the highest flow rates. You can see that these fast moving glaciers
 sit within valleys, some of which are below sea level. The more the grounding lines retreat, the
 more seawater can creep into the sub-glacial basins. For most of the glaciers, there are no major
 barriers such as hills or mountains that would slow them down once they get going. The danger is the more the glaciers speed
 up, the more likely the ice sheets behind them will collapse. If that happens, it may not be completely
 due to climate change. Scientists have found that the flow of water
 beneath some glaciers is too high to come just from seawater. The Transantarctic Mountains, dividing East
 and West Antarctica, are the product of a rift that is occurring in the underlying crustal
 plate. Scientists have detected seismic activity
 they say is consistent with magma moving within the crust over 25 kilometers down. They have now found there is a significant
 amount of geothermal activity beneath one of the largest glaciers, the Thwaites, to
 account for the extra melting. To date, most studies of future sea level
 rise have focused on the ice sheets of Greenland and Western Antarctica. Together, they would
 account for up to 12 meters of sea level rise. The massive East Antarctic ice sheet has been
 largely ignored. Because of its sheer size and unwavering cold, it has seemed impervious
 to warming trends in the north. New research has given scientists reason to
 wonder how stable it really is. One new study takes us back to a period called
 the Pliocene, from about 5 to 2.5 million years ago. Back then, global temperatures
 and atmospheric CO2 concentrations were about where they are projected to be at the end
 of this century. Sea levels are thought to have been at least
 20 meters higher than today. If any part of East Antarctica had melted,
 it would have been here in a region called Wilkes Land. This is where the GRACE satellites detected
 signs of the massive Permian impact. If the 
 glaciers of Wilkes Land are prone to melting in warmer times, then erosion would have washed
 its distinctive volcanic soils into the sea. By drilling down into ocean sediments, scientists
 were able to find them just off shore. They concluded that in the Pliocene, seawater
 was able to erode rocks about 160 kilometers inland in an area called the Wilkes Sub-glacial
 Basin. How stable is the Wilkes ice sheet today? Currently, it is said to be in balance. This
 means the amount of ice that melts or falls into the sea is replaced by new ice that forms
 inland. Scientists used a computer simulation to find
 out what it would take to throw Wilkes out of balance. A crucial factor in their calculation is a
 zone in which the ice shelf is wedged against a series of ridges on the sea bottom. These
 ridges act as a stopper, preventing the glacier, and the ice sheet behind it, from moving forward. If warmer waters were to undermine the ice
 that rests on these ridges, then the ice sheet could begin to move out to sea. The effect has been described as that of a
 bottle of water tilted downward. Remove the stopper, and gravity empties it out. For a glacier, once the ice starts flowing,
 there would be no stopping it. How plausible is this scenario? On the much smaller Pine Island glacier, scientists
 have shown that the ice shelf has already broken free of an undersea ridge. The disintegration of coastal Antarctic glaciers
 is a process that would take centuries to run its course. But once it gets going, it
 would mean a steady rise of sea levels for the foreseeable future. The changes we experience in our everyday
 lives are shaped mostly by near-term developments, in technology, politics, and culture. Some of the bedrocks of modern life, cities
 like New York, Hong Kong, London, and seaports around the world, have grown and evolved on
 the scale of centuries. Within the long arc of their histories, rising
 seas could threaten their existence in a relatively short time frame. The emerging story of ice sheet melting and
 sea level rise is often couched in uncertainties, with the drama of what�s happening damped
 by the rational language of science. Critics focus on the margins of error inherent
 in the scientific process, or downplay the predictive power of computer simulations. Politicians debate, while conspiracy theories
 abound. One of the lessons of Antarctica is that our
 choices are beginning to narrow. The trends we see now will increasingly shape the fate
 of Antarctica, and that of the world we know. 3"
moonlanding,"During a July 24 science update at NASA headquarters, new surprising imagery and science results were revealed from the recent flyby of Pluto, by the New Horizons spacecraft. These included an image from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager or (LORRI) – looking back at Pluto – hours after the historic flyby that shows haze in the planet’s sunlit atmosphere, that extends as high as 80 miles above Pluto’s surface – much higher than expected. Models suggest that the hazes form when ultraviolet sunlight breaks apart methane gas.
 
LORRI images also show evidence that exotic ices have flowed – and may still be flowing across Pluto’s surface, similar to glacial movement on Earth. This unpredicted sign of present-day geologic activity was detected in Sputnik Planum – an area in the western part of Pluto’s heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio.
 
Additionally, new compositional data from New Horizons’ Ralph instrument indicate that the center of Sputnik Planum is rich in nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and methane ices.",NASA’s New Horizons Team Reveals New Scientific Findings on Pluto,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWr29KIs2Ns,0,186497,1218,121,180,dWr29KIs2Ns,">>> GOOD AFTERNOON. WELCOME TO NASA HEADQUARTERS IN
 WASHINGTON. I'M WADE BROWN WITH THE OFFICE

 TEAM IS BACK TO REVEAL EVEN MORE UNPRECEDENTED IMAGES AND SCIENCE
 THAT CONTINUE TO BE RETURNED FROM THE NEW HORIZONS SPACECRAFT
 FOLLOWING ITS HISTORIC JULY 14th FLY BY PLUTO. LET'S SET THE STAGE FOR TODAY'S
 BRIEFING. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PODIUM
 ASTRONAUT AND HEAD OF THE NASA DIRECTORATE WHERE NEW HORIZONS
 IS ONE OF ALMOST 100 SCIENCE MISSIONS IN THE PORTFOLIO,
 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DR. JOHN
 GRUNGEFELD. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DUANE. AND, YOU KNOW, THIS WEEK HAS
 BEEN JUST A PHENOMENAL WEEK. ON MONDAY WE LEASED THE FIRST
 IMAGE FROM THE EPIC EARTH POLYCHROMATIC IMAGING PROGRAM ON
 THE DISCOVER MISSION, THE BLUE MARVEL. THIS IS OUR FIRST, YOU KNOW,
 TRUE BLUE MARVEL OF THE EARTH SINCE 1972 WHEN THE APOLLO 17
 ASTRONAUTS TOOK THE FAMOUS BLUE MARVEL IMAGE OF THE EARTH. IT REALLY PAINTS I THINK AN
 INCREDIBLE PICTURE OF OUR HOME PLANET AND HOW, YOU KNOW, LUCKY
 AND PRECIOUS PLANET EARTH IS. ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU COMPARE IT
 TO THE AMAZING VIEWS WE'VE RECENTLY GOTTEN FROM THE DAWN
 SPACECRAFT, YOU KNOW, WHICH IS A SOMEWHAT SERIOUS, HOSTILE WORLD
 TO EARTH PLANET SERIES. WE'VE JUST ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY A
 KEPPLER DISCOVERY OF SORT OF A PARALLEL, A COUSIN OF SOLAR
 SYSTEM TO THAT OF OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM WITH A G-TYPE STAR MUCH
 LIKE OUR SUN, A LITTLE BIT OLDER, AND AN EXOPLANET THAT'S
 ABOUT 60% BIGGER DIAMETER THAN THE EARTH RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF
 A HABITABLE ZONE. IT'S TRULY AMAZING THE THINGS
 THAT WE'RE DOING. BUT THE IMAGES THAT WE'VE BEEN
 GETTING AND THE SCIENCE WE'VE BEEN GETTING FROM PLUTO HAS
 REALLY JUST BEEN BEEN, YOU KNOW, MORE THAN AMAZING AND PROVES
 DEFINITIVELY A SCIENTIFIC THEORY THAT SCIENCE NEVER SLEEPS. AND IF YOU LOOK AT OUR PANEL
 HERE, THEY ACTUALLY LOOK PRETTY CHEERY FOR A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS
 THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SLEEPING FOR THE LAST FEW WEEKS. BUT THEY ARE HERE TO TELL US
 ABOUT THE MOST RECENT AMAZING RESULTS FROM THE PLUTO NEW
 HORIZONS MISSION. AND I'M JUST THRILLED TO BE HERE
 TO HEAR THOSE RESULTS. INTRODUCE OUR PANELISTS FOR THIS

 CO-INVESTIGATOR AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS. WITH THAT, I'LL TURN IT OVER TO
 JIM. >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, DUANE. YOU KNOW, JULY 14th WAS VERY
 HISTORIC FOR NASA WITH OUR VERY SUCCESSFUL FLYBY OF THE NEW
 HORIZONS SPACECRAFT NEAR THE PLUTO SYSTEM. AND WE'RE JUST TEN DAYS FROM
 THAT, AND YET WE'VE ONLY HAD ABOUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE
 ABOUT 5% OF THE DATA. AS MANY KNOW, WE STORED THAT
 DATA ON BOARD AS WE FLEW THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND IT'S JUST NOW
 STARTING TO COME BACK. EACH AND EVERY DAY THE SCIENCE
 TEAM HAS BEEN HUDDLED LOOKING AT THE DATA AS IT COMES BACK AND
 IT'S ALWAYS SURPRISED AND JUST QUITE A PLEASURE TO BE PART OF
 THAT TEAM, TO LOOK AT THE DATA WHEN IT COMES IN, AND SEE THE
 NEW DISCOVERIES THAT ARE COMING OUT. NOW, TODAY WE'RE GOING TO TALK
 ABOUT SOME OF THE LATEST DATA THAT CAME IN WITHIN THE LAST FEW
 DAYS. THIS IS A SPECTACULAR SET OF
 DATA, BUT IT'S ALSO DATA THAT HAPPENED AND WAS TAKEN ON BOARD,
 STORED PRIOR TO THE ENCOUNTER AND ITS POSTENCOUNTER, AFTER THE
 SPACECRAFT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO FLY THROUGH THE PLUTO SYSTEM AND
 LOOK BACK TO PLUTO AS IT'S HURTLING AWAY AT MORE THAN 16
 KILOMETERS PER SECOND. THESE ARE JUST AMAZING
 DISCOVERIES. SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO, ALLOW ME
 TO TURN IT OVER TO THE PRINCIPAL VOR, ALAN STERN, TO START IT
 OFF. ALAN? >> THANK YOU, JIM. AS JIM SAID, LAST WEEK THE
 UNITED STATES, THROUGH OUR PROJECT AND NASA, EXPLORED THE
 FARTHEST FRONTIER EVER EXPLORED BY HUMANKIND, THE PLUTO SYSTEM. WE CAN'T TELL YOU HOW HAPPY WE
 ARE TO BE BACK AS A TEAM AND TELL YOU WHAT WE'VE BEEN
 DISCOVERING. WE CAME BACK LAST FRIDAY TO GIVE
 A FIRST REPORT ABOUT FIRST REACTIONS TO DATA DOWNLOAD. TEN DAYS OUT, 7.5 MILLION MILES
 FROM PLUTO, WE'VE HAD MORE TIME TO THINK ABOUT THE DATA SETS
 THAT ARE ON THE GROUND AND EQUALLY IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE
 ABOUT THREE TIMES AS MUCH DATA ON THE GROUND. NOW, IT'S NOT VERY MUCH OF THE
 TOTAL DATA LOAD. WE HAVE ABOUT 4% TO 5% OF THE
 DATA BACK. 95% OR 96% OF IT IS STILL ON THE
 SPACECRAFT SO WE'RE ONLY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE AND WE
 HAVE SOME GREAT DISCOVERIES TO TELL YOU ABOUT. ALSO, THE SIZE OF THE DATA SETS,
 THERE'S ONE OTHER WAY ON THIS PROJECT TO KNOW THAT WE'VE DONE
 THE EXPLORATION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF PLUTO, AND THAT'S THIS
 BUMPER STICKER THAT'S INSPIRED BY VAL MALDER, OUR DEPUTY
 ASSISTANTS ENGINEER. IT SAYS, ""MY OTHER VEHICLE
 EXPLORED PLUTO."" A NICE PICTURE OF PLUTO MADE BY
 NEW HORIZONS IN THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR. THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW. I WANT TO SAY A FEW THINGS AND
 I'D LIKE TO CALL UP MY FIRST GRAPHIC, WHICH IS A HAUNTINGLY
 IMAGE OF THE DOUBLE PLANET SYSTEM PLUTO SHARING WITH PLUTO
 ON THE LEFT AND SHARON ON THE RIGHT. THIS IS MADE A FEW DAYS OUT ON
 APPROACH WITH TRUE COLOR ADDED FROM OUR RALPH INSTRUMENT ON TOP
 OF THE LURIE IMAGE. AS I TELL YOU ABOUT WHERE WE ARE
 IN THE MISSION, JUST FEAST YOUR EYES ON THIS. WE'VE NEVER BEEN TO A DOUBLE
 PLANET SYSTEM BEFORE, AND IT'S TURNING OUT TO BE A SCIENTIFIC
 WONDERLAND. WE'VE NOW FINISHED THE FIRST
 PHASE OF DOWNLINK. THAT WAS AN INTENSIVE TEN-DAY
 PERIOD IN WHICH WE SENT DOWN IMAGES AND SPECTRA AND OTHER
 DATA SETS JUST TO WHET OUR APPETITES AND TELL US THE BASICS
 ABOUT THE PLUTO SYSTEM AND THE DISCOVEIES YOU'LL BE HEARING
 ABOUT BY MYSELF AND MIKE, KATHY, AND BILL REPORT ON SOME OF THE
 MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGS THAT WE'VE ALREADY MADE IN THESE FEW
 DAYS. WE'RE NOW MOVING INTO A SECOND
 PHASE OF DOWNLINK. IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT, AND
 I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE UNDERSTAND THAT
 DIFFERENCE. WE'LL BE TRANSMITTING HOME NOW A
 LOT OF ENGINEERING DATA FROM THE FLYBY AS WELL AS DAY DATA FROM
 OUR PLASMA, OUR STUDENT COUNTER AND HEADER DATA TO GO WITH THE
 IMAGES AND SPECTER WE'VE ALREADY GOT. SO FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF
 MONTHS, UNTIL WE REACH MID-SEPTEMBER, IT WILL ONLY BE
 OCCASIONALLY THAT WE'LL HAVE NEW IMAGES ON THE GROUND AND
 AVAILABLE TO RELEASE. BUT STARTING IN SEPTEMBER, THE
 SPIGOT OPENS AGAIN, AND THEN FOR ABOUT A YEAR, MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
 MORE, THE SKY WILL BE RAINING PRESENTS WITH DATA FROM THE
 PLUTO SYSTEM. IT'S GOING TO BE QUITE A RIDE. WE'RE REALLY HAPPY ABOUT THE
 AMOUNT OF INTEREST IN THIS MISSION AS A MISSION TEAM. WE'RE EXCITED TO SHARE IT WITH
 ALL OF YOU. AND WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME OF
 THAT RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GOING GET RIGHT INTO THE
 SCIENCE. FOR SOME OF YOU, IF YOU'RE
 SEEING A CARDIOLOGIST YOU MAY WANT TO LEAVE THE ROOM. THERE ARE SOME PRETTY MIND
 PLEAU -BLOWING DISCOVERIES I'M GOING
 TO TALK ABOUT. MY SECOND GRAPHIC, OUR 2 X 2
 MOSAIC OF THE PLUTO SYSTEM. THIS HAS TWICE THE RESOLUTION OF
 THE PREVIOUS BEST GLOBAL IMAGE OF THE APPROACH HEMISPHERE. AND REALLY IT'S JUST MOUTH
 WATERING. THE LEVEL OF DETAIL IS
 SPECTACULAR. THIS IMAGE HAS A RESOLUTION OF
 ABOUT 2.2 KILOMETERS PER PIXEL, AND I THINK JUST LOOKING AT IT,
 YOU CAN TELL AS OUR SCIENCE TEAM CAN, THAT PLUTO HAS A VERY
 COMPLICATED STORY TO TELL. PLUTO HAS A VERY INTERESTING
 HISTORY, AND THERE IS A LOT OF WORK THAT WE NEED TO DO TO
 UNDERSTAND THIS VERY COMPLICATED PLACE. I WANT TO STRESS THAT. I WANT TO DRIVE IT HOME BY
 SHOWING YOU THIS IMAGE OF HIGHER MAGNIFICATION. IF I CAN GO TO THE NEXT TIME
 STEP, WE'RE GOING TO LOOK AT JUST THE NORTHERN HALF OF THAT
 IMAGE. WE COULD EASILY BLOW IT UP EVEN
 FURTHER. YOU CAN SEE ACROSS THE NORTHERN
 TERRAINS HERE WHICH INCLUDE THE NORTH POLE, BY THE WAY, THIS IS
 A TRUE COLOR IMAGE, ESSENTIALLY TRUE COLOR AS YOUR EYE MIGHT SEE
 IT, A WHOLE RANGE OF GEOLOGIC EXPRESSION. KATHY AND BILL WILL BE TALKING
 ABOUT THIS QUITE A BIT MORE SO I WON'T STEAL THEIR THUNDER, BUT
 JUST LET YOUR EYES GAZE FROM THE LAST ON THE WESTERN LIMB ACROSS
 THE DISK OVER TO THE EAST AND YOU CAN SEE DIFFERENT GEOLOGICAL
 UNITS, DIFFERENT KIND OF FEATURES TELLING THAT
 COMPLICATED STORY AGAIN, WHICH IS THERE FOR US TO UNRAVEL. AND IF I CAN HAVE THE NEXT TIME
 STEP AND WE CAN GO TO THE SOUTH, YOU SEE A STILL MORE COMPLICATED
 STORY WITH A GREAT EQUATORIAL DARK REGIONS, WITH TAMBA REGGIO,
 AS WE INFORMALLY CALL IT, THE HEART ON PLUTO, AND WHAT LOOKS
 LIKE MASSIVE TECTONIC FEATURES, BOTH RADIALLY EMANATING FROM
 TAMB ACTION REGGIO AND OTHERS THAT RUN MORE OR LESS
 NORTH/SOUTH. I DO WANT TO TELL YOU ABOUT ONE
 ASPECT OF THE INTERPRETATION THAT WE'VE BEEN MAKING OVER THE
 LAST WEEK IN LOOKING MORE CAREFULLY AT THE IMAGERY OF THE
 HEART, LIKE A REAL HEART, IT HAS TWO LOBES, ON THE LEFT AND ON
 THE RIGHT SIDE. THE LEFT IS THE WESTERN SIDE. I THINK EVE ON THE YOUR EYE YOU
 CAN DISTINGUISH A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO. THE RIGHT LOBE LOOKS LIKE A MUCH
 THINNER DEPOSIT THAT'S BEEN PAINTED ON TOP OF TOPOGRAPHY. OUR INTERPRETATION OF THAT
 MATERIAL IN THE RIGHT LOBE AS WELL AS THE MATERIAL EMANATING
 TO THE SOUTH BELOW THE WESTERN LOBE IS THAT IN BOTH CASES WE
 BELIEVE THE SOURCE FOR THAT MATERIAL IS THE WESTERN LOBE. IT'S BEING TRANSPORTED OFF THE
 WESTERN REGION OF THE WESTERN LOBE, PERHAPS BY SUBLIMATION AND
 WINDS AND RECONDENSATION OR PERHAPS BY A PROCESS WE HAVEN'T
 THOUGHT ABOUT. IN ANY CASE WE THINK WE'RE
 COMING TO UNDERSTAND THIS FEATURE JUST A LITTLE BIT. THIS IS EARLY DAYS. MAY HAVE A LITTLE MORE TO SAY
 ABOUT THAT. OUR NEXT TIME STEP IS A FALSE
 COLOR IMAGE STRETCHED TO SHOW THE DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES IN
 COLOR UNITS ON PLUTO AND HOW THEY CORRELATE WITH THE GEOLOGY. THIS IS PRETTY MIND-BLOWING. KATHY WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY
 ABOUT IT AND WHAT IT MEANS IN THE BIGGER PICTURE. BUT THEY HAVE DIFFERENT COLORS. SOON WE'LL HAVE COMPOSITION
 SPECK TROS COE PI TO SUPPORT THAT AT VERY HIGH-RESOLUTION. YOU CAN SEE THE POLAR REGIONS
 HAVE A DIFFERENT COLOR STILL AND A WE GET INTO THE DARK
 EQUATORIAL REGIONS THERE'S MORE INFORMATION. THE GEOLOGY AND THE COLOR,
 PROBABLY THE COMPOSITION SEEM TO BE CORRELATED. THIS TELLS US THE PAYLOAD WE
 BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE RECONNAISSANCE OF PLUTO SYSTEM
 IS REALLY THE RIGHT PAYLOAD BECAUSE WE HAVE ON BOARD THE
 SPACECRAFT NOW TREMENDOUS DATA SETS WITH HIGHER RESOLUTION
 COLORS THAN THIS, HIGHER RESOLUTION AND CHROMATIC MAPPING
 FOR DOING THE GEOLOGY. AND A SPECTACULAR DATA SET WITH
 COMPOSITIONAL INFORMATION WITH MORE THAN 64,000 PIXELS WE'VE
 PUT ON THE SURFACE. WE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL THIS STORY
 WELL OVER THE NEXT YEAR. LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT. I'M GOING TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT
 TIME STEP, TELL YOU A LITTLE ABOUT ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE WHERE
 WE'VE ALSO MADE SOME ADVANCES. THIS PARTICULAR GRAPH IS TO
 ILLUSTRATE SOMETHING ABOUT OUR ULTRAVIOLET MUTATION. THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT THAT WE DESIGNED AN ATMOSPHERE AROUND
 PLUTO'S LARGEST MOON. THERE'S BEEN A PRETTY BIG BODY
 OF LITERATURE SPECULATING ABOUT HOW SHARON COULD HAVE AN
 ATMOSPHERE. WE GOT THE SUMMARY DATA DOWN IN
 THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE DON'T HAVE THE FULL SPECTRAL
 DATA SET AND WON'T UNTIL SEPTEMBER. BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THAT STEP,
 YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE YELLOW LINE REPRESENTS THE PATH OF THE
 SUN AS SEEN BY THE -- FROM THE SPACECRAFT MOVING BEHIND SHARON. IT CLIPS THE NORTHERN REGION OF
 THE MOON.CHARON. IT CLIPS THE NORTHERN REGION OF
 THE MOON. JUST AS YOU CLICK ON EITHER SIDE
 OF THE BODY, YOU CAN SEE IN THAT RED AND WHITE GRAPH THAT THE
 LIGHT-FOOT LEVEL THE SUN PLUMMETS STRAIGHT TO ZERO. DOESN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE
 SOLAR DATA WE SHOWED YOU LAST WEEK FOR PLUTO, WHERE WE COULD
 CLEARLY SEE A REFRACTIVE SIGNATURE, A SLOW DECLINE IN THE
 LIGHT LEVELS. HERE IT'S JUST BASICALLY A
 SQUARE WAY, TELLING US THAT CHARON HAS MUCH LESS ATMOSPHERE
 THAN PLUTO IF ANY. WE CAN'T PUT STRICT BOUNDS ON IT
 BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE SPECTRA BUT WE'LL BE ABLE TO IN
 SEPTEMBER BECAUSE THOSE WILL BE DOWNLINKED. FOR NOW WE CAN ASSAY IT'S A MUCH
 MORE RAREFIED ATMOSPHERE AND THAT CONFIRMS OUR PREFLIGHT
 NOTIONS, OUR PREENCOUNTER NOTIONS AND WE'RE REALLY LOOKING
 FORWARD TO SEE HOW RAREFIED THAT IS. IT MAY BE THERE'S A THIN
 NITROGEN LAYER IN THE ATMOSPHERE OR METHANE OR OTHER CONSTITUENT,
 BUT IT MUST BE VERY TENUOUS COMPARED TO PLUTO. AGAIN, EMPHASIZING JUST HOW
 DIFFERENT THESE TWO OBJECTS ARE DESPITE THEIR CLOSE ASSOCIATION
 IN SPACE. ANOTHER PART OF ATMOSPHERIC
 SCIENCE IS NOW WE'VE GOT ON THE GROUND SOME OF THE RADIAL
 OCCUPATION DATA FOR PLUTO. A DEEP SPACE NETWORK TRANSMITTED
 A POWERFUL SIGNAL UP TO PLUTO TIMED TO ARRIVE WHEN THE
 SPACECRAFT WAS PASSING BEHIND THE PLANET SO WE COULD MEASURE
 THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AS YOU'LL HEAR FROM MIKE, WE GOT
 THE DATA, IT'S BEAUTIFUL DATA, AND THEY HAVE A WONDERFUL
 SCIENTIFIC SURPRISE. THE PRESSURE IN PLUTO'S
 ATMOSPHERE MEASURED AT THE BASE OF THE ATMOSPHERE FOR THE FIRST
 TIME IN HISTORY IS LOWER, SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN
 PREDICTED. AND THAT'S PROBABLY TELLING US A
 STORY AND MIKE WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY ABOUT THAT. I'D LIKE TO CLOSE WITH ONE MORE
 TIME STEP. THIS IS REALLY A SPECTACULAR IMAGE. THIS IS A SILHOUETTE OF PLUTO
 AFTER THE FLYBY. THIS IS OUR EQUIVALENT ON NEW
 HORIZONS OF THE APOLLO EARTH RISE PHOTOGRAPH THAT PROVES WE
 WERE THERE. YOU CAN ONLY GET THIS IMAGE BY
 GOING TO PLUTO AND CROSSING TO THE FAR SIDE AND LOOKING BACK. NOW AS STRIKING AND SPECTACULAR
 AS THIS IMAGE IS EMOTIONALLY, IT ALSO REPRESENTS A HUGE
 SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY. YOU SEE ABOVE THE DARK DISK OF
 PLUTO THE BAND OF LIGHT WHICH IS TELLING US THAT PLUTO HAS A HAZE
 LAYER IN ITS ATMOSPHERE AND MIKE WILL TELL YOU MORE ABOUT IT. >> THANK YOU, ALAN. I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO NEW
 RESULTS THAT ARE BASICALLY CHANGING THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT
 PLUTO'S ATMOSPHERE. WE'RE STARTING FROM SCRATCH ON
 WHAT WE THOUGHT WE KNEW ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE. MAY I HAVE THE FIRST TIME STEP
 PLEASE. THE FIRST GRAPHIC PLEASE. OKAY. THIS IS ONE OF OUR FIRST IMAGES
 OF PLUTO'S ATMOSPHERE. FOR 25 YEARS WE'VE KNOWN THAT
 PLUTO HAS AN ATMOSPHERE BUT IT'S BEEN KNOWN BY NUMBERS. THIS IS OUR FIRST PICTURE, THE
 FIRST TIME WE'VE REALLY SEEN IT. THIS WAS THE IMAGE THAT ALMOST
 BROUGHT TEARS TO THE EYES OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE TEAM. COULD I HAVE THE NEXT STEP
 PLEASE. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU'RE
 SEEING HERE. THIS IS THE ATMOSPHERE BACK LIT
 BY THE SUN AND IT'S LIVE SUNLIGHT SCATTERED BY SMALL
 PARTICLES IN THE ATMOSPHERE. THESE PARTICLES CONSTITUTE A
 HAZE LAYER. THE INSET IS A CROSS SECTION OF
 THAT HAZE LAYER SHOWING STRUCTURE. THE COLORS HAVE BEEN ENHANCED. THEY'RE NOT REAL COLORS. JUST SO YOU COULD SEE THERE IS
 STRUCTURE. THERE IS AN ARGUMENT GOING ON IN
 THE TEAM, WHETHER IT'S DYNAMICS OR CHEMISTRY. IT'S PROBABLY BOTH. BUT THE REAL ANSWER IS THAT THIS
 IS OUR FIRST PEEK AT WEATHER IN PLUTO'S ATMOSPHERE. OKAY. COULD I HAVE THE NEXT TIME STEP
 TO ILLUSTRATE THAT MORE? THERE IS A HINT THAT THERE IS
 EITHER A LAYER OF HAZE AT 30 MILES, 50 MILES, OR A
 COMBINATION OF LAYERS AND WAVES IN THIS REGION. THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THING WES -- THINGS WE'RE GOING TO SORT
 OUT IN THE COMING WEEKS AND THOSE WILL TELL US THE DETAILS
 OF HOW THE ATMOSPHERE WORKS. HAZE IS EXTENSIVE AND SPINS AT
 LEAST 100 MILES ABOVE THE SURFACE. THAT IS A BIG SURPRISE. THAT'S FIVE TERMS FURTHER THAN
 OUR MODELS PREDICTED. MODELS PREDICTED THE HAZE
 PARTICLES WOULD FORM LOW IN THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE THE
 TEMPERATURES ARE COLD, BUT IT'S FORMING HIGH IN THE ATMOSPHERE
 WHERE THE TEMPERATURES ARE HOT, HOT FROM PLUTO'S PERSPECTIVE,
 WHICH IS NOT HOT TO OUR PERSPECTIVE. NONETHELESS, IT'S A MYSTERY. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS WE'LL
 HAVE TO SORT OUT IN THE COMING DAYS. OKAY. THE HAZE IS PRETTY. IT'S A WAY TO SEE THE
 ATMOSPHERE. BUT IT'S A PIECE OF A BIG STORY
 THAT WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND FROM PLUTO. AND THAT IS HOW THE ATMOSPHERE
 AND THE SURFACES ARE CONNECTED. SO I HAD A SIMPLE ANIMATION TO
 ILLUSTRATE ONE ASPECT OF THAT CONNECTION. COULD I HAVE THE NEXT TIME STEP,
 PLEASE? OKAY. THIS SHOWS HOW METHANE IN THE
 UPPER ATMOSPHERE IS BROKEN APART BY ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION FROM
 THE SUN AND TO CHEMICAL COMBINES, RADICALS, SMALL AT
 TOMS AND MOLECULES THAT REACT TRIG ERR SET OF CHEMICAL
 REACTIONS THAT FORM COMPLEX HYDROCARBONS LIKE ETHYLENE AND
 ACETYLENE, WHICH WERE DETECTED BY NEW HORIZONS. AS TIME GOES ON, THESE BUILD UP,
 THEY BECOME SUPER SATURATED AND THEY SHOULD NUCLEATE TO FORM
 HAZE PARTICLES WHICH THEN GROW AND EVENTUALLY THEY WILL GET BIG
 ENOUGH SO THAT YOU'LL SEE A HAZE LAYER AND IT WILL FALL TO THE
 GROUND. AT SOME POINT IN THIS CYCLE,
 THOSE HAZE PARTICLES ARE CHEMICALLY PROCESSED TO PRODUCE
 WHAT WE CALL THOLENS, CHEMICALLY ALTERED HYDROCARBONS THAT HAVE A
 RED COLOR, AND WE THINK THAT IS HOW PLUTO'S SURFACE GOT ITS
 REDDISH HUE. IN A MINUTE, KATHY WILL TALK
 MORE ABOUT THE COLOR AND KOCH SITUATION OF THE SURFACE. THIS IS JUST ONE PIECE OF THAT
 STORY. IT'S NOT A COHERENT PIECE YET. THERE ARE SOME MYSTERIES. AS I SAID, WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
 WHY THERE'S A HAZE LAYER UP TO 100 MILES ALTITUDE. IT REALLY IS A MYSTERY. OKAY. THE NEXT STORY REGARDS SURFACE
 PRESSURE. JUST GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF
 CONTEXT HERE. UNTIL A PLANETARY ATMOSPHERE,
 THE SURFACE PRESSURE AT ANY LEVEL IS A MEASURE OF THE WEIGHT
 OF THE AIR ABOVE THAT LEVEL. AND WEIGHT IS GRAVITY ACTING ON
 MASS. SO IF YOU KNOW THE SURFACE
 PRESSURE OF A PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE, YOU CAN GET A PRETTY
 GOOD ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL MASS OF THAT ATMOSPHERE. AND IT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE
 THAT'S A WAY OF QUANTIFYING THE GLOBAL STATE OF AN ATMOSPHERE. OKAY. SO IF I CAN HAVE THE NEXT
 GRAPHIC, PLEASE. OKAY. THIS SHOWS SURFACE PRESSURE ON
 PLUTO AS A FUNCTION OF TIME. THE UNITS MIGHT BE A LITTLE
 STRANGE TO YOU. THEY'RE IN MICROBARS. A MICROBAR IS ONE MILLIONTH OF
 SEA LEVEL PRESSURE ON EARTH. AND THE TIME SCALE IS THERE SO,
 1989 UP TO JUST BEFORE THE PRESENT. NOW, WHAT IS INTERESTING HERE IS
 THAT 1-IN 1989 PLUTO WAS AT ITS CLOSEST DISTANCE TO THE SUN.
 AND NOW PLUTO IS MOVING AWAY FROM THE SUN IN ITS VERY
 ELLIPTICAL ORBIT. AS IT MOVES AWAY, IT SHOULD BE
 COOLING, THE NITROGEN SHOULD BE CONDENSING ONTO THE SURFACE, AND
 THE MASS SHOULD BE DECREASING, BUT WE DON'T SEE THAT. WE SEE THE EXACT OPPOSITE. THAT HAS BEEN VERY INTERESTING,
 NONETHELESS. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE
 THIS OUT. WHAT I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU NOW
 IS A NEW DATA POINT, SOME MORE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE TO ADD
 TO THIS STORY. IT IS JUST ONE DATA POINT, BUT I
 DO WANT TO SAY IT IS SIGNIFICANT AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
 FIGURE IT OUT. OKAY. SO THIS IS IT. THIS IS WHAT REX, THE RADIAL
 SCIENCE EXPERIMENT, HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS STORY. A NEW DATA POINT SHOWS THE
 PRESSURE IS AT MOST 10 MICROBAR, UPPER LIMIT. THE MASS, IF YOU WILL, OF
 PLUTO'S ATMOSPHERE, HAS CHANGED BY A FACTOR OF TWO, DECREASED BY
 A FACTOR OF TWO IN ABOUT TWO YEARS. THAT'S PRETTY ASTONISHING, AT
 LEAST TO AN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENTIST. THAT'S TELLING YOU SOMETHING IS
 HAPPENING. IT IS JUST ONE DATA POINT. THESE ARE EARLY RETRIEVALS. WE HAVE MORE DATA COMING AS ALAN
 SAYS, AND THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY. BUT IT'S ANOTHER MYSTERY THAT
 WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, MONTHS,
 YEARS, AND SO ON. OKAY. NOW I'M GOING TO TURN IT OVER
 THE KATRINA TY OLKIN, WHO'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE COLOR
 AND COMPOSITION OF PLUTO'S SURFACE. >> THANKS, MIKE. I'M GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE
 COLOR AND COMPOSITION AND TRY TO TIE THIS TOGETHER SO YOU CAN
 UNDERSTAND WHAT WE KNOW FROM THIS COLOR. THE COLOR IS REALLY AN INDICATOR
 OF DIFFERENT COMPOSITION NAL UNITS. FIRST TIME STEP, THIS IS THAT
 SAME FALSE COLOR IMAGE ALAN SHOWED. I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT WE'RE SEEING
 SCIENTIFICALLY AND SOME OF THE THINGS WE KNOW AND UNDERSTAND
 FROM LOOKING AT THIS IMAGE. FIRST OF ALL, YOU CAN SEE THE
 DARK REGION DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE IMAGE. THAT'S NEAR THE EQUATOR. THAT'S THE DARKEST REGION. IF YOU REMEMBER, THERE'S DARK
 REGIONS ALL AROUND THAT AREA, EVEN ON THE OTHER SIDE OF PLUTO. THEN JUST ABOVE IT, IT'S A
 LITTLE BIT BRIGHTER AND A LITTLE LESS RED.
 AND THEN AT THE NORTH POLE YOU SEE THE BRIGHT -- BRIGHTBRIGHTER. PUTTING THE LONGITUDE AND
 LATITUDE ON THE GRID HELPS YOU DRAW YOUR EYE TO THAT PATTERN. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT BECAUSE
 IT GOES TO THE COMPLEXITY THAT MIKE WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT,
 ABOUT THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE SURFACE AND THE INTERACTION. PLUTO HAS A VERY COMPLICATED
 SEASONAL PATTERN OF TRANSPORT OF ICES OVER -- IT TAKES 248 YEARS
 FOR PLUTO TO GO AROUND THE SUN. AND PLUTO HAS A VERY ECCENTRIC
 ORBIT. SO SOMETIMES IT'S MUCH CLOSER TO
 THE SUN THAN AT OTHER TIMES. ADDITIONALLY, PLUTO'S NORTH POLE
 IS TILTED OVER AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 120 DEGREES RELATIVE TO
 THE PLANE IT ORBITS IN. ALL OF THESE FACTORS TOGETHER
 CAUSE DIFFERENT PARTS OF PLUTO TO GET DIFFERENT AMOUNTS OF
 SUNLIGHT. AND THE SUNLIGHT IS POWERING THE
 SUBLIMATION OF THE ISLE ICES FROM THE SURFACE INTO THE ATMOSPHERE. SO SOME PARTS ARE KIND OF BAKED
 LIKE NEAR THE EQUATOR, AND OTHER PARTS RECEIVE THESE CONDENSATION
 OF THESE ICES AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE NORTH POLE HERE. AND SO WE'VE GOT A DIFFERING
 PATTERN THAT YOU CAN SEE MANIFESTED ON PLUTO THAT WE
 UNDERSTAND FROM MODELING OF THE SEASONAL TRANSPORT OF THESE
 ICES. BUT THERE'S ONE GLARING
 DIFFERENCE IN THIS PATTERN THAT I JUST CALLED OUT, AND THAT IS
 TOMBO REGGIO. NEXT TIME STEP, PLEASE. TOMBO REGGIO CLEARLY INTERRUPTS
 THIS PATTERN OF LATITUDE NAL VARIATION OF COLORS AND
 BRIGHTNESSES. ONE THING I SHOULD ATHD IS THOSE
 SH -- DARKER REGIONS ARE LIKELY THE THOLENS THAT MIKE WAS
 DESCRIBING THAT WERE RAINING OUT FROM THE HAZES OR FALLING FROM
 THE ATMOSPHERE AND THE HAZES. WE'RE SEEING METHANE, CARBON
 ICES THERE. ON THE NORTHERN PART OF PLUTO WE
 SEE METHANE AND NITROGEN BUT NOT CARBON MONOXIDE. SO MAYBE WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN
 TOMBO REGGIO IS A SOURCE REGION FOR SOME OF THESE SPECIFIC ICES
 THAT COMPLICATES IN ADDITION THE STORY OF THIS SEASONAL TRANSPORT
 THAT I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT. WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT
 THAT IN THE FUTURE. AS YOU'VE HEARD, WE HAVE A SMALL
 BIT OF OUR COMPOSITIONAL DATA DOWN, AND WE'LL GET A LOT MORE
 INFORMATION WHEN WE GET THE REST DOWN. BUT WE'VE GOT SOME GREAT IMAGES
 AND BILL McKINNON IS GOING TO TELL US ABOUT THE GEOLOGY OF
 THIS TOMBO REGGIO REGION AND NEARBY VICINITY. >> THANKS, KATHY. OKAY. CAN I HAVE MY FIRST GRAPHIC? NEXT, PLEASE. WE'LL BE LOOKING AT OUR FABULOUS
 NEAR ENCOUNTER HEMISPHERE. I KNOW YOU CAN SEE IT. YOU CAN START THE ANIMATION. AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A FULL
 SEVEN FRAMES OF WHAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE A 12-FRAME MOSAIC
 AT HIGHER RESOLUTION BUT NOT EVEN OUR HIGHEST RESOLUTION THAT
 WILL COME DOWN LATER. THIS AREA AND THE NEXT SLIDE,
 NEXT, THIS AREA COVERS IN ITS ENTIRETY THIS VAST MORE OR LESS
 FLAT ICY PLANE. IT'S PRETTY BIG, ABOUT THE SIZE
 OF TEXAS. ALL AROUND THE PRIVILEGE FI AND
 IN THE INTERIOR ARE GEOLOGICAL WONDERS AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE
 SOME OF THOSE WONDERS WITH YOU. COULD I HAVE THE NEXT SLIDE,
 PLEASE? SO FIRST I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT
 THAT ORANGE BOX, THE RECTANGLE THAT YOU SEE AT THE UPPER LEFT
 OF THE MOSAIC. NEXT SLIDE, PLEASE. THIS IS THE NORTHERN BOUNDARY OF
 SPLIT NICK PLANA. THERE'S A LITTLE SCALE BAR DOWN
 THERE, BUT BASICALLY THIS IS ABOUT 250 MILES ACROSS, ABOUT
 THE DISTANCE BETWEEN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI, AND ST. LOUIS, A
 CITY WHICH I PICKED COMPLETELY AT RANDOM. OKAY. OKAY. NEXT SLIDE. I'VE MARKED SOME THINGS HERE TO
 HELP SORT OF GUIDE THIS TOUR. SO MOST OF THE PICTURE YOU SEE
 IS SPLITNIK PLANA. YOU CAN SEE THIS REALLY WELL AS
 YOU MOVE TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE IMAGE WHERE THE CONTRAST BETWEEN
 THE BRIGHT AND DARK SHOWS UP. BUT AT THE TOP OF THE PICTURE
 IT'S REALLY DIFFERENT. THERE'S A RUGGED LANDSCAPE
 THERE, A DEGRADED LANDSCAPE, SOMETHING THAT TO A GEOLOGIST'S
 EYE LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN DEEPLY AND EXTENSIVELY
 ERODED. WE CAN TELL IT'S OLD AS WELL
 BECAUSE YOU CAN SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYE VARIOUS IMPACT CRATERS
 OF LARGE SIZE. BUT WHAT'S REALLY INTERESTING TO
 US IS THE ACTUAL INTERACTION BETWEEN THE SPLITNIK PLANUM AND
 THE TERRAIN AT THE TOP. IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY, YOU CAN
 SEE A PATTERN THAT INDICATES THE FLOW OF VISCOUS ICE TOWARDS THE
 CLIFF BOUNDARY ON THE RUGGED TERRAIN. WE CALL THESE STREAMLINES. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE
 STREAMLINES WHICH I'VE MARKED WITH THESE CURVED ARROWS YOU SEE
 THERE, THEY LOOK JUST LIKE, AND WE INTERPRET THEM TO BE JUST
 LIKE GLACIAL FLOW ON THE EARTH. I DON'T HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT
 GLASHERS ON THE RERT MADE OF ICE LIKE IN ANTARCTIC AND GREENLAND,
 AND WON'T MOVE ANYWHERE, IT'S IMMOBILE. ON PLUTO, THE KIND OF ICES WE
 THINK MAKE UP THE PLANUM, WHICH KATHY TALKED ABOUT, CARBON
 MONOXIDE ICE, NITROGEN ICE, METHANE ICE, THESE ICES ARE
 GEOLOGICALLY SOFT AND MALLEABLE EVEN AT PLUTO CONDITION, AND
 THEY WILL FLOW LIKE IN THE SAME WAY THAT GLACIERS DO ON THE
 EARTH. WE HAVE ACTUAL EVIDENCE FOR
 BASICALLY RECENT GEOLOGICAL ACTIVITY. ONE MORE THING, ONE ARROW AT THE
 12:00 POSITION, WE CAN PROBABLY SEE A FLOW OF THIS, SOLID
 NITROGEN ICE FLOEING THROUGH A BREACH IN AN OLD IMPACT CRATER
 AND PARTIALLY FILLING IN THE INTERIOR OF THAT CRATER. LIKE KATHY SAID, WE KNEW THERE
 WAS NITROGEN ICE ON PLUTO FROM SPECTRA. WE'VE KNOWN THIS FOR YEARS. WE IMAGINED THAT NITROGEN WAS
 SUBLIMATING AND EVAPORAING IN ONE PLACE AND CONDENSING IN
 ANOTHER PLACE, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE SEE EVIDENCE FOR RECENT
 GEOLOGICAL ACTIVITY IS SIMPLY A DREAM COME TRUE. I WANT TO BACK UP JUST ONE
 LITTLE BIT AND SAY WHEN I SAY RECENT I DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN
 YESTERDAY. I MEAN GEOLOGICALLY RECENT. BUT THE APPEARANCE OF THIS
 TERRAIN, THE UTTER LACK OF IMPACT CRATERS ON THE SPUTNIK
 PLANUM TELLS US THAT THIS IS REALLY A YOUNG UNIT AND WE HAVE
 MODELS OF WHAT SMALL BELTS WOULD BE ON PLUTO AND THEY GIVE
 VARIOUS ANSWERS BUT THE BEST ONES IMPLY THAT THE ICES OF
 SPUTNIK PLANUM AND THE FLOW FEATURES WE SEE, I SHOULD POINT
 OUT THE CURVED ARROWS AT THE UPPER LEFT, WE CAN ACTUALLY SEE
 THEM GOING AROUND WHAT LOOK TO BE BARRIER ISLANDS, REALLY KIND
 OF CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE. JUST TO GET BACK TO THE AGE, THE
 AGE IS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE TOTAL AGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM,
 PROBABLY NO MORE THAN A FEW TENS OF MILLIONS OF YEARS. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT NITROGEN ICE,
 WHAT WE KNOW OR CAN THEORETICALLY ESTIMATE ABOUT THE
 HEAT FLOW COMING FROM THE INTERIOR OF PLUTO, THERE'S NO
 REASON WHY THIS CANNOT BE GOING ON TODAY. OKAY. SO LET'S GO TO THE NEXT TIME
 STEP. NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO DOWN TO
 THE BOTTOM OF SPUTNIK PLANUM THERE, AND LET'S BLOW THAT UP. THIS IS A VERY BUSY SCENE, OKAY,
 AND IT'S A BUILT BIGGER THAN THE ONE I JUST SHOWED YOU. THIS ONE'S ABOUT 400 MILES
 ACROSS, SO THAT'S LIKE TAKING A DRIVE FROM L.A. TO PHOENIX,
 ALTHOUGH IT'S A BIT COLDER. ANYWAY, NEXT TIME STEP, PLEASE. SO HERE ARE SOME THINGS --
 ACTUALLY AT THE TOP OF THE IMAGE YOU CAN STILL SEE SPUTNIK
 PLANUM. YOU CAN STILL SEE IT'S POLYGON
 AND AT THE VERY BOTTOM IS THIS ANCIENT BLACK HEAVILY CRATERED
 REGION WHICH WE'VE BEEN INFORMALLY CALLING CAZULU
 REGGIO. AT THE 3:00 POSITION ARE A GROUP
 OF MOUNTAIN BLOCKS WHICH WE DISCOVERED LAST WEEK AND WE ALL
 INFORMALLY NAMED THAT A WELL. IN THIS PICTURE YOU CAN SEE KIND
 OF IN THE CENTER, ACTUALLY ABOVE IN THE SENTER AND TOWARDS THE
 LEFT ANOTHER RANGE OR ARRANGEMENT OF MOUNTAIN BLOCKS. AND THESE MOUNTAINOUS REGIONS,
 TWO OF THEM, ARE ACTUALLY SOMEWHAT SIMILAR. YOU MIGHT THINK THE ONES ON THE
 LEFT ARE DIFFERENT, BUT THAT'S JUST BECAUSE THE SUN IS HIGHER
 IN THE SKY WHEN THAT PICTURE WAS TAKEN SO YOU DON'T SEE THE
 SHADOWS QUITE AS PROMINENTLY. THE ARRANGEMENT AND APPEARANCE
 OF THESE MOUNTAINS IS SIMILAR FROM ONE REGION TO THE OTHER. WE'VE GIVE AN INFORMAL NAME TO
 THIS MOUNTAIN BLOCK AFTER SIR EDMOND HILLARY, FIRST SUMMITED
 EVEREST BACK IN 1953. THE SCIENTIFICALLY INTERESTING
 AND FASCINATING THING ABOUT THE PICTURE TO ME IS THAT THE
 SPUTNIK PLANUM ICE, MOBILE ICES, SEEM TO HAVE MOVED AND
 SURROUNDED AND BATHED THE MOUNTAINS. IN FACT, THEY SEEM TO COVER UP
 NOT JUST -- INVADE AROUND THE MOUNTAIN BLOCKS BUT THEY EXTEND
 ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THEY SEEM TO FORGET OUT JUST ONTO THE EDGE
 OF THE CAZULU REGGIO. WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT IN DETAIL
 THERE'S A LOT OF FINE STRUCTURE IN THE ICE BETWEEN THE TWO AND A
 LOT OF FINE STRUCTURE THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE DIFFERENT
 SCALE, FINER SCALE THAN THE POLYGONS WE SEE THROUGHOUT. THAT TELLS US THAT THE ICE IN
 THAT INTERVENING REGION BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND CAZULU IS
 SUBSTANTIALLY THINNER. ONE MORE FUN THING YOU CAN SEE,
 JUST AS YOU LOOK AT THE EDGE OF THE DARK UNIT, YOU SEE SORT OF
 CIRCLES OF BRIGHT MOBILE ICE. OKAY. SO LET'S PUT THIS ALL TOGETHER
 AND TAKE A FLYOVER FROM ONE END OF SPUTNIK PLANUM TO THE OTHER. WE'RE GOING TO START AT THE
 NORTH. WE'RE GOING TO CAREEN OVER THE
 CLIFFS ON TO SPUTNIK PLANUM. THERE ARE THE ICE FLOES. THEY'RE STILL THERE BUT OBSCURED
 BY BRIGHTER ICES AND IT'S OUR APPROACHING THE REGION THAT IS
 SUPER RICH IN THE CARBON MONOXIDE THAT KATHY WAS JUST
 TALKING ABOUT. ANYWAY, IT'S A LONG FLIGHT ALL
 THE WAY TO THE SOUTH SO WE'LL SKIP OVER THAT PART AND WE'LL
 REJOIN OUR TOUR HERE COMING UP ON THE HILLARY MONTAY. BIG BLOCKS, SMALL BLOCKS AND
 BITS. THE CAZULU REGGIO, DARK ASPHALT
 CONE SURFACE. AS WE MOVE OVER THE HILLARY
 MONTES, THAT CRATER ITSELF IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE D.C. METRO
 AREA. AS WE MOVE OFF THE HILLARY
 MONTIES, THERE ARE THE NORGAY. THERE'S A WHOLE LOT MORE WE'RE
 GOING LEARN ABOUT PLUTO. JUST AS ALAN SAID AND JIM SAID,
 MOST OF OUR IMAGES, MOST OF OUR DATA ARE STILL ON THE SPACECRAFT
 OUTBOUND FROM PLUTO AND WE'LL BE DOWNLINK THIS IN THE MONTHS
 ALMOST A FULL YEAR OR MORE AHEAD. WITH THAT, BACK TO YOU, DUANE. >> THANK YOU. NOW WE'RE GOING TO TRANSITION
 INTO QUESTIONS, HIT THE PHONE LINES, SOCIAL MEDIA, AND COME
 BACK. I'LL GIVE YOU THE FIRST QUESTION
 BECAUSE YOUR EXPRESSION, PRETTY COOL STUFF, RIGHT? >> AVIATION WEEK FOR
 DR. McKINNON. I HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT A COUPLE
 THINGS I SAW IN THE NEW DISK IMAGE. IT LOOKS LIKE A COPYRIGHT OR
 JUST TO THE WEST OF THE PLANE. IT'S A BIG CRATER I GUESS WITH
 SOME CENTRIC CIRCLES. IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THAT
 MIGHT BE. THEN ALSO JUST TO CONTINUE ON
 THE ICE FLOES. DO YOU HAVE ELEVATION DATAS AS
 TO WHAT'S MAKING IT FLOW AND IS IT FLOWING DOWN INTO THE
 MOUNTAINS, THE PLANE HIGHER THAN THE MOUNTAINS? >> I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY
 TALKING ABOUT THERE ARE SOME CIRCULAR FEATURES I DIDN'T
 PARTICULARLY POINT OUT IN THE FULL DISK IMAGE, AND TO THE WEST
 AND TO THE NORTH OF SPUTNIK PLANUM AND TOMBAUGH REGGIO
 ITSELF, AND THOSE ARE PROBABLY IMPACT CRATERS OF SOME SCALE. MAYBE 150 OR UP TO 250
 KILOMETERS WIDE. SO SOME PARTS OF PLUTO ARE
 PROBABLY AT LEAST FUNDAMENTALLY ANCIENT. EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE ACTIVE
 GEOLOGICAL PROCESSES. >> THERE ARE A FEW WITH CENTRAL
 PEAKS. >> I THINK THE SCALE -- LOOKING
 AT THE BIG PICTURE OF PLUTO YOU'D BE REALLY LOOKING AT VERY
 DISTINCT -- >> I THINK HE WAS THINKING OF
 THE ONE WE INFORMALLY CALLED ELLIOTT CRATER. YOU CAN SEE IT IN THIS IMAGE
 THERE. >> YOU MEAN THE ONE JUST UP AT
 THE 10:30 POSITION OFF THE EDGE? IS THAT THE ONE YOU MEAN OR --
 >> YEAH. >> YEAH. >> OH, YEAH. THAT'S ANOTHER CRATE DESCH WELL,
 IT'S NOT REALLY SHOWING ON MY PARTICULAR GRAPHICS BUT IT'S
 ANOTHER ONE OF THESE CRATERS THAT HAS BRIGHT ICE IN IT,
 PROBABLY A REMNANT, BUT ALSO A CENTRAL PEAK SO, THE CENTRAL
 PEAK IS DARK AND STICKING UP THROUGH A BRIGHT RED.
 AND YOUR OTHER QUESTION WAS? ELEVATION, YES. WE HAVE -- YOU KNOW, WE'VE
 MEASURED THE ELEVATION OF SOME OF THE MOUNTAINS BY MEASURING
 THEIR SHADOW LENGTHS. IF WE DON'T HAVE SHADOW LENGTHS
 WE USE ANOTHER TECHNIQUE WHICH DETERMINES THE RELATIVE SLOPE
 AND WE INTEGRATE AND DETERMINE -- IT'S CALLED -- WE
 GET SOME ESTIMATE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND CAN ACTUALLY SEE
 ON THE SPUTNIK PLANUM THAT THE INDIVIDUAL POLYGONAL CELLS ARE
 HIGHER THAN THE CELLS BY A FEW TENS OF MEET RS. BUT THE PRIMARY TECHNIQUE WE
 WANT TO USE IS CALLED STEREO IMAGING. WE DON'T HAVE OUR DATA YET TO DO
 THAT STEREO ANALYSIS. BUT WE ARE GOING TO GET MORE
 FRAMES OF THAT MOSAIC, AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO GET A WHOLE SWEEP
 FROM AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF OBSERVATIONS COVERING THE
 WHOLE BASICALLY OF PLUTO AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BEAUTIFUL
 STEREO VIEW OF WHETHER ON THE WHOLE WHETHER SPUTNIK PLANUM IS
 HIGH OR LOW WITH RESPECT TO THINGS NEARBY. THE ONE THING YOU CAN CERTAINLY
 TELL, THOUGH, JUST BY EYE IS IN THE NORTH THE PLANU SMSHGS LOWER
 THAN THE CLIFFS AND IT APPEARS AT THE SOUTH WHERE IT SEEMS TO
 ON-RAMP ONTO CAZULU REGGIO SO IT'S KIND OF A GRADATIONAL
 VALUE. >> THANK YOU. ANOTHER QUESTION? HERE THEN THE PHONE LINES. >> FROM SCIENCE MAGAZINE. BILL, IF I COULD GET YOU TO
 SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT COULD BE DRIVING THESE FLOWS AND ALSO HOW
 THIS SOURCE REGION GOT THERE TO BEGIN WITH. THERE'S BEEN DEBATES, YOU KNOW,
 WHETHER THIS ICE HAS ACCUMULATED FROM ABOVE, LAYERS OF FROST
 TURNING INTO I GUESS GLACIER-LIKE THINGS OVER TIME OR
 WHETHER SOMETHING IS ALLOWING ICES TO WELL UP FROM WITHIN. SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW THIS
 INTRIGUING SPOT RIGHT IN THE BELLY OF THE PLANET GOT TO BE
 THERE AND THEN WHAT'S DRIVING IT? >> WELL, YOU'VE SORT OF ANSWERED
 YOUR OWN QUESTION, BUT, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE A REGION, A VAST
 REGION THAT SEEMS TO BE TRULY A RESERVOIR. I MEAN, WE TRIBE IT POETICALLY
 AS THE BEATING HEART. IT MAY BE THE SUPPLY ZONE -- THE
 SUPPLY FOR ENTIRE ATMOSPHERE FAR LOT OF GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY. ULTIMATELY HOW IT WAS FORMED YOU
 CAN IMAGINE DIFFERENT THINGS. YOU COULD GO ALL THE WAY BACK IN
 TIME AND REALIZE IT WAS IMPACT BASED OR MAYBE IT'S SOMETHING
 ELSE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. WE SEE AT THE MARGINS, THERE'S A
 JUMBLE OF MOUNTAINS, HIGHLY DEFORMED TOPOGRAPHY. WE KNOW GEOLOGIC ACTIVITY BEYOND
 WHAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HAS DEFORMED THE CRUST THERE. WE CAN'T FULLY EXPLAIN WHAT'S
 GOING ON BECAUSE WE'VE ONLY SEEN THESE SEVEN IMAGES CLOSE UP.
 AND SO WHEN ALL OF THE REST OF THAT STUFF COMES DOWN AND WHEN
 WE GET SOME OF THIS STUFF UNCOMPRESSED ON THE GROUND,
 WE'LL HAVE A MUCH MORE COMPLETE STORY. BUT YOU CAN IMAGINE AS I USE THE
 WORD RESERVOIR, YOU CAN IMAGINE WITH ANY RESERVOIR, IT CAN BE
 FILLED IN FROM THE SIDE WITH GLACIERS FLOWING INTO IT, IT CAN
 BE FILLED IN FROM BELOW. YOU CAN IMAGINE THAT INSIDE THE
 ICY CRUST OF PLUTO THERE'S ENOUGH SPACE WHERE NITROGEN
 WOULD ACTUALLY NEED A LIQUID, BECAUSE IT WOULD BE WARMER
 INSIDE PLUTO AS IT IS INSIDE ALL PLANETS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR
 SURFACES. AND THIS RESERVOIR OF LIQUID
 NITROGEN COULD ACTUALLY SUPPLY THE PLANET. THESE ARE ALL INTERESTING IDEAS,
 AS MICHAEL WAS SAYING, VERY EARLY DAYS AND WE'RE HAVING --
 WE'RE ENJOYING A GREAT DEAL OF ANIMATED DISCUSSION. >> I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ADD ONE
 THING, WHICH IS THAT THESE IMAGES, NOTHING LIKE THESE
 IMAGES EXISTED JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO. WE'RE SORT OF REACTING TO IT IN
 ALMOST REAL TIME. BUT WHAT WE'RE LEARNING AND VERY
 FUNDAMENTALLY IS THAT ON PLUTO WE HAVE A MUCH MORE INTIMATE AND
 INTRICATE INTERACTION BETWEEN GEOLOGY AND THE TRANSPORT AND
 SEASONAL CLIMATE CYCLES, THOSE KIND OF THINGS. THEY'RE FORCING ONE ANOTHER AND
 FEEDING ONE ANOTHER AND CREATING A VERY COMPLICATED AND LAYERED
 STORY ABOUT THE PLANET'S HISTORY. AND IT'S RARE IN THE PANTHEON OF
 OBJECTS IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE SEEN THIS KIND OF A
 COMPLICATED STORY. I'M REMINDED IN SOME WAYS OF
 TITAN, FOR EXAMPLE, BUT FEW OTHER EXAMPLES THAT ARE SO
 DRAMATIC. IT'S BRAND NEW. >> YEAH. JUST YOU WAIT TILL THE REST OF
 THOSE IMAGES COME IN. I KNOW THERE'S GOING TO BE GREAT
 STUFF THERE. >> OKAY. LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES THEN
 WE'LL COME BACK HERE FOR SOCIAL MEDIA AND ANY OTHER QUESTIONS IN
 THE AUDIENCE FOR A WRAP-UP. PHONE LINES, FIRST UP IS KEN
 SHANK FROM ""THE NEW YORK TIMES."" >> REMIND ME OF THE
 TEMPERATURES, WHAT THE TEMPERATURES ARE THAT ALLOW
 THESE GLACIAL FLOES, HIGHER UP WITH THE HAZES. >> THE TEMPERATURE AT THE
 SURFACE IS ABOUT 38 DEGREES CALVIN, WHICH IS 380 DEGREES
 BELOW ZERO FAHRENHEIT. SO THAT'S INCREDIBLY COLD. IF YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE
 ICES, I MEAN ICE TEMPERATURE -- >> YEAH, AND WELL, BUT IN
 CASE -- EVEN AT 38 KELVIN, THOUGH, SOLID NITROGEN CAN
 CREEP. BELOW GROUND, THAT NITROGEN WILL
 WARM UP A LITTLE BIT AND IT'S VERY SENSITIVE TO TEMPERATURE. NOTHING SCIENTIFICALLY --
 >> NOT AT ALL. EVEN IF THERE'S A MODESTLY DEEP
 LAYER IN SPUTNIK PLANUM, YOU GET DOWN TENS OF METERS AND IT MAY
 BE MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT, THE PRESSURE FROM THE OVERBURDEN OF
 ICE CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE THE PROPERTIES OF THE NITROGEN
 BECAUSE IT'S GETTING WARM SORE THAT IT'S LESS VISCOUS AND MUCH
 MORE ABLE TO FLOW. THERE MAY BE EVEN CONTINUES
 WHERE YOU CAN GET LIQUID NITROGEN FLOWING BELOW A DEEP
 LAYER OF ICE OF TENS OR HUNDREDS OF METERS. THAT MAY BE PART OF THIS STORY,
 AS WELL, BUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO TO BE ABLE TO SAY
 THAT WITH ANY CONFIDENCE. >> NEXT UP. REUTERS. IRENE? >> THANKS, DUANE. I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. FIRST I THINK IT'S FOR MICHAEL
 SOMERS. I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE
 SURFACE PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS SHOW THAT THE PLUTO ATMOSPHERE
 HAD DECREASED BY A FACTOR OF TWO IN TWO YEARS. COULD YOU JUST TELL US WHAT THAT
 2-YEAR-OLD DATA SET IS AND HOW ACCURATE THAT IS COMPARED TO
 WHAT YOU'RE GETTING WITH NEW HORIZONS? >> YES. THE DATA THAT I SHOWED THAT TIME
 PLOT FOR PLUTO'S ATMOSPHERE IS BASED UPON STELLAR -- WHERE WE
 FOLLOW THE SUNLIGHT BEHIND PLUTO'S ATMOSPHERE AND LOOK AT
 THE EXTINCTION OF THAT SUNLIGHT TO GET A MEASURE OF HOW MUCH GAS
 IS THERE. SO WE HAVE USED THOSE TO
 EXTRAPOLATE DOWN TO THE SURFACE TO GET A SURFACE PRESSURE. AND THAT'S WHAT WAS DONE FOR
 EACH OF THOSE BLUE DATA POINTS THAT YOU SAW. AS FAR AS WE COULD TELL, THOSE
 ARE ACCURATE MEASUREMENTS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE THE STELLAR OK
 ULATION OCCURS. THE THING THAT'S DIFFERENT ABOUT
 REX IS WITH RADIO WAVES YOU CAN GO RIGHT DOWN TO THE SURFACE. THE REX DATA WAS EXTREMELY GOOD. THIS SHOULD BE OUR BEST
 MEASUREMENT OF THE SURFACE PRESSURE OF PLUTO. AGAIN, THIS IS EARLY, OUR FIRST
 DATA, OUR FIRST RETRIEVAL, MORE STUDIES TO DO ON THIS. TAKING IT AT FACE VALUE, IT
 APPEAR AS IF THE ATMOSPHERE HAS CHANGED IN MASS BY QUITE A BIT. >> IRENE, IN CONTEXT, ALL THOSE
 STELLAR OCCULTATIONS ARE OBTAINED FROM EARTH. ONLY THE RED DATA POINTS ARE
 OBTAINED FROM NEW HORIZONS. WE'RE DETECTING WHAT MAY BE A
 REALLY SIGNIFICANT SHORT-TERM VARIATION IN THAT ATMOSPHERE. MIGHT BE A TURNAROUND. WE'LL HAVE TO SEE. >> WHAT WILL REALLY SHEP THE
 MOST RECENT OBSERVATIONS FROM SOPHIA, WHICH OF COURSE IS ONE
 OF OUR 747s THAT HAS A FABULOUS TELESCOPE THAT MOST RECENTLY IN
 THE END OF JUNE RACED DOWN TO NEW ZEALAND AND CHASED PLUTO'S
 SHADOW AS IT ALSO WAS OCCULTED BY ANOTHER STAR AND GOT A VERY
 BEAUTIFUL OCCULTATION, A VERY RECENT ONE THAT COULD EASILY BE
 COMPARED WITH PLUTO DATA FOR WHICH HAD BEEN MY HELP IN
 INTERPRETATION OF PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS. >> REALLY GOOD POINT. >> IRENE, DID YOU HAVE A
 FOLLOW-UP? >> THE REDDISH HUE AND THE
 THEORY THAT PERHAPS IT'S THESE CHEMICALLY ALTERED METHANE THAT
 ARE RAINING DOWN THESE THINGS. WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE IF YOU
 WERE ON THE SURFACE OF PLUTO? WOULD THE PARTICLES BE BIG
 ENOUGH TO SEE LIKE SNOW OR ICE OR FROST? AND ALSO WHY WOULD THEY NOT BE
 OR ARE THEY UNIVERSALLY DISTRIBUTED, DO YOU THINK? AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE HAPPENS
 ON THE SURFACE? AND I KNOW THIS IS PUTTING
 TOGETHER A PUZZLE WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE ALL THE PIECES BUT
 JUST KIND OF CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THINKING ON THAT IS NOW. >> SEVERAL QUESTIONS THERE. ONE, IN TERMS OF WHAT IT WOULD
 LOOK LIKE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A VERY, VERY THIN HAZE. IF YOU WERE ON THE SURFACE OF
 PLUTO LOOKING UP YOU PROBABLY WOULD NOT SEE IT. ONLY THROUGH A LONG SHANT IN THE
 ATMOSPHERE AND EVEN THEN ONLY OFF SUNLIGHT SCATTERED THROUGH
 THESE PARTICLES IS HOW WE GET THAT IMAGE. SO A VERY THIN HAZE BUT
 DISTRIBUTED OVER A VERY LARGE REGION. IT APPEARS TO BE LIKE 100 MILES
 OR SO HIGH. IN TERMS OF THE CONVERSION OF
 THOSE PARTICLES TO THOLENS, WE DON'T KNOW THE DETAILS IN THAT. THOSE APPEAR TO BE ALTERED
 HYDROGEN COME POUNDS IRRADIATED AND GONE THROUGH A CHEMICAL
 PROCESS WHERE THE HYDROGEN'S BEEN KICKED OFF. IT'S NOT A PARTICULAR CHEMICAL
 SUBSTANCE. WITHOUT HAVING MORE DETAIL, WE
 CAN'T REALLY TEST THE FACT MECHANISM, BUT WE DO KNOW THAT
 THESE SUBSTANCES ARE AROUND. WE SEE THEM TIGHTENING FOR
 INSTANCE. AND THE REDDISH COLOR IS FAIRLY
 DISTINCTIVE. SO, YEAH, IT'S A PUZZLE WITH
 LOTS AND LOMTS OF PIECES AND THE CHEMISTRY IS CERTAINLY ONE OF
 THOSE PIECES. >> I CAN ADD TO ADDRESS ONE PART
 OF THAT QUESTION THAT THE PERSON WAS ASKING IS THAT I BELIEVE
 THERE WAS ALSO A QUESTION ABOUT THE HAZES FALLING, YOU KNOW,
 UNIFORMLY ON THE SURFACE OF PLUTO. AND THAT PROBABLY DOES HAPPEN. SO WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO
 TO FIGURE OUT THE RATE OF THAT DEPOSITION, BUT THE STORY OF
 SEASONAL TRANSPORT WAS THE ONE THAT I THINK REVEALS WHY WE SEE
 A DISTINCT DIFFERENT PATTERN WITH THESE LATITUDINAL BANDS AND
 THAT HAD TO DO WITH THOSE THOLENS, THEY'RE DARKER, THEY'RE
 GOING TO ABSORB MORE LIGHT, AND SO THE ICES WILL BECOME
 VOLATILIZED, THEY'LL GO FROM A SOLID INTO A GASEOUS PHASE AND
 THEN BE DEPOSITED ON THE POLES AND SO COVER UP, PERHAPS, THE
 THOLENS THAT HAVE BEEN DEPOSITED ON THE NORTHERN POLE. SO ALL THESE PIECES OF THIS
 PUZZLE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER TO UNDERSTAND THE RATE OF
 PRODUCTION OF THOLENS AND THE DEPOSITION OF IT. >> IRENE, DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER
 FOLLOW-UP. >> I DO HAVE ONE KIND OF
 BIG-PICTURE QUESTION THAT MAY BE TOO EARLY TO ANSWER. ALnd, BASED ON THE DATA SO FAR,
 CAN YOU SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE EXACT MASS OF PLUTO AND ANY
 CHANGES IN THE MODELS OF WHAT THE SUPERIOR MAY HAVE? THANKS. >> THANKS, IRENE. I'M GOING TO START THAT AND ASK
 BILL TO CHIP IN AS WELL BECAUSE THIS IS A PARTICULAR AREA OF HIS
 RESEARCH INTEREST. WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN
 A NEW MAP ESTIMATE OF PLUTO, BUT BEFORE THE FLYBY GROUND BASE
 DATA ALREADY GAVE US A VERY ACCURATE MASS. AND IN ORDER TO CONSTRAIN THE
 INTERIOR PROPERTIES, THE PRIMARY UNCERTAINTY WAS IN KNOWING THE
 RADIUS THAT WE CAN GET THE VOLUME AND CONVERT TO A DENLS
 TI. WHAT NEW HORIZONS WAS ABLE TO
 REALLY CONTRIBUTE, EVEN AS WE WERE APPROACHING THE PLANET, WAS
 TO DISCOVER WHAT THE TRUE RADIUS IS. IT'S 1185 OR 186 OR MAYBE 1187
 KILOMETERS. WE'VE COLLAPSED IT TO PLUS OR
 MINUS TWO AND CENTERED AROUND 1,186. THAT WILL LOWER THE DENSITY AND
 HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE INTERIOR PROPERTIES WHICH BILL
 CAN SPEAK TO. >> YEAH. BASICALLY EVERYTHING ALAN SAID
 IS PRETTY MUCH THE CASE. WE HAVE DECENT MASSES FOR PLUTO
 AND COMPANION CHARON AND GOOD SIZES FOR BOTH. IN THE YEARS PAST WE THOUGHT
 THAT CHARON WAS VERY ICY AND PLUTO WAS -- HAD MUCH MORE ROCK
 IN COMPARISON. NOW THE BODIES ARE, IN EFFECT,
 MORE SIMILAR, BUT PLUTO SEEMS TO BE THE ROCKIER WORLD OF THE TWO. THIS WILL GO INTO BUILDING NEW
 MODELS AND TESTING NEW MODELS OF THE EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM. IN TERMS OF WHAT THE INSIDE OF
 PLUTO IS, WITHOUT GRAVITY DATA, IT'S HARD TO BE ABSOLUTELY
 DEFINITIVE. THAT'S KIND OF ONE WAY WE TEST
 OUR MODELS OF PLANETS WHEN WE FLY BY THEM OR ORBIT THEM. BUT EVERYTHING WE SEE, ALL THE
 ACTIVITY WE SEE ON PLUTO IS CONSISTENT WITH THE IDEA THAT IT
 DOES HAVE A MASSIVE ROCK CORE SURROUNDED BY A HUGE ICY SHELL. AND THAT ICY SHELL THEN BY BEING
 A MORE ICY PLANET IS PROBABLY A LITTLE THICKER. ALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL IT
 RAISES THE -- IT INCREASES THE PROBABILITY THAT THERE MAY STILL
 BE AN OCEAN WAY DOWN UNDERNEATH A VERY THICK LAYER OF ICE. THAT'S A THEORETICAL INFERENCE
 RIGHT NOW, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE KEEPING IN MIND AS WE
 EXPLORE PLUTO. ONE OF THE THINGS WE ALSO
 LEARNED, NOT JUST THE SIZE OF PLUTO BUT WE ALSO LEARNED THAT
 IT WAS VERY, VERY CLOSE TO SPHERICAL. WE ACTUALLY CAN'T DETECT ANY
 OBLIQUENESS OR ROUNDNESS IN THE BODY. SOMETIMES YOU RUN AROUND THE
 SOLAR SYSTEM AND LOOK AT THIS SATELLITE OR THAT SATELLITE AND
 THEY'RE VERY DISTORTED. THIS TELLS YOU ABOUT THEIR
 HISTORY. PLUTO PROBABLY WAS SPINNING
 VERY, VERY FAST AFTER WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE A GIANT IMPACT
 THAT LED TO THE FORMATION OF ITS SATELLITE. SO AFTER THIS FORMATION, PLUTO
 AND CHARON ARE VERY CLOSE TOGETHER, MUCH LIKE THE EARTH
 AND THE MOON, AND TIES BETWEEN THE TWO CAUSE THE ORBITS TO
 EXPAND AND THE BODIES SLOW DOWN, AND THEN THEY ARE NOW LOCKED UP
 THE WAY THEY ARE. BUT PLUTO DOESN'T SHOW ANY
 EVIDENCE IN ITS SHAPE FROM THIS EARLY FAST ROTATION. SO WE THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN
 REALLY WARM ENOUGH THAT NO RESIDUAL SHAPE COULD BE
 SUPPORTED. SO IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO SAY
 EXACTLY, YOU KNOW, HOW HOT, OKAY, THAT KIND OF THING, BUT
 THAT'S THE KIND OF THING THAT WE'LL BE APPLYING OUR RESEARCH
 TOOLS, APPLYING OUR THEORETICAL MODELS AND GOING TO SCIENTIFIC
 CONFERENCES AND WRITING SCIENTIFIC PAPERS AND EITHER
 COMING TO CONCLUSIONS OR NOT. THAT'S HOW IT GOES AT TIMES. BUT THINGS ARE LOOKING GOOD FOR
 PLUTO. >> KELLY BEATTIE? >> THANKS VERY MUCH. I WANTED TO ASK, BECAUSE THE
 ATMOSPHERIC DENSITY IS HIGHER THAN YOU'VE EXPECTED IT TO BE,
 I'M WONDERING, I THINK THIS IS FOR MICHAEL PROBABLY, CAN YOU
 TELL US ANYTHING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT ARGON IS
 PLAYING A ROLE IN THE COMPOSITION? >> THE REST MEASUREMENTS SUGGEST
 THE PRESSURE IS ABOUT A FACTOR OF TWO LESS THAN PREVIOUS
 MEASUREMENTS. SO IT'S GONE THE OTHER
 DIRECTION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE ATMOSPHERE
 HAS SHRUNK, TO PUT IT CRUDELY. THAT BY ITSELF I'M NOT SURE SAYS
 ANYTHING ABOUT ARGON. I DON'T BELIEVE AT THIS POINT WE
 HAVE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN SAY ABOUT ARGON. >> NEXT? JASON, SPACE FLIGHT INSIDER. >> THIS ONE GOES OUT TO ALAN. YOU CALLED PLUTO A COUPLE TIMES
 DURING THIS CONVERSATION A DOUBLE PLANET. CONSIDERING THAT PLUTO IS
 LARGER, A LOT MORE DYNAMIC THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, WHAT IS NEW
 HORIZONS FINDING, SAY, IN TERMS OF HOW WE DEFINE WHAT THE PLANET
 ACTUALLY IS? THIS HAS BEEN KIND OF A BONE OF
 CONTENTION WITH THOSE WHO FOLLOWED PLUTO FOR SOME TIME
 NOW. SO IF YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT
 ABOUT THAT, AND THANKS FOR DOING THIS. >> SURE, JASON. NOT SO SIDE TRACK THE
 CONVERSATION BUT, YOU KNOW, WE CALL THE PLUTO SYSTEM A DOUBLE
 PLANET FOR A VERY SPECIFIC TECHNICAL REASON, BECAUSE THE
 TWO OBJECTS ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER AND THEIR MASS RATIO IS
 SUFFICIENT TO DRAW THE BALANCE POINT BETWEEN THEM OUT OF THE
 PRIMARY, OUT OF PLUTO, INTO FREE SPACE BETWEEN. THAT'S EXACTLY ANALOGOUS TO THE
 WAY WE DEFINE A DOUBLE-STAR SYSTEM, WHEN THE BALANCE POINT,
 THE CENTER, IS BETWEEN THE TWO BODIES AND NOT IN THE MORE
 MASSIVE OF THE TWO. THE EARTH/MOON SYSTEM IS ON THE
 BORDER. IT'S NOT QUITE THERE. IN FACT, BALANCE POINT FOR THE
 EARTH/MOON IS DEEP IN THE EARTH'S MANTLE BUT NOT AT THE
 CENTER OF THE EARTH SO IT'S NOT YET MOVED OUT OF THE PLANET BUT
 CLOSE. SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY CONTROVERSY AT ALL ABOUT THE
 DOUBLE-PLANET MONIKER. THERE'S BEEN THIS CONTROVERSY
 WHERE ASTRONOMERS AND PLANETARY SCIENTISTS HAVE LARGELY BEEN ON
 DIFFERENT SIDES OF IT. I THINK THAT YOU AND THE PUBLIC,
 JUST LIKE WE ON THE SCIENCE TEAM, CAN PRETTY WELL TELL WHAT
 WE'RE DEALING WITH. IT'S VERY HARD NOT TO CALL AN
 OBJECT LIKE THIS AT THIS LEVEL OF COMPLEXITY AND ATMOSPHERE
 WITH POTENTIALLY AN INTERNAL OCEAN CERTAINLY WITH COMPLICATED
 SEASONAL CYCLES AND CERTAINLY BIG COMPLICATED SYSTEM OF MOONS
 A PLANET. AND, YOU KNOW, THE WAY SCIENCE
 WORKS IS INDIVIDUAL SCIENTISTS MAKE THEIR DECISIONS ONE AT A
 TIME AND EVENTUALLY CONSENSUS IS REACHED. AND BUT A WE'VE MADE SO MANY
 DISCOVERIES BOTH WITH MISSIONS LIKE KEPPLER THAT DR. GRUNGEFELD
 REFERRED TO OF DIFFERENT KIND OF PLANETS AROUND THE GALAXY AND
 NOW A NEW CLASS OF PLAN NET OUR OWN SOLAR SYSTEM, WE'RE GOING
 THROUGH A PERIOD OF TRANSITION. DEFINITIONS ARE IN TRANSITION AS
 WELL. IT WILL SHAKE ITSELF OUT, BUT
 ONE SCIENTIST AT A TIME UNTIL WE REACH CONSENSUS. >> OKAY. LEO ENRIGHT WILL HAVE THE LAST
 PHONE QUESTION AND THEN SOCIAL MEDIA'S CHOMPING AT THE BIT SO
 WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE PUBLIC AROUND THE WORLD WATCHING THIS
 PROGRAM. LEO? >> OKAY, DUANE. THANKS VERY MUCH. AS DR. McKINNON MENTIONED AN
 OCEAN, I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW THAT MIGHT FIT
 INTO WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. TO PUT IT CRUDELY, COULD YOU SAY
 THE NITROGEN GLACIERS COULD BE EXPLAINED QUITE EASILY WITHOUT A
 LIQUID OCEAN UNDERNEATH AS OTHER MECHANISMS COULD ACHIEVE THIS,
 IS THAT NORGAY AND HILLARY CANNOT BE EXPLAINED WITHOUT
 SOMETHING LIKE THAT? >> I SHOULD BE VERY EXPLICIT. WE DON'T HAVE ANY DIRECT
 EVIDENCE FOR AN INTERIOR LIQUID WATER OCEAN FROM THOSE IMAGES. WHAT I WAS TRYING TO IMPLY IS
 THAT OUR PICTURE OF PLUTO AS A COMPLEXACTIVE WORLD PLUS ANY
 ACTIVE ICE MANTLE ON PLUTO WILL PROBABLY BE DEEPER ON PREVIOUS
 MODELS BASICALLY INCREASES THE THEE RHETT CLAL LIKELIHOOD THERE
 MIGHT STILL BE AN OCEAN DOWN THERE. >> OKAY. SO LET'S SEE WHAT THE SOCIAL
 MEDIA CONVERSATION AND QUESTIONS ARE. EMILY? >> SURE. THIS FIRST QUESTION IS FROM
 DERRICK. AND HE ASKS WHAT INFORMATION IS
 USED TO CREATE THESE FALSE COLOR IMAGES? >> YES. THE INFORMATION COMES FROM OUR
 RALPH INSTRUMENT, AND RALPH IS TWO PARTS. IT HAS A COLOR CAMERA AND
 INVERTED EQUALS SIGN FROM RED SPECTROMETER. THE COLOR IMAGES COME FROM THE
 COLOR CAMERA. WE HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT COLOR
 FILTERS THAT BROADLY A BLUE CHANNEL, A RED CHANNEL, AN ERI
 CHANNEL AND A METHANE CHANNEL. THEY COVER WAVELENGTHS FROM 0.4
 TO 0.9 MICRONS, CHARGE A COUPLE DEVICES ARE TYPICALLY SENSITIVE. AND SO THOSE IMAGES ARE A
 COMBINATION OF THOSE DIFFERENT FILTERS COMBINED AND SOMETIMES
 WE'LL COMBINE THEM TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE NATURAL COLOR AND
 OTHER TIMES WE CREATE FALSE COLOR IMAGE SO THAT YOU CAN PULL
 OUT THOSE WAVELENGTHS LIKE THE NEAR INFRARED THAT'S CLOSER TO.8
 OR.9 MICRONS THAT OUR EYE IS NOT SENSE TOICH SO THAT WE CAN
 UNDERSTAND THESE COMPOSITIONAL UNITS IN THE DETAIL THAT WE
 COULDN'T WITH JUST OUR EYE. >> GREAT. THANK YOU. THIS NEXT QUESTION IS FROM
 LINDA. AND SHE ASKS, THE RING AROUND
 PLUTO IS FROM ITS ATMOSPHERE. WOULD IMAGES OF PLANETS WITHOUT
 ATMOSPHERES BE ABLE TO CAPTURED LIKE THIS? I THINK SHE'S REFERRING TO THE
 BLACK IMAGE. >> I'M SORRY. COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION? >> SURE. THE RING AROUND PLUTO IS FROM
 ITS ATMOSPHERE. WOULD IMAGES OF PLANETS WITHOUT
 ATMOSPHERES BE ABLE TO CAPTURED LIKE THIS? >> IMAGES WITHOUT -- YOU WANT TO
 TAKE THAT? >> YEAH. SURE. WE'VE TAKEN SILHOUETTED IMAGES
 OF OTHER OBJECTS THAT DON'T HAVE ATMOSPHERES AND THEN YOU DON'T
 SEE THE RINGS EXTENDING ABOVE THE SURFACE. IN FACT, WE HAVE A VERY NICE
 IMAGE THAT JUST CAME TO THE GROUND, HASN'T BEEN RELEASED
 YET. THERE ARE SOME OPTICAL ARTIFACTS
 BECAUSE WE'RE LOOKING BACK INTO THE GLARE OF THE SUN. ACTUALLY IT WAS TAKEN ABOUT THE
 SAME TIME, SAME DAY ON THE APPROACH DAY THAT SHOWED THE
 CRESCENT OF PLUTO'S BIG MOON, CHARON. AND THERE'S NO EVIDENCE OF AN
 ATMOSPHERE THERE WHATSOEVER. YOU JUST SEE SORT OF LIKE A
 BRAND-NEW MOON, JUST A THIN CRESCENT OF LIGHT. IT'S QUITE A HAUNTING IMAGE. AND ONCE WE CLEAN IT UP, WE'RE
 GOING TO MAKE SURE IT'S RELEASED. >> LET'S TAKE TWO MORE AND WE'LL
 CLOSE OUT HERE. >> GREAT. THIS QUESTION IS FROM SIMON, AND
 HE SAID IS THERE A THEORY OF WHAT IS DRIVING THE NICE RHO
 GENERAL ICE FLOE AND COULD THE SUN'S LIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE EVEN
 THOUGH IT'S SO FAR AWAY? >> I GUESS THAT'S FOR ME. IT'S NOT SUNLIGHT. IT'S INTERNAL HEAT. IF YOU HAVE A THICK ENOUGH, A
 MASSIVE ENOUGH LAYER OF THESE KIND OF ICES, WHETHER IT BE
 NITROGEN OR CARBON MONOXIDE OR METHANE, IT THIS MOVE. IF THERE'S A SUFFICIENT SLOPE,
 LIT MOVE. IN FACT, WE'VE DONE SOME
 THEORETICAL CALCULATIONS, WHICH OF COURSE WE NEED TO DO BETTER
 ONES, BUT WE BELIEVE ACTUALLY -- I'LL PUT IT THIS WAY. OUR LEADING MODELS FOR THE
 FORMATION OF THE POLYGONS AT THIS MOMENT IS INTERNAL
 CONVECTIVE MOTION RISING AND FALLING AT A SLOW RATE OF THE
 NITROGEN ICE WITHIN THE SPUTNIK PLANUM. AS LONG AS THAT ICE IS AT LEAST
 A HALF A MILE DEEP, WE THINK THIS PROCESS CAN OPERATE. I'LL SAY IT'S DRIVEN FROM THE
 HEAT THAT IT'S LEAKING OUT OF THE INTERIOR OF PLUTO. >> ONE MORE AND GIVE YOU THE
 FINAL ONE, THEN WE CLOSE OUT. >> SURE. THIS LAST QUESTION, WHEN WILL WE
 SEE THE SURFACE OF THE OTHER SIDE OF PLUTO IN RELATIVELY HIGH
 RES? >> WE'VE GOT ABOUT THE BEST
 IMAGES ON THE GROUND ALREADY OF THE OPPOSITE APPROACH
 HEMISPHERE. THE NATURE OF NEW HORIZONS
 EXPLORER SHIP PLUTO DEMANDED THAT WE -- OR WAS CONSEQUENCE
 THAT WE WERE GOING TO OBSERVE ONE HEMISPHERE IN EXQUISITE
 DETAIL AND THE OTHER SIDE IN MUCH LESS DETAIL. THAT'S THE COMBINATION OF OUR
 VERY FAST SPEED COMBINED WITH PLUTO'S SLOW ROTATION RATE OF
 ABOUT 6.4 DAYS. SO THE LAST TIME THAT WE SAW THE
 FAR HEMISPHERE, WE WERE 3.2 DAYS OUT, HALF THAT 6.4 DAYS, AND
 THAT KOR RESPONDED TO ALMOST 3 MILLION MILE ACE WAY. AS OPPOSED TO THE IMAGES YOU'RE
 SEEING WHEN WE'RE ALMOST TEN TIMES CLOSER. NET IS WE HAVE A DICHOTOMY IN
 OUR MAPS. THE FAR SIDE IS NOT IMED AS
 WELL, WE GET THE BASIC PATTERNED AND CAN DETECT POSSIBLY THE
 LARGEST CRATERS ON THE SURFACE AND THE LARGEST UNITS BUT NOT
 NEARLY AS MUCH ON THE CLOSE APPROACH HEMISPHERE. THAT SAID, WE HAVE A GOOD BIT OF
 IMAGERY IN THE SPACECRAFT THAT WILL HELP US IMPROVE FAR SIDE
 MAP A LITTLE MORE. IN THE FALL WHEN THOSE DATA
 START TO COME TO THE GROUND, WE'LL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE A
 BETTER MAP OF THAT FAR SIDE THAN WE HAVE NOW. >> THANKS. >> ERIC, ""SCIENCE"" MAGAZINE
 AGAIN. ATMOSPHERIC QUESTION FOR ALAN OR
 MIKE. THIS SHRINKING ATMOSPHERE, THIS
 PLUMMETING PRESSURE, ASSUMING THAT IF IT GOT TO ZERO THAT
 MEANS THAT THE ATMOSPHERE FROZE OUT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU GOT
 THERE IN THE NICK OF TIME AND THAT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE
 PLUTO IS HEADING, TOWARD THE FREEZEOUT? AS A FOLLOW-UP TO THAT, HOW CAN
 YOU RECONCILE A SHRINKING ATMOSPHERE WITH DETECTING HAZE
 MUCH HIGHER THAN WAS EXPECTED? SEEMS A LITTLE CONTRADICTORY. A SHRINKING ATMOSPHERE WITH A
 HIGHER HAZE. >> I'LL TALK ABOUT THE HAZE
 FIRST. THE HAZE PARTICLES ARE EXTREMELY
 SMALL. AND THEY'RE VERY BUOYANT. THEY CAN STAY UP IN AN
 ATMOSPHERE. THEY CAN STAY SUSPENDED IN AN
 ATMOSPHERE THAT'S VERY, VERY DENSE. BUT YOU COULD HAVE THE -- JUST
 PULLING NUMBERS OUT OF THE AIR RIGHT HERE, BUT YOU COULD HAVE
 THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE DECREASED BY A FACTOR OF TEN AND
 YOU COULD STILL HAVE A HAZE PRESENT IN THE ATMOSPHERE. YOU COULD SUSPEND LESS BUT IT
 COULD STILL BE THERE. IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THE OTHER
 PART, I'LL LET YOU. >> SURE. SURE. WELL, YOU KNOW, FOR A LONG TIME
 THERE HAVE BEEN ATMOSPHERIC MODELS AND CLIMATE MODELS FOR
 PLUTO THAT SUGGESTED THAT AS PLUTO DRAWS AWAY FROM THE SUN
 THAT THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE COULD PRECIPITOUSLY DROP. AND IN FACT DURING THE TIME WHEN
 THE NATIONAL ACADEMY AND OTHER COMMITTEES WERE LOOKING AT
 FLYING A PLUTO MISSION AND IT RELATIVE PRIORITY, THERE WAS A
 REAL INTEREST IN TRYING TO GET TO PLUTO WHILE IT STILL HAD A
 SUBSTANTIAL ATMOSPHERE. THAT HELPED MOTIVATE THE CASE
 FOR WHY TO GET A MISSION LAUNCHED IN THE 2000s VERSUS
 WAITING BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GET THERE WHILE THERE WAS STILL AN
 ATMOSPHERE TO STUDY. EVENTUALLY THERE CAME TO BE SORT
 OF A BELIEF THAT IT'S BEEN 25 OR MORE YEARS SINCE PLUTO
 APPROACHED THE SUN. MAYBE THERE WON'T BE ANY
 ATMOSPHERE. WHAT REX SEEMS TO HAVE DETECTED
 IS A POTENTIAL FOR THE FIRST STAGES OF THAT COLLAPSE JUST AS
 NEW HORIZONS ARRIVED. IT WOULD BE AN AMAZING
 COINCIDENCE, BUT THERE ARE SOME ON OUR TEAM THAT WOULD SAY I
 TOLD YOU SO. SO WE'LL SEE IF THIS IS, IN
 FACT, WHAT'S HAPPENING OR FIT'S A MORE COMPLICATED STORY PERHAPS
 NOT RELATED, MAYBE SOME OTHER POSSIBILITIES. AS MIKE SAID, IT'S EARLY DAYS. WE HAVE SEVERAL MORE REX DATA
 SETS TO COME TO THE GROUND THAT WILL HELP INFORM THIS QUESTION
 BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY GOT DATA FROM TWO DIFFERENT STATIONS AT
 INGRESS AND TWO DIFFERENT STATIONS AT EGRESS, AND WE ONLY
 HAVE ONE OF THOSE FOUR AND ONLY PART OF THAT DATA SET. SO THIS IS AN UNFOLDING STORY. >> SO THAT'S GOING TO DO IT
 HERE. AS YOU HEARD TODAY, PLUTO IS
 VERY COMPLEX WORLD. AS DR. STERN MENTIONED, THE DATA
 IS RAINING DOWN, AND WE WILL BE BRINGING YOU MORE IN THE FUTURE. STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ON THE
 CADENCE OF HOW WE WILL PRESENT THAT AND SHARE WIT THE MEDIA AND
 THE PUBLIC AND THE WORLD. AND, AGAIN, FOLLOW US ON THE
 NASA SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNTS, TWITTER, FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE. SEND IN THOSE QUESTIONS, KEEP
 THEM COMING IN. WE'LL GET THEM ANSWERED WITH THE
 SCIENCE TEAM AT #ASKNASA. AND FOLLOW THE CONVERSATION,
 THIS CONVERSATION WILL GO ON FOR A LONG TIME. #PLUTOFLYBY. AGAIN, UPDATES AND ANY OTHER
 TYPE OF INFORMATION COMING DOWN IN THE FUTURE,
 WWW.NASA.GOV/NEWHORIZONS. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE TEAM. HAVE A GREAT, GREAT WEEKEND. AND THIS TEAM IS NOT REWRITING

rather nondescript series of warehouses just outside straddling Gloucestershire there's a flag with an e and a spark on it and wonder what it's all about oh look at that that's nice I don't know what that is what's this so this is going to be possibly the world's first high performance high powered pure electric sport race aircraft right a technology demonstrator to show what high powered electric propulsion can do for aerospace so this is Joe this isn't an actual flying plane this what we have done it this is a full-sized engineering model so one two clock back a bit about five and a half six years ago I've been keeping an eye on what's been happening in the electric motor and battery world and also model aeroplanes people have been using electric motors by propulsion for years and years a long time and it's just that it's become viable the the power density of batteries because obviously with aircraft weight is quite critical and also the the architecture electric motors that will start to be made and thinking actually they could be adapted for for aerospace and prior to this I got involved with Red Bull Air racing and as much as doing some performance enhancement work and was privileged to go to quite a few races around the world and the time through the track the average time through the racetrack of Red Bull Air Race is about 90 seconds Wow you know a lightbulb went on I thought oh hang on a minute if we did a technology demonstrator that can stay in the air for five or ten minutes yeah and show what can be done with with high powered electric in a bit quite game-changing and looking at the automobile industry where you put electric propulsion in a car you get zero mission zero noise pretty much and a huge amount of torque you put that in an airplane and you get more you get all three things but the fact that electric motors aren't attitude sensitive so aerobatic and that connoisseur they're not prone to shop cooling so a lot of these aircrafts hydrocarbon engines they get quite hot and if you want to come down quickly over cooling can crack they you know cause a lot of problems and also electric motors don't require oxygen so you can go to far higher altitude and also as you're gaining altitude you don't have to keep adjusting the mixture control if it's a hydrocarbon engine the battery technology is changing quickly I mean it's not only the power density of the batteries but also the ability to charge them because I remember when I bought my first battery drill 20 years ago it would take 8 hours overnight to charge up and then the next morning get about three minutes yes it looks like I'll go three holes that's a hot and you know that's it but now the time to charge a battery is pretty much the same as the time to discharge it right I mean presumably then the actual capacity of the batteries you've got in here into in comparison with a road-going car it's fairly small because you get you need a lot of power for very cheap yeah what's really exciting is the architecture of electric motors allow us to do this contra-rotating system right so it noticed this so these these turn in opposite direction so they'll they'll all go that way Wow so briefly then explain why you would want that because that makes absolutely - somebody doesn't understand anything about aeronautics that makes no sense it sounds like it's going to be chopping the air up and called yeah so if you go back to the Second World War as the war progressed the engines were getting more and more powerful and to absorb that power the propellers got bigger and bigger and if you give an example overlay the side profile of a mark 1 Spitfire over the last market I think it was a 22 mark 22s got a longer fuselage and a bigger fin to accommodate a more powerful engine with a bigger propeller and you have to raise the undercarriage and and then towards the end of the war some bright sparks thought well hang on a minute if we put a gear box on the front of our Merlin or Griffin engine and we drive two propellers we can reduce the diameter but still get the power absorbed and the for us the other thing it does is it counteracts the torque effect because if you can imagine you're turning one big propeller pilots had to be very careful you couldn't open the throttle quickly on a Spitfire or a high-powered fighter you had to feed the power in slowly until you got speed and you had rudder Authority Authority you needed air going over the rocks you don't need dirige otherwise if you just went like that it would it would just spin around yeah you'd be facing the hangar all the hedge or yeah so yes it counteracted the talk so effectively you could go right like that so they can take off faster yes so the reason for doing this then is because you're getting you're basically getting far more pull from these two if you just had one electric motor and one bigger propeller yeah you'd have less well if we have one mode with one propeller the propeller would be a larger diameter this airplane would have to be a lot bigger raised undercarriage longer and it's just it's just the fact that we can do this contra-rotating system that allows us to put this huge amount of power in the small airframes at the moment the calculator figures coming out with the airframe and the most when the propeller design is coming out at just over 300 miles an hour for this size this will be up there with the hydrocarbon racing aeroplane so it's certainly on a part and it's not is the petrol ones do 500 miles an hour and you might get to 300 this you're absolutely neck-and-neck with that so so for this size because when you see a little you know two-seater type of GE going over the house that's doing a hundred miles now everyone I mean they're not going that fast yeah so this is quick this will be quick if I'm parked on the end of a runway with a modern frontline fighter whether it's a typhoon or tornado and we both hit the start button at the same time I think we'd be somewhere around about 20,000 feet and climbing before they caught up they soon leave us behind right but it's the fact that with electric it's instant you know you don't you know with the jet modern jet aircraft it takes about two and a half minutes to scramble because they've got a white spool up the engine they've got to get the hydraulics and the core temperature and thing and once that's all and then they can go but electric instant I've come off the back of them working in automotive industry for last sort of five or six years specializing in hybrid and electric power trains so I've been really lucky to sort of see the industry through the boom years so back when I started when I was sort of eighteen straight out of school I worked for an electric motor company and there we were building our own prototype cars and electric cars were a very new concept and since then I've worked for a couple of companies her McLaren and Jaguar Land Rover and now we see cars like the tester on the road and it's fantastic to see how quickly it's all progressed and in that time I was sort of working at becoming an aerobatic pilot and that's something I do now I've always had a passion for aviation I've been looking at it's amazing technology and I work in my day job and they're not going to fly behind a 50 year old internal combustion engine and it just didn't seem it just didn't seem very natural so this is another mock-up of the this is a little bit different to the other one so the other ones designs obviously look good it shows the constant because this is actually what we call a space frame allocation model so what enables us to do is take our concept and work out we're actually going to put the components so where we're going to put our motors and our batteries and stuff like that so we'll just take the what would be sort of the engine cover off right yes that more than one yes I so what we have here is a mock-up of two electric motors that we looking at using they bolted together and you can see they're nice it's a nice small compact tiny isn't it it's all orange inside yes I see yes a um for some weight comparisons this whole unit is going to weigh somewhere in the region of between 50 55 kilograms whereas the equivalent of an equivalent power in terms of internal combustion you're looking at 150 to 200 kilograms so it's yes I usually this magnitude difference and it's that light weight powerplant that enables this whole concept to work really well so you can see straight away behind this we've got a nice space to put our battery so that's what the batteries that go here is what comes I'll be down the back we don't want to hell back on earth I see yes I centre of gravity is all quite critical with an aeroplane as I said coming off the back of working in automotive I've seen the technology mature really where or so I understand that we don't actually need to reinvent the wheel here because at the moment all of the technology we're using currently exists within the automotive world and we're just repurposing it and putting it in a crazy airframe and we're going to try and break some records very fast yeah crazy fast yeah so Steve now I'm hearing that you're going to be the first person that will fly this aircraft once it's made yeah I mean I've got a sort of history of sort of high performance little airplanes sporting aeroplanes racing and aerobatics and that's really what attracted me to this it looks like a fairly conventional high-performance light aeroplane but when they told me that it could have 300 horsepower in the front a little tiny thing like this that's what really got my foot more interest yes mazing amazing because I have no idea where for instance the the Red Bull aerobatic plane I went in with Nigel what I don't know what horsepower that had offer a clue what seemed very powerful and fast yeah and indeed it would have been it's about 300 horsepower no zero place so that is what 300 horsepower does in a plane Oh Lord no I understand because it's very hard to judge you know what that would actually mean that is terrifying indeed but a few things that airplane you went in had you and knowledge or I'm quite a big airframe and still perform very well this is just one person in the smallest possible area should go like help right goodness me so this is the we're looking at the the cockpit which presumably is relatively similar to to a racing plane anyway I mean it the presumably the actual air surface controls that's the same that's not different no that's right it's a relatively conventional airplane it's a albeit made in completely carbon-fiber so very light very strong and but yeah the cockpit is conventional the only difference is really are we have two throttles because we're running two two motors at the front and two big off buttons because it's still a test airplane so we might need the big local signals and the other thing which is is certainly unique to a little racing aeroplane is this red handle here which if it's pulled activates what's called the ballistic recovery system which is big rocket in the back here ours out of there with a parachute which brings the whole airplane going on Wow so if something goes really wrong you don't have to get out and use your own parachute no lanes got a parachute because that's the good thing about this is it's being tested in larger aircraft in the States but it's never been fitted to a little airplane others because of course if you do like the RAF style thing or the military thing of bailing out your airplane you don't know where it's going to go right it's an unmanned airplane it you know it could hurt somebody so this the idea this is that you pull that the whole thing comes down at a rate that the pilot in the aircraft survived right and it comes down at a slow speed and pretty much directly wait below where you start from there so so if you're right underneath you got time to go oh look let's go the other way while we were visiting Elektra flight we couldn't resist having a look at how they make the propellers these are made in a workshop next door run by a different company but they make beautiful propellers mostly for old classic planes but in this case they're making them for the Elektra flight now you'd think with a modern plane like this with electric motors and batteries and the latest technology make them out of carbon fiber or 3d printed titanium alloy powder but no they make them out of wood lots of bits of wood glued together and then turned on a CNC machine that's completely computer control and really really cool and then they spray them they're made of wood we've got a good advantage that in many ways the the model making world is several steps ahead of us and we've actually got one model here which is a lovely lovely illustration we have one propeller going around that way we've got the show and the other propeller going the other way this is what we mean by contra-rotating why we're so excited with the possibilities of electric motors is we can take two small very high power electric motors and we can actually back-to-back them so you can see in this arrangement so that is the two motors there right that's right and we got what they call shaft wooden shaft so the the back motor is actually driving the the front propeller right and vice versa then the front motor is driving the back propeller right so these are this is a test fit but one's going to go one way one's going to go the other and then you move them together and see what happens that's exactly right huh and I'll do that in a second but just to explain the idea of the design yeah that the first thing you've just said we keep this one fixed right but we can move them in and out right so you see in that position it's beginning to look more like them or like that yeah but is that the best position we don't know right should they be perhaps they're right or there yeah so it's the sort of thing we can experiment with but we've also got each motor mounted on these little blue units here and lovely bit of engineering in that they show us how much power the motors are drawing right give the vaults and the amps but also this part is what called a load so it's actually measuring how much time are us right and by having one individual load cells we can measure the the the thrust of each motor and then see what the combined effect is okay well the first thing we do Robert is these very high power so you've obviously got some glasses got some eye protection that's good I'll put these on Rogers to be on the safe side okay so we're now ready to go right and so if I just ask you sound a little bit better okay I'll start this motor first so you come over here oh my goodness I thought it to be you know that's not you've barely turned it up so that that's right so that's that's now running and we start the other one undo the locking nuts and very gently we can bring them up propellers pushing the edge will swing out this is something and this is actually quite a low power setting right so if I lock that down there which simulates your contra tating if you like to come stand behind me well we'll put one power up first it's just that is so sorry because it was actually broke but because it says little morning I'm thinking model airplanes II and a little bit of roof and it would fly a little plane that is for the scale of it what's coming off that is ridiculous so and also you could I could really feel when you turn the first one up I felt an increase but when you turned up the second one up then it was really intense so that's it I really feel a doubling of the power coming out of it but it's a lovely idea and electric really takes it forward where it was it was slightly parked with the development of the jet engine and this is why partly why we're so excited about it but that is enough what you've been feel is that then the notion of a larger airplane that doesn't necessarily have the performance of this but has the power to get a fairly heavy machine off the ground our goal I would believe that you know a couple of those on the wings and you've got an enormous amount of thrust from that well again you're absolutely right but even take it a stage further and one of the exciting things for the big boy developers is they're saying we can radically rethink the shape of large aircraft and your example just said putting on the wings at the moment there's a lot of aircraft perhaps take up to 20 passengers they've got one propeller on each wing two angels we could combine them into one contra tating units on the nose you then clean the wings and you make you get a more efficient airframe right so if you can't still get these extra benefits at every turn you you"
moonlanding,"If you thought we sent Apollo to the purely to explore the moon and do the science then think again. 
Apollo was primarily a political tool for Kennedy to use against the Soviets. In this episode, we find out the real reasons why we stopped going to the moon.

 anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landings, since then just 12 men have
 walked on the lunar surface in six missions covering a period lasting less
 than three years. The Apollo project at its peak employed over 400,000 people in
 some 20,000 businesses and universities with a total cost adjusted to 2018
 figures of around about a $145 Billion so after all
 the work money invested why did our interest in it drop like a stone in a
 vacuum and what were the real reasons why we stopped going to the moon. Today Apollo is seen as a groundbreaking
 episode in our scientific understanding and technological abilities, in just over
 60 years we've gone from the first powered flight of the Wright brothers to
 Neil Armstrong stepping onto the lunar surface. Apollo was not only the 
 culmination of the space race but it was also the last great manned adventure in
 a century where we'd climbed the highest mountains, gone to the deepest parts of
 the oceans and explored the farthest reaches of the earth. As time goes by the
 approval rating of the Apollo missions have gradually increased in 1979
 41% of people in an NBC poll said that Apollo was worth it by
 1999 twenty years later it was 55%. In an increasingly uncertain
 world the mystique of Apollo and our nostalgic look back at this period of
 history when anything seemed possible has only been heightened by the recent
 loss of some of those original pioneers like Neil Armstrong the first man on the
 moon and Gene Cernan the last man on the moon but it wasn't always this way
 in fact at the time when Apollo was championed by President Kennedy many
 scientists were opposed to it saying but it would divert money from other
 projects the top military were opposed to it because it would take away many of
 the best scientists from working on aerospace and missile technology and
 community leaders were opposed because they believed the huge amount of money
 would be better spent on education poverty and the healthcare. There are
 many reasons as to why we stopped going to the moon the increasing involvement
 in Vietnam from 1968 to 75 and the budget cuts that followed, the gradual thawing of the Cold War and the growing belief that money could be better spent
 here on earth Rather than in space but there are two reasons which trumped all the
 others and to find out what those were you have to go back to Kennedy's speech
 to Congress in May 1961 and the circumstances under which he made it.
 In November 1960 John F Kennedy had been elected president of the USA at a time
 when the Soviets had been achieving impressive milestones in space. They
 had taken the lead with Sputnik in 1957 the first satellite to orbit the Earth.
 They'd orbited the moon and photographed its far side with Luna 3 in 1959 and
 then on the 12th of April 1961 to top it all off they put the first man into
 orbit Yuri Gagarin. All this was a huge propaganda success for the Soviets and
 to many of the American public and those in the West it really did seem like the
 US was losing the space race and by default the Battle of ideologies even
 though Alan Shepard became the first American in space just three weeks later.
 Kennedy had to do something so on the 20th of April 1961 he sent a memo to
 vice president lyndon b johnson asking him to see what space programs could
 allow the u.s. to catch up and overtake the soviets after meeting with NASA. He
 came back a week later with three suggestions all based on using the early
 Apollo program. Apollo had been conceived in 1960 under Eisenhower as a follow-on
 to Project Mercury but would carry three astronauts rather than Mercury's one and
 have much larger rocket stages which would later become the saturn v with a
 range that would extend as far as the moon but at the time it still didn't
 have any well-defined goals. The first of the proposals was to build an orbital
 space station but NASA believed the Soviet leading heavy rockets would mean
 they would be able to achieve that in the not-too-distant future.
 The second was a manned orbit around the moon again this was believed to be a
 goal which the Soviets could also do. They had already orbited the moon with their unmanned the Luna 3 probe so it wouldn't be a massive
 leap for them to make a manned mission. The third option was a
 manned mission to land on the moon this was something but NASA thought the
 Soviets would have a problem doing and they had showed no signs of wanting to
 do. It was also far enough off into the future but it would be likely that the
 US will be able to achieve it first. Kennedy was initially skeptical of a
 manned moon landings due to the huge price tag which was estimated to be nine
 billion dollars for the next five years up to 1966 in 2018 money bets around
 about 70 billion dollars but it was the only option that would have the prestige
 and the impact that Kennedy was looking for, it was big and it was bold and it
 would send a signal to the world that America was the preeminent leader in
 space and technology. Although it's believed by many that Kennedy was a big
 supporter of space and that this was the reason for the Apollo initiative, in a
 transcript of a meeting between himself and the NASA Administrator James Webb in April 1962 which was released in 2001 he clearly states that he is not really
 that interested in space he's only doing it because of the
 progress of the Soviets and Yuri Gagarin's flight just a few weeks
 earlier. It's also been suggested but it was to help make up for the humiliation
 of the disastrous U.S backed invasion of Cuba at the Bay of Pigs which also
 happened under his administration. And so when he made his speech to Congress on
 May 25th 1961 and said the following ""I believe that this nation should commit
 itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the
 moon and returning him safely to the earth""
 he quite literally meant one man. The mission would be to get a single
 astronaut to land on the moon, plant the US flag and then come back home. To
 Kennedy, Apollo was a political decision to achieve a political goal this was to
 demonstrate to the rest of the world and those developing nations that were still
 struggling with their future political paths that the
 technological and organizational power of the United States and therefore
 democratic capitalism was superior to soviet-style communism. Although this was an out-and-out race to beat the Soviets Kennedy tried to back out of his
 commitment by offering to share the moon mission with the Soviets twice, once in a
 private meeting with Nikita Khrushchev in June 1961 and again in the United
 Nations speech in September of 1963 but they declined the offer and after
 Kennedy's death the proposal was dropped by both sides. It would take the Soviets
 a further three years before they took their own moon mission seriously and by
 then they'd fallen well behind and the technical challenges of the N1 rocket
 would delay and ultimately end their manned lunar ambitions. Over time Apollo
 was fleshed out from a single manned landing to a series of ten although
 after Kennedy's assassination it became almost a living memorial to him. Even
 after the Apollo 1 disaster that killed the three crew as they were doing a
 pre-flight test there was the determination to carry on and keep his
 vision alive. This also highlighted the danger that the mission could fail in
 some way they were quite litterally flying into the unknown. Although most of
 her systems had been tested and previous missions had been flown around the moon
 the development of the lunar lander was taking much longer than expected and the
 landing of Apollo 11 and the ascent back from the lunar surface was something
 that could not be simulated accurately on earth, if something went wrong at that
 point there was the very real danger that the crew would be stranded on the
 moon. This set up Apollo 11 as the grand finale of the space race between the
 U.S. and the Soviets with all the nail-biting moments right up until the
 end. Although the Soviets tried to upstage
 Apollo by landing a remote-controlled lunakhod rover on the moon in February
 of 1969 the rocket failed at launch but this was kept a secret for many years
 and it would be February 1970 when the replacement Lunakhod caught one officially landed. But Apollo 11 did make it to the moon and after the crew landed and
 planted the u.s. flag on the lunar surface, they stayed for a total of 21
 hours and 36 minutes before setting off and returning home safely. And that was
 it, the race was won, the US had done it, they
 beaten the Soviets and they landed a man or in this case two on the moon and
 return them safely back home just as Kennedy had stated of Congress back in
 1961. Although there were nine more Apollo missions in the pipeline Apollo
 11 was the main goal, all the missions after it were effectively filling in the
 missing pieces to do the science and making use of a massive infrastructure
 and investment but had been made to get Apollo 11 to the lunar surface.
 However because Apollo was a political project to showcase the power of the US
 and the free market system there was no plan to carry the science on and
 colonize the moon or make a permanent lunar outpost or even return to the moon.
 In fact like so many other major events which have happened since there was no
 grand plan of what would happen after the initial Apollo missions. This rather
 ill-defined conclusion to Apollo was pointed out at a time but no one that
 the highest levels took much in the way of any action. After the initial
 adulation dies down the apathy sets in even though there are more missions
 planned, a kind of been there, seen it, done it type of attitude becomes
 prevalent amongst the public. What was front page news around the world is
 relegated to the back pages or not even reported in many countries, interest from
 both the public and the government drops dramatically and the knives are out for
 NASA as budget cuts become ever deeper. By January 1970 and after Apollo 12 NASA
 announced but it would trim back 50,000 more jobs from its 190,000 strong
 workforce and that was less than half of its 1960
 high of 400,000. Apollo 20 would be canceled and it's Saturn 5 would be used
 to launch Skylab itself made from the upper stages of a Saturn 5 rocket. Out of
 all the following missions only Apollo 13 really stands out but for all the
 wrong reasons because it brought back the drama of
 will they or won't they make it. There were calls to end the program after
 Apollo 13 but NASA didn't want to go out on a failure so it was announced that
 they will be cutting out missions 18 and 19 and condensing their most important
 goals into Apollo 17 which would become the last one. With this ending NASA was
 left in a strange place, Skylab was a stopgap measure to make a space station
 but using leftover Saturn 5 parts and the shuttle was all that was left of a
 space transportation system that would have taken men back to the moon and on
 to Mars. It would now be for low-earth orbit missions only basically it will be
 a space truck moving men and equipment to and from orbit but neither Skylab or
 the shuttle had that wow factor of the Apollo 11 mission. The much hoped for
 giant leap for mankind will be limited to a few hundred miles above the earth
 and as such we no longer needed with giant rockets capable of returning to
 the moon all the infrastructure to build and launch them. The moon became a
 footnote in space history for the next 50 plus years as robotic probes took
 over the job for exploring the solar system. It's only in the last few years
 that we've seen anything that resembles those ambitious goals of the 1960s but
 even then they are on a scale much smaller than before and so it's with
 some irony that the publication The Economist pointed out that Apollo was
 the program chosen to take on the Soviets to prove that the free market system of
 the US was better than the centralized government control of the Soviets and
 yet it took a massive amount of American public resources, money and
 centralized government organization to achieve it. So were we right to leave a
 moon after Apollo or should we have continued maybe with Soviet and other
 foreign cooperation like we have done with the International Space Station, let
 me know in the comments and also why not check out some of our other videos if

As brave space explorers, astronauts have to tolerate their bones weakening and their eyes changing but no one expected they would see ghostly lights or hear otherworldly music in space. Even stranger is the chilling stories of exploding objects, space eels, and strange spacecraft caught on NASA footage. These NASA secrets are just as weird as the things astronauts did on purpose, like bringing contagious bacteria into space and turning it into super bacteria or lighting a fire to see what burned. Of course, who can forget the strange UFOs caught on camera in space. See all these and more in this video of 25 strange things that have happened in space.

mysteries we want to unlock so it makes sense strange things might happen there since the earliest days of space exploration astronauts and scientists have experienced and discovered some pretty bizarre phenomena from UFOs to bizarre lights there have been plenty of accounts of strange things occurring in the cold vacuum of space what are they where do they come from how do we explain it many of these questions scientists have been trying to get to the bottom of curious to hear about these odd incidents well I'm Mike with lists 25 and here are 25 strange things that have happened in space 25 a knock was heard in a Chinese spacecraft and no one could explain it Chinese tycoon uh Yang Liwei was the first man China sent to space on the shenshu five during his twenty one hour mission he said he heard a strange knocking noise like someone was hitting the body of the spaceship he tried to figure out what would cause it but found nothing no solid explanation has been given but some believe it could have been the spacecraft expanding and contracting in space 24 NASA astronaut story Musgrave saw space heels when NASA astronaut story Musgrave was in space he claims to have seen eel-like tubes with her own propulsion systems apparently he saw these creatures twice while most shrug it off as space junk Musgrave stood by his statement 23 Apollo astronauts claimed to see strange flashes of light many astronauts from the Apollo 11 mission and Beyond have claimed to see strange flashes of light they said they saw the flashes even when their eyes were closed and described them as white blue or yellow scientists believe the astronauts were being hit by cosmic rays Fantastic Four here we come 22 astronaut witnessed a strange orange light on the ISS it was ESA astronaut samantha christopher nandi's first time flying up to the International Space Station when she approached she saw the Space Station glow as strange blood orange becoming quite excited by the sight she called it alien 21 major Gordon Cooper claimed to have seen a green orb in space as part of the Mercury missions major Gordon Cooper orbited the earth in his mercury capsule during his mission he claimed to have seen the green orb approaching him before disappearing even a tracking station in Moochie Australia picked up the signal 20 NASA purposely ignited a fire on the International Space Station obviously the last thing you'd want to have is a fire in your spacecraft however NASA decided to light a fire in space on purpose it was an elaborate experiment to understand how flames work in space the results well for one the flames are blobby and spherical the flames also follow the ventilation system that of just rising up as they do here on planet earth scientists are planning to conduct further experiments to learn more about how fire spread how quickly and which materials pose large threats to astronauts 19 astronauts took bacteria for a ride in space living organisms change after being sent to space bacteria is no exception astronaut Cheryl Nicholson brought Salmonella up into space and kept it for 11 days upon its return to Earth researchers quickly infected mice with the Salmonella to see how they'd react normally mice infected would die in seven days but the ones infected with the space Salmonella died two days earlier from lower doses similar experiments have been done to other bacteria but results have been unpredictable and inconclusive there's really no telling how these microorganisms will change and what impact that change could have upon returning to Earth 18 Apollo 10 heard weird music as they orbited the moon as they orbited the far side of the moon Apollo 10 heard what they called outerspace type music at the time they were cut off from Houston and alone for a brief period the astronauts didn't mention it to Mission Control but years later a low-frequency whistling noise came up on their recordings 17 Neil Armstrong may have seen extraterrestrials on the moon this one you can take with a grain of salt but reportedly Neil Armstrong sent a secret message to NASA claiming to have seen extraterrestrials of the secret report Armstrong said they're on the other side of the Moon watching us it should be mentioned Armstrong never confirmed any of this 16 puzzling and mysterious flashes of light from space can't be explained by astronomers discovered in 2007 scientists have noted mysterious flashes of light called fast radio bursts which only last for a few milliseconds strangely they don't really know what they are or what's causing them theories abound including neutron stars collapsing black holes or even aliens 15 astronauts that spend a lot of time in space grow taller one of the strange effects of being in space for a long period of time is apparently growing taller due to the zero gravity the spinal cord isn't compressed as much making astronauts grow at least 3% taller 14 a cataclysmic event took place ten point seven billion light years from Earth while we sit comfortably in our galaxy we may forget that the universe as a whole can be a scary place for instance scientists recently discovered a sudden burst of x-ray light ten point seven billion light-years away from Earth they believed it was likely some kind of destructive cataclysmic event the energy it produced was a thousand times more powerful than all the stars in our galaxy they aren't really sure what it was or what caused it at all 13 Russian cosmonauts saw something the size of a finger outside a space station while working on the Salyut 6 russian cosmonaut major-general vladimir kovalyonok saw an orbiting object outside that was the size of a finger while he was watching it and trying to figure out what it was it suddenly exploded and split into the then two golden objects disappeared once they entered the Earth's shadow 12 the Milky Way has had quite the cannibalistic past using the Hubble Space Telescope NASA discovered the strange act of galactic cannibalism by our own galaxy the Milky Way they studied 13 stars on the Milky Way's outer halo to get a better understanding of how the Milky Way formed over the years they believed the Milky Way grew larger by basically eating smaller galaxies 11 a strange UFO hit shuttle Atlantis on the sts-115 mission during the sts-115 mission a small UFO orbited and hit the shuttle Atlantis the astronauts on the mission ran tests to make sure they weren't in danger NASA shrugged it off as benign and possibly flying debris or ice of course some claim it was a cover-up and something else happened they don't want us to know about 10 Leroy Chiao saw strange beams of light coming as if from nowhere while up in space NASA astronaut Leroy Chiao said he saw five lights from the opposite direction of the Sun and was in awe at the site saying he couldn't really explain what they were where they came from he said they flew by quickly in an orderly formation with the exception of a second one investigators have tried to solve the mystery theorizing they were potentially light shining from Earth nine distant quasar is holding a giant reservoir of water about 12 billion light years away a quasar is holding a huge reservoir of water hundred and forty trillion times the mass of water in the Earth's oceans while finding water in space isn't itself unique this one is particularly remarkable and strange for how much water it's produced eight scott kelly tweeted a photo of space with a strange UFO in the corner nasa astronaut scott kelly occasionally would tweet photos of space and in one particular case he tweeted a photo of india however off in the right hand corner there's a strange-looking pair of prominent white lights internet sleuths immediately trying to claim it as a UFO no one really knows for sure what it is it could be an alien or maybe just a smudge seven after long missions in space astronauts eyes become deformed astronauts who have stayed up in space for longer than a month may want to get their eyes checked a new study showed that these astronauts have deformities in their eyes optic nerves and pituitary glands the problems arise from intracranial hypertension a condition where pressure pushes on the brain and skull six a Millennium Falcon shaped object caught on an ISS live video feed while watching the live ISS feed Jaden Beeson saw something rather strange to him it was a pair of lights that looked like it was in the shape of the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars he took a screenshot and sent it to NASA wanting an explanation they've not responded five our solar system had a ninth planet that at one time got away astronomers have come upon new evidence that a ninth planet the size of Neptune was once in the planet-forming region of our solar system but what's eventually kicked out into the elliptical orbit it takes 15,000 years for this planet to fully orbit the Sun it's the planet that got away for a bizarre UFO was filmed by russian cosmonaut musa Mannoroth in march 1991 russian cosmonaut lucemon roth filmed a bizarre UFO sighting from the MIR space station a capsule was docking nearby and in the footage a weird white object is visible in the distance he doesn't believe it to be space junk as others have claimed three NASA cut their live feed right when a UFO came into view On January 15th 2015 while NASA was showing a live feed of the International Space Station a strange UFO came into view off in the distance just above Earth right when it came into view NASA mysteriously cut their live feed what was the object and why would NASA try to hide it two astronauts also lose bone mass while spending too much time in space of the things that might get affected by prolonged living in space bones might not first come to mind but in fact astronauts lose bone mass if they stay too long in space bones are active living tissue and rebuild themselves from physical activity like walking or running when that's removed from zero gravity the bones begin to weaken one living bacteria was discovered outside the International Space Station it's generally men believed living organisms can't survive the cold vacuum of space but recently astronauts discovered living bacteria outside the International Space Station taken from swamps the material was absent during the launch of the module it's led some to claim it's the first proof of alien life but the astronauts think there's a likely explanation rising air currents can carry the bacteria up in Earth's upper atmosphere where it can

moonlanding, ,The truth behind the moon landings,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9FtQCtlyJU,0,1638737,0,0,0,p9FtQCtlyJU,"it remains one of the greatest conspiracy theories of all time born an era of global political suspicions did the Apollo astronauts really land on the moon because they knew successful trips to the moon and returns could not be made they were producing a production a showpiece if you will those close to the missions have nothing but contempt for the skeptics there is no sir science is so complete this point is wrong argument these hoax conspiracy propagators are doing a tremendous disservice to the young people of our future any ideas leading host is quite frankly insane to test the evidence underpinning the hoax theories we've built our own moon set worthy Apollo moon landings really a giant leap for mankind has claimed or just a small step for man in the 21st century one of our greatest achievements continues to fuel controversy that's one small step for man but worthy Apollo moon landings the culmination of a carefully orchestrated hoax bill kaysing is often called the father of moon conspiracy theorists when Armstrong said that's one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind I think that the footprint that he was leaving was in area 51 north of Las Vegas Nevada the second man of the moon close behind Armstrong was Edwin Buzz Aldrin I'm totally in favor of freedom of speech but I think people need to be responsible when they think about intentionally for their own benefit misleading the young people who are the future leaders of our world though the hard core of dedicated conspiracy theorists is small their ideas have over the past three decades found a wide and appreciative audience one in five americans are believed now to entertain doubts and it was the big black background with you know fake stars stuff it's the flag being planted on the moon facing one way and the shadow of the man being the other way there are no stars in some of the photographs and if there should be because there was no atmosphere and that the stars would shine so brightly if the Apollo missions were faked NASA would have created a conspiracy of monumental proportions forty years ago the Cold War locked the USA in an ideological struggle with the Soviet Union on October the 4th 1957 the Soviets launched Sputnik the world's first satellite it was a coup for communism the breakthrough hit America right where it hurt in the heart of high-technology Sputnik shocked a lot of people in this country and I think the president was looking for a way to respond to this and at the advice of a number of people he chose an objective that he felt for sure we could be first we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard at the peak of the Apollo program NASA employed 400,000 people if the moon landings were faked thousands of scientists and technicians were either duped along with the rest of us or they'd been extraordinarily good at keeping a secret all these years it was a giant step for mankind we moved from people dreaming about whether people could get into space and we went ahead in a very short time so it was a very momentous achievement July the 16th 1969 the astronauts prepare for takeoff while the world waited for history to be made there was already one man who had his doubts during the 1960's bill kaysing was head of technical publications for Rocketdyne a company involved in the manufacture of the Apollo rockets this gave him access to top-secret documents what he read led him to question the feasibility of the whole moon project he claims the CIA had made three attempts on his life to silence his controversial views today he keeps a low profile living on a cat Center in the Nevada desert I really believe that they work the command capsule at launch they did a little bit of a magician act with the astronauts they went up the elevator but they came down the elevator in other words they did not want to risk the lives of the astronauts in case the Saturn blew up like bill kaysing Ralph Rene a self-taught engineer and author believes that the technology of the day simply wasn't up to the task there is absolutely no way they went to the moon with what they had in fact there's no way they can go today there's no way they can go tomorrow you don't send man where you haven't sent the monkey nevertheless the president had promised a man on the moon by 1970 if NASA couldn't do it they'd have to fake it with foolproof documentary evidence Marcus Allen is the British publisher of Nexus a magazine dedicated to alternative politics history and science those photographs can be demonstrated not to have been taken on the lunar surface now if they were not taken on the lunar surface there's only one other place they could have been taken and that's on earth documentary evidence from all six of the successful Apollo landings show similar anomalies in some areas lit from behind which should be in deep shadow a bright and perfectly visible in other pictures the shadows are at near right angles suggesting to separate light sources perhaps most surprisingly there are no stars in the Apollo photographs even though they were taken from space when the archive film is sped up the astronauts appear to be running at normal speed in terrestrial gravity and why does the flag appear to be fluttering in a breeze even though there's no wind on the moon to test whether any of these allegations can be substantiated we plan to create our own lunar set its location the trona pinnacles a desert area for hours from Hollywood home of illusion our moon set will be used as a backdrop not to try and fake our own lunar landings but to test the most famous hoax theories we've brought in historically accurate props to recreate the iconic moments a single high-wattage studio lamp will replicate the intensity of the Sun as our sole light source by challenging some of the most famous conspiracy arguments colonel our experiments prove whether the small step for mankind was really the giant leap they said it was in 1969 the general public had little reason to doubt the evidence of its own eyes Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin have returned triumphant their achievement was a celebration of supremacy America had won the space race Ian Morrison witnessed the Apollo 11 mission from an exclusively privilege perspective at the time he was a student at the Jodrell Bank radio telescope near Manchester the telescopes radio tracking device allowed him to eavesdrop on the astronauts conversation but it also meant that it could follow the every move of the landing module the Eagle as it prepared to land on the lunar surface I should say that we were not officially tracking the Apollo craft we were doing this for fun our own fun than our own interest we could hear the whole conversation of the astronauts all the way down to surface they were obviously highly excited and it must be wonderful as they sort of literally reached the surface astronomer Sir Patrick Moore reported the mission live on British television it wasn't the dawn of human history we dreamed about going well the world's and this was the first time it had been done and of course it was an exciting time and also a very tense one and of course I knew both Neil and Buzz and of course there was no professional rescue had they made a 40 landing they couldn't have gone back and that would have been too costly to contemplate but the skeptics claim NASA faced an uphill struggle they could not guarantee success with the apparently primitive technology of the 1960s this was brought into sharp focus just 14 months before the mission when Neil Armstrong test piloted a prototype landing module unfortunately it went out of his control and luckily he was able to eject the Ford crashed in flames and of course the point is if they couldn't get a simulator to work on earth how in the world could they get the actual lunar module to work all alone the conspiracy theorists not only question the technical capabilities of the landing craft but also the computing power that guided it the processing power of the Apollo 11 spacecraft has been likened to that of a pocket calculator Jim Oberg is a former space shuttle engineer he was commissioned by NASA to write a book denying the conspiracy claims although it was pulled by NASA Oberg stayed on the case it's pretty amazing to realize there's probably more computer technology here in an automobile than the Apollo spacecraft but as Jim points out it's the way you use it that counts the Apollo computers spacecraft computers in those days spoke pretty much numeric language unlike modern-day pcs the Apollo computers didn't have to store files or process graphics they were dedicated number crunchers transmitting information from the mainframe computers on earth to the astronauts in space but it was a still a very simple computer and yet the exact tasks needed were well-defined and well understood the computer couldn't do a whole lot more but it was able to do enough for Apollo a Jodrell Bank Ian Morrison could chart the crucial last minutes of the computer guided eagle as it prepared to land we had some equipment here that could literally measure the acceleration or D acceleration of the spacecraft as it slowed down towards the surface and it's shown here graphically and this is literally just a copy of the original graph that we have and what you see here is a very nice smooth curve the fact is becoming more gentle means that the spacecraft was gently coming down to land under computer control but the interesting thing is that just before it looks as though it was going to land the graph changed and instead of going down that the craft accelerated upwards as we were at 500 feet and Neil Armstrong took over there the controls manually to to redirect it because he could see that we were headed for a place it didn't look too suitable and he wanted to fly over it on the other side Roger 1201 alarm right there we got worked on at alarm Neil Armstrong realized the automatic pilot was taking him straight down into a crater he lifted the lamb up and you can see this quite little bump here as he accelerated up from the surface and then you see this rather Wiggly bit as he basically flew over the surface beyond the crater and finally brought the LEM to land and then Neil's voice came through the evil landed and that to me was a minute of intense relief and since I'm on the air live I had to watch what I said but Man's first foray on the moon is the epicenter of the hoax theories in an attempt to disprove the missions the conspiracy theorists have analyzed every frame with a fine-tooth comb Buzz Aldrin stance across the moon scape has become one of the most celebrated moments in history near the end of the two and a half hours in front of the television camera I did have an opportunity to to prance around and and hop and demonstrate different methods of moving around the movement because of the restrictions of the spacesuit was basically like being in slow motion the skeptics claimed that far from being like slow motion this really was slow motion recorded in a studio and broadcast at half speed speed up buzz and he appears to be running albeit clumsily in terrestrial gravity back on our moon set our astronaut is wearing an accurate replica of an Apollo 11 suit if the conspiracy theorists are right by slowing him down we should be able to recreate Buzz's famous moonwalk the ungainly lobe looks half right but our astronauts still can't achieve the characteristic bounce and weightless grace of buzzes original NASA faced its own challenges trying to prepare the astronauts for life in space well there are a lot of different schemes of suspending a person and taking up one-sixth of his weight by by pulleys or working on a sort of a slanted platform NASA's other favorite method was parabolic flight lovingly known by the astronauts as the Vomit Comet by climbing and diving in a series of arcs the plane can simulate 30 second bursts of reduced gravity this gave astronauts a feel for the ups and downs of life in space but the suggestion that an entire lunar landscape could have been built inside the aircraft stretches credibility well beyond breaking point for the skeptics refuting the moonwalk theory means nothing they claim they have all the proof they need in the photographs I do not think it was feasible for the astronauts to take the wonderful pictures that NASA has presented as having been taken on the moon there are so many impediments that were natural the fact that they wore gloves that couldn't be manipulated the fact that they didn't have any sources of light any flash Ralph Renee also believes the design of the Apollo suits would have prevented the astronauts operating anything as delicate as a camera to prove the point he's designed a space glove machine which is supposed to replicate the effects of space on the body in the near vacuum of space the gasses within his body would immediately expand what I do is I pull a vacuum in this chamber I created and I have a glove inserted inside of it and it was to prove that the flexibility they shown in their suits and gloves are impossible right now I can put my hand in there and I can move it every which way I can grass I make a fist I can lift up down but as soon as I throw this switch here I evacuate the chamber as the air is sucked out of the Machine the vacuum makes the glove increasingly difficult to flex and this glove doesn't want to move I can can't bend it backwards I can hardly force it down and I could make a fist but you can't fold it and you could never take I mean how could you pick up small screws and bolts like they shown them to do or trigger a little tiny trigger on a camera with the glove doing this trained aerospace engineer Jay Windley runs a website dedicated to repudiating the moon conspiracies his passion and knowledge runs deep for this program he has agreed to challenge the most persistent conspiracy claims this is a Hasselblad al 500 camera manufactured specially for the lunar missions it attached to the spacesuit via this bayonet the camera would have a framework surrounding the bottom and rear of the camera and it would slide down on to the control unit here so that the astronaut could work with his hands without worrying about the camera the lunar cameras didn't need a viewfinder the restrictions of the helmet made it impossible for the astronauts to look down and frame a shot basically you could just sort of point that camera at what you wanted without having to really look through a viewfinder according to the conspiracy theorists this was a major impediment this is where the shutter is on the Hasselblad camera which cannot be seen from inside the helmet the astronauts are wearing so how do they know they've taken a photograph how do they know the fingers even got on with the shelter how do you know they pressed it the shutter release normally a very small button has been made especially large so that it can be pressed with an astronaut's glove reinforced in the suits also helped the astronauts manipulate the camera as did several other design features the zeiss biogon lens here has been fitted with these little paddles to allow the astronaut to manipulate them with clumsy fingers you just push it in either direction the focus ring has been fitted with stops that correspond to near medium far and infinity so he didn't have to pay attention to whether he was eight feet or nine feet away from a subject he wouldn't have to very carefully measure it Richard Underwood was responsible for training the Apollo astronauts in the art of lunar photography even in the early days before the United States you know when you get back from this journey you will be a national hero but your photographs I say if they're good they'll live forever I tell them your only key to immortality it's the quality of your photography nothing else forget all the other stuff the astronauts were told to take their lunar cameras everywhere and practice they took him home to photograph their friends and family and barbecues and sporting events and all other types of things they knew that camera very very effectively so all of the crew members understood pretty well how to operate this and the film turned out to be very very versatile in coming up with just outstanding results but even if you accept that photographs could physically have been taken on the moon you're still left with the most famous of the apparent photographic anomalies the shadows the shadows are one of the strong proofs that we never went to the moon if you examine pictures offered by a NASA as genuine you find that in many cases the shadows are not parallel well since the Sun was the only source of light all shadows on the moon should be exactly parallel but they are the lunar shadows sometimes fall in different directions the skeptics claim this as incontrovertible evidence of at least two light sources there's only one son there are not two but these shadows are anomalous and that sometimes they are diverging from objects and sometimes converging and and it can't be but you can go any place on this planet when the Sun's up and you look at two objects and those Sun shadows are parallel take up alpha next challenge and we can see shadows on always parallel shadows are a very poor way of determining the direction of the light source because they tend to diverge and converge based on the shape of the object that cast them and also because of the terrain that lies underneath them these affect the direction of shadows as we see them a conspiracy theorist to make that shadow go one direction or another both literally and figuratively he can drive a wedge in the layman's uncertainty about them the skeptics have also called into question areas that should be in shade claiming a second light has been used to highlight areas that should have been a dense black well let's have a look at one of the most famous photographs of the 20th century man on the moon he was taken by Neil Armstrong off Buzz Aldrin on Apollo 11 given that is very harsh light as you can see here where it strikes directly you would expect the shadow area to be virtually invisible but it's not yet on our moon set we can see the single light source does not create heavy shade as you can see there is only one light source in this entire picture and it's behind us according to the conspiracy theorists this side of the astronaut should be in total shadow but it isn't what's happening the light from the ground around us it's being reflected back up toward the astronaut and it's illuminating this portion of him the symbolic highlight of Apollo the planting of the American flag has also generated deep suspicion wherever there's an American flag it's always brilliantly lit up even if it's on the shadow side and on the shadow side that should be really dark black but they had little spotlights obviously because that's the only way conspiracy theorists say that it's suspicious for the flag to be brightly lit on both sides in all of the photographs they say it should appear it in shadow at some point here we can see our flag brightly lit from the front but if we move around to the back we can see that even with our single light source it's still brightly lit the light is shining through and making the flag glow but this does not explain how a flag can wave in a windless environment when they were filming some of the flag seems they had air conditioners going to keep the astronauts cooler since they were wearing their little spacesuits so it's very possible that what we saw was wind could the waving flag be a gaffe too far conclusive proof that the landings were faked in the studio on our moon set Jay windy hopes he can prove otherwise the Stars and Stripes planted by the Apollo astronauts provides the conspiracy theorists to what they believe is a trump card what I see is a flutter which is caused by variable wind pressures so the picture could not have been taken on a moon no matter what the apologists say either that or the moon has a breeze despite their preparations on earth neither Neil Armstrong nor Buzz Aldrin quite knew what to expect as they prepared to raise the flag putting the flag on the moon was really a symbolic highlight of the mission it was one that we had not really rehearsed Neil knew where the flag was stowed we brought it out then we had to put the two pieces together the astronauts had to drive the Flagstaff into the hard lunar surface with a twisting motion a horizontal aluminium rod kept the flag suspended and this caused the free end of the flag to flip up and back in response to that also this is an aluminum tube very similar to the ones used on the Apollo mission it's very springy if I cause it to spring and then let go of it we see that this motion continues long after I've let go of it on earth this pendulum motion would be dumped in engineering terms by air resistance but on the moon there is no air to slow the flag down and stop it waving most obvious evidence the flag was on the moon and not in the air is that whenever people walked by it it didn't move at all they only move when someone was working with the staff or let him go as it rocked back and forth it didn't billow like it was being hit by a burst of air it swung back and forth like maybe a sheet of chain maille would try it yourself try this at home but decrease gravity in the lack of atmosphere can't provide an explanation for the next apparent blunder when the 16 ton Eagle touched down it should claim the skeptics have disturbed the surface of the Moon blowing the top layer of dust away to expose the rock beneath but the images show footprints clearly imprinted around the base of the spacecraft surely the dust would have blown away or worse its enormous ly powerful jet of flame and he and gasps it would have easily scooped up an enormous crater in fact there was supposition that the crater would have been so big that the lunar lander would have disappeared into it that's true ruff renee has designed a simple experiment to illustrate the point he's calculated that the landing module would have been approximately 26 times more powerful than a domestic leaf blower and if a humble leaf blower can leave a crater in a gravel pit the module with 10,000 pounds of thrust should have made a canyon they didn't move dry dust they didn't move little rocks they didn't move anything so the demonstration is to show that this stuff will disappear immediately and I'll even be able to get some kind of a hole come here you might use you in a long time here we go according to Ralph Rene's experiment the moon like the gravel-pit wouldn't have stood a chance when it actually landed the dust was all still there now how can that be you know if you blowed that's the way it goes away bike I just did here I swept the ground but the Eagle had reduced its power to 25% as it glided into land it's gentle forward motion would have limited its impact on the ground even more under closer inspection some of the photos do reveal that the landing disturbed the fine lunar soil but not enough to blow away all surrounding dust but the most intriguing anomaly has to be the absence of the largest most stunning object seen in space in a sky untouched by streetlights atmosphere or pollution the view of the night sky should be spectacular but incredibly stars appear to be missing from the Apollo photographs back then fortunately for me and us who are trying to break this thing out the truth they took no pictures other stars bill kaysing believes that emitting the Stars was all part of NASA's deception astronomers could have easily discerned that the star positions were not those that would have appeared in a photograph taken from the moon so it's another case where they could not fake it so they simply ignored it if you were to talk to Aldrin or Armstrong or any of the other Apollo astronauts they would actually not respond in any way to questions regarding stars when you looked up at the sky could you actually see the stars in the solar corona in spite of the glare we were never able to see stars from the lunar surface or on the daylight side of the Moon by eye without looking through the optics I all stayed on from when he saw stars and you asked if I knew the answer of course the point is that their eyes weren't adapted to that the human eye reacts to light by closing and opening the iris in bright light the iris becomes smaller in the dark it widens on the moon the eye like a camera aperture cannot adjust to the brightness of the lunar surface and the dim light of a twinkling star at the same time if you were to stand in a floodlit stadium or under a streetlight in a city you would have the same effect we looked up you wouldn't see many stars at all even a modern state-of-the-art TV camera can't cope with such extreme contrast on our moon set Jay Windley plans to put the whole matter to an exhaustive test and dispute the theory once and for all we're going to find out that if we use an identical camera loaded with identical film and we shoot pictures of the night sky we won't get stars okay I'm going to take a shot here you notice here I'm not using any sort of a viewfinder I'm just aiming with a replica Apollo Hasselblad Jay took more than 24 photographs and repeated the experiment using a range of other cameras to test the hoax theories the morning after the negatives were developed as an independent processing laboratory in Los Angeles in our experiment in the desert we shot a variety of photographs using different film formats in this 35 millimeter photograph we see that the shadows of the crewmembers in our single light source very distinctly converged together fact there's almost a 90 degree difference in the apparent shadow direction in this photograph here we see the effects of terrain on the shadows the hills change the apparent direction of shadows the astronaut's shadow here falls in one direction the shadow of the crew falls in yet another direction because of the hill these results directly contradict the conspiracy claims like the Apollo astronauts we had to guess at our focusing distances and our exposure settings and because we had no viewfinder we had to guess at the direction the camera was pointing and you can clearly see that even with those handicaps we were able to take quite useable photographs you can immediately see that there are no stars in this photograph even though the stars were very bright during our experiment they're simply too dim to be registered on film after the exposure levels that we use to take these photographs the evidence appears to be overwhelming but still the skeptics refused to lie down and roll over a mysterious rock in a notorious Apollo 16 photograph has only added fuel to the fire it's a rock that obviously were made out of paper mache and very clearly on the rock is the letter C Ralph Rene believes the C rock was probably the C prop if somebody told me that in Hollywood when they do is set this day at the set manager comes around and drops cards on the ground and it says abcdefgh or 1 to 10 or whatever and the prop men of whatever you call these people they come out and they put that particular prop over the card but in Hollywood they're smart enough to turn the thing upside down so you can't see the mark on the on the prop NASA simply claims that this photo was a freak accident but the C is in fact a hair on the negative but this nitpicking over photographs is irrelevant for magazine publisher Marcus Allen he's convinced that no photographic film could possibly have survived the journey to the moon and back in the first place in an unprotected camera in unprotected environment and the films though in photographs we have seen as a result of that it demonstrates absolutely no radiation damage whatsoever in 1998 imax began production on a film about the construction of the International Space Station they flew the cameras up into space shuttle with their magazines attached and the IMAX cameras takes 70 millimeter roll film incidentally the same film as was used in the Hasselblad still cameras on Apollo this film had to be protected and it was carried up in LED lying boxes radiation may be the final insurmountable obstacle not only would it apparently destroy film it would also kill the astronauts the Earth's magnetic field shields our planet from high doses of radiation but beyond this in space the conspiracy theorists claim the astronauts fragile flesh will be bombarded by an arsenal of deadly forces the moon is irradiated by the Sun constantly with terrible heat and of course there is cosmic radiation and then there are micro meteorites that travel 60 thousand miles an hour that would go right through the camera the film and of course the astronauts themselves while the odds against a micrometeoroid hitting an astronaut are Janine's to be extremely low any puncture would be decidedly uncomfortable not only that on leaving the Earth's atmosphere the astronauts had to negotiate the Van Allen belts via now and he said it was a sea of deadly radiation you would pick up a death dose just about the time you got through the Van Allen shield you'd be cooked and you'd be dying these radioactive belts form a thick invisible ring around the earth's equator thinning out around the north and south poles until they get an engine that'll lift the life capsules surrounded by six feet of water or equivalent mass of lead they don't even there go through the vein and shield in fact dr. Van Alen is still alive it makes no secret of the fact that he thinks these stories about killer radiation are silly entertaining but preposterous is his words the reason is that the radiation levels there are not enough to hurt you unless you stay there for a long time Van Alen says about a month NASA claims the astronauts enjoyed only a very brief exposure passing through the thinnest parts of the belts in a matter of hours but once they were through they faced a still more deadly phenomenon so here we have these clowns running around and tinfoil craft stopping solar radiation and I'm not talking about the light I'm talking about the radiation from the solar storms you put a man in a powerful solar flare he's dead and historic he is dead unless he carries protection these unpredictable eruptions from the Sun can knock out satellites and electricity grids on earth but they can be detected by an early warning computer system when you land on the moon you're practically standing still being bombarded with all this solar radiation and smacking into you which is why they had to hide the whole thing because it just can't be done it couldn't be done then can't be done today and it sure isn't gonna be done in the future when they're planning on this manned mission to Mars just three months after the Apollo 16 mission NASA admitted that a violent solar flare did hit the moon's surface it was powerful enough to have killed the astronauts solar flares are one of those things that you have to take a calculated risk on because they will zap you with radiation whenst once they get to you but you've got a long time hours if not a day or more to either come back to earth find a shielded place or prepare yourself the astronauts only potential shield was their spacecraft and they had plans for this plan was to turn that bulky end of the ship toward the incoming front of radiation that bulk of the ship and all the fuel it would provide plenty of protection for that burst of radiation the conspiracy theorists believe that radiation is the final nail in the coffin scientific proof that the astronauts could not have survived a trip to the moon and back but paradoxically radiation may also offer proof of the counter claim that we've definitely been to the moon and souvenirs brought back may prove it in total the Apollo missions brought back over three hundred and eighty-two kilograms of lunar soil and rock samples which were distributed to laboratories all over the world at the independent berkeley geochronology center in california geologist paul renee has been studying lunar rock samples for the last ten years his main interest is the tiny glass spheres found on the moon's surface created by the intense heat of a meteorite impact the serials that we've been analyzing our tiny balls of glass so they're like magma that we find on the earth in that sense but they've they've cooled very very quickly and so they form a essentially uniform glass sphere with less gravity to distort their shape Lunas Farrell's are generally larger and rounder than their earth counterparts but it's the age that really sets them apart in this copper disk we have loaded 145 of these lunar cereals this copper disc will then be loaded into a sample chamber which you can see here by using a laser heating system to release the gas is contained in the sphere oohs Paul Renee contestant for cosmic radiation determining their age and thus the Holy Grail their true origin the lunar materials that we've analyzed and and that others have analyzed show evidence of having been bombarded by cosmic radiation in which we don't see on earth because we have an atmosphere that really shields them very effectively according to the tests the spirals are 3.9 billion years old this immediately rules out any terrestrial origin the oldest class I'm aware of on the earth anywhere is about a hundred and sixty-five million years old so the earth with its very dynamic environment does not tend to preserve these glassy objects whereas the moon being essentially dead from from a thermal point of view does tend to preserve these things the results that we obtained are absolutely definitively proof of a lunar origin I can say with utmost assurance that they're that they were derived from the moon the conspiracy theorists have heard this sort of thing a thousand times they're not fooled for a second the lunar rocks were faked just like the pictures were in the stories of the astronauts nASA has a ceramics laboratory where it would have been very easy to Bruce the eight hundred pounds of rocks allegedly brought back from the moon but it's evidence the astronauts left behind not what they brought back that may finally prove the skeptics wrong each mission set up a series of experiments more than 30 years after the Apollo 11 mission one of them continues to function the lunar laser ranging there were two major experiments one was a series of corner reflectors to reflect laser beams from the earth sent to the moon that then because of the geometry of these corner reflectors would send the beam back in exactly the direction that it came from high up in the Davis mountain range the McDonald Observatory in Texas still gathers information from those reflectors in 30 years no one has showed up no one has come and and talked to us Jerry Wyant would welcome a visit from the conspiracy theorists since 1969 his team has been firing a laser beam at the experiment on average 240 times a year and of course an Apollo 11 site is where the United States placed its first lunar retro package so we leave fire laser at this spot and two others three others on the moon now he's turned the laser on in a few seconds to see the the splice the laser hits the apparatus on the moon's surface and is reflected back as a series of pulses invisible to the human eye by measuring the amount of time it takes for each laser pulse to return to Earth Jerry and the team can gather exact information about the Earth's position in the solar system that's not like coming from the moon the splash you see is is like coming from the end of our own telescope that's the first spot where a man walked on the moon it's a tough one to refute and perhaps unsurprisingly the conspiracy theorists tend to grow reticent when the subject of laser reflectors crops up and so it's sad that the detractors have never taken the time to ask the people who are actually involved they just make up their mind that it's a hoax and never bothered to ask us during the Cold War both the Soviet Union and East Germany had agents in place to spy on the Apollo program if there had been a hoax they would have noticed but the conspiracy theorists have conveniently ignored their listening powers why not they ask the Russians the Russians were in direct competition with us and if they the Russians suspected in any way that we were faking anything that a data broadcast that all over the world every time and go to a new frontier further out people will tell stories other people will wrap them in myth and the hoax theory is a compelling myth like explorers proving the earth to be round not flat it seems as if all great achievements will always attract disbelief uncontroverted the million years of human history going to the moon baying for the moon wishing for the moon was a metaphor for impossible and suddenly people did it but I think a large part of it is just cultural vandalism cultural vandal I like it I think I've got to get aside for my car I am a cultural head though that's a good one like the urge to deface the Mona Lisa or to carve your initials into it into a statue to carve your initials onto the face of the Apollo program is just the urge that people seem to have some people perhaps the final proof is this compared to difficulties involved in sustaining such an elaborate scam wouldn't it be so much easier to build a rocket and fly to the moon"

Skip and Shannon: UNDISPUTED
https://www.youtube.com/c/UndisputedOnFS1",Kevin Durant just made a huge mistake’ joining Nets with Kyrie — Skip Bayless | NBA | UNDISPUTED,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FOK2m0cmY7E,0,1086406,10041,935,3365,FOK2m0cmY7E,which is why I remain shocked over this I still can't wrap my head around it and after I slept on it for the night the harder I think about it the worse it gets I don't understand it I in the end it was about Kyrie and friendship as you say yeah but Kevin still too young to opt for just friendship Kevin Durant just made a huge mistake to me and I don't understand it because in the end if you told me a month ago that Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving would wind up signing with the Nets I would have said yeah and pigs are gonna fly because if I told you that a month ago before we heard any of this you would have laughed it's impossible what just happened and I'm gonna remind everybody this is for our younger viewers out there the legacy move for Kevin Durant was obviously to go to the Knicks if you're not gonna stay with Golden State which was on the table and you were pushing for that you thought that would be the operative right but but if barring that if you're going to choose somewhere else to go it has to be the Knicks because I know the kids out there right now think of the next is this this sorry punchline of a franchise this embarrassing laughingstock this disaster of an unlovable loser that's what the Knicks are in in recent memory yes or really for about 20 years it's been that way basically Kevin did a his lifetime skip yeah doesn't remember the MiGs like you remembered I got it but just for the record they are the biggest sleeping giant in all of sports there's nothing close to those Knicks you could argue the Cubs used to be the Knicks but this is the Knicks they play in the most hallowed arena in all of sports and it ain't even close right it is the mecca it is Madison Square Garden it is entertainment personified because of all the superstars in all forms of entertainment who have play the palace that is Madison Square Garden everybody wants to go there every opponent wants to have this best game at Madison Square Garden I will give you they have the worst owner in sports but that has been slightly cancelled by a very good coach and David fission I like this and if you look at Scott Terry's track record they're fairly new GM he's been there two years he has he has a resume behind him he helped build the Pistons championship team and that run that they had yes okay so I respect him and I respect what they could be and I don't respect the fact that Kevin said no to this and I get it and ESPN reported that they wouldn't offer the max to Kevin Durant because of injury history I'm gonna get to that in just a minute because you did make a strong point he does have injury history and and he is he's a pretty big risk right now okay I get that part but it was also it also came clear later in the evening that Kevin Durant and Kyrie took less to go to the Nets so that they could get their other friend their other if we can go Banana Boat for those three guys they haven't actually ridden a banana boat to my knowledge but they all belong on a banana boat those three do DeAndre Jordan who played briefly with the Knicks last year but they had to get him under the cap at ten million which is probably more than he's worth right now he's their friend right so to get him under they all took those two took a little less right okay so with that mitigate the circumstance a little bit the Knicks are saying well we can't Kevin go to the max well if I'm Kevin Durant I don't care how much they pay me because as you have pointed out many times he has so many lucrative investments in Silicon Valley that remain in operation just just because he's an absentee owner now doesn't mean anything he's fine you can run them from a distance right and he has made so much money in his career this was legacy this is your chance to go there and revive a sleeping giant that hasn't won a championship since 1973 this was your chance to win another championship with the Knicks that would obliterate all the criticism you got for leaving Russell Westbrook in Oklahoma City to join forces with the guys that had just come from 3-1 down to beat you Steph clay a dream on right yes this is a chance if you want a couple of championships with the Knicks you'd need Kyrie along also but if you've both chosen the Knicks you could have started making the case in the end that you were the second best player in the history of basketball to Michael Jordan that's how big an opportunity you just left on the table for what you know what it's for I think it's just friendship no seriously that's what is I think it's what he never could connect with in Golden State he went there thinking maybe I'll become friends with Steph and they couldn't become friends right but we're gonna talk about that later we're gonna talk about it later but they never quite clicked and he went there thinking maybe draymond will become my best friend and they had a terrible falling out which led to some terrible comments made by draymond so he felt like he never really he kind of had to go his own way last year in Golden State right yeah he was a man on an island and sometimes you could see it in the way they played or didn't play right okay so he's saying at this stage of my career I opt for Kyrie and DeAndre well here's the shock to me I think Kyrie is the alpha here because we kept hearing for I don't know a couple of weeks that it was Nets Nets nets for Kyrie and I kept thinking Kyrie are you gonna go this alone because I couldn't imagine Kevin also joining the Nets I thought it was going to be Kyrie or bust for the nets okay so help me out here I think it was Kyrie who said Kevin we got to go Nets because of what your your kind of going to the Clippers right you're going to a team that was 42 and 40 you said they have better pieces and they do have a little better pieces but they're not exactly a championship waiting to happen right now right no I just think the thing is is that it was it would take longer for the Knicks to get those pieces the next this is you know they put all the eggs they were gonna get Zion they really thought they were gonna get Zion and that didn't happen and so now they created all this caps face they traded for zingers they got rid of the Tim Hardaway jr. contract too open up all this cap space basically for two they wanted to or the three guys they want to carry KD and Kauai and come to find out skip they don't get the number one overall draft pick they don't get Kyrie they don't get Kauai they don't get KD they struck out with all the keys it's I guess I guess Kaizen order and so it was it was a flat-out disaster and so now you giving guys bobby portis and you julius Rendon I get all that skill but for me what this tells me about Kevin Durant is that now I would rather win a title with my friends and because after he won the first tie to remember skip he said is that it this is this what is worth where's where's the hundred one hundred marching behind remember marching band wear it wear it were the orchestra wears another thing that comes along with this you see what happened to go to the state's gift he won a title with teammates now he wants to win a title with friends okay what happened there skip in Golden State you look at this KD not KD excuse me draymond Klay and Steph they grew up together it would have been the equivalent if KD had won in OKC that's with him Serge and Russ I agree with that and it never quite the bonding never quite took place because Stefan him was a different skill when he got this step was happily married with two kids Katie's coming in single yeah so this never get was never gonna work so I assume he and Kyrie are so close that that he listened to Kyrie who said let's go Nets and I'm assuming he listened to DeAndre who remember was with the Knicks last year for he played 19 out of 31 games so he got a taste of the culture under David visiting right I'm gonna guess DeAndre Jordan told KD no no on David fizz Dale and maybe the entire well I think he likes fizz Dale I just don't think he liked the organization covers remember skip the last I think he was a DMP the last seven games was not not surprisingly bright go ahead it seems like they were going in a different direction they wanted to go young and DeAndre understood that okay so this feels for me a little like the choice LeBron to come to Los Angeles no matter if I have a coast or not I want to go to LA and you can argue with me all day until cows come home or don't come home that LeBron chose the Lakers in part because of Hollywood in part and now to me kevin has made a similar choice at an advanced stage he's been 12 this is 12 year he's been 12 years in the league he made a choice I just want to play with my friend right title or no title I'm not sure title is his priority right now again Brooklyn is a little better situated to make a run with those two guys but but Kevin obviously can't play next year well what did you think what did you what did you tell me all last week Kevin Durant will do things that will bring fireworks where you least expect it Kyrie marches to his own drum his own beat they will do things that's you like because everybody's thinking they're going to the mix why not go to the Knicks the Knicks is so hallowed the Madison Square Garden the biggest acts performed there why wouldn't you two guys want to perform on that stage mmm is it not we go to Brooklyn we're gonna make Brooklyn a stage like the Knicks that's how they think skip because you know when you get to that level you have supreme confidence in your ability and what you can and can't do all right back to the Knicks if I ran the Knicks would I have plunged and offered Kevin Durant the max you better believe I don't have because you just have to yes you just got rid of porzingis to do this just do it yes do you have legit concerns about it you better believe I do because what happened to DeMarcus Cousins he came back after a year and yet all the Warriors said he never looked right all of last year I couldn't run up and down the floor couldn't get back in shape and he often complained that his foot on the Achilles side hurt him right we saw flashes of brilliance in the finals right but it could only be for four minutes here in five minutes here right yes is that gonna be the Kevin Durant we see in two years might he need a whole year back yes to get right so I believe sure okay yeah thank you for watching you can

moonlanding,"The Big Bang is the name of the most respected theory of the creation of the universe.  Basically, the theory says that the universe was once smaller and denser and has been expending for eons.  One common misconception is that the Big Bang theory says something about the instant that set the expansion into motion, however this isn’t true.  In this video, Fermilab’s Dr. Don Lincoln tells about the Big Bang theory and sketches some speculative ideas about what caused the universe to come into existence.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYDokJ2A_vU",The Big Bang Theory,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZDa6d93ywE,0,97210,2077,59,268,gZDa6d93ywE,you most people are interested in origin stories we're simply curious as to what was the cause of this thing or that in some cases the answer is simple for instance my origin is my mom pushing back further you would encounter my grandmother great-grandmother and so on looking even deeper in time we could identify the species from which Homo sapiens evolved and continue the chain all the way back to the primordial ooze we don't understand every detail of that chain but we do understand the big strokes and there is no controversy about the general process however the biggest origin story of all involves the origin of everything the very birth of the universe itself this is another topic about which scientists know a great deal although as we will see not everything our universe began about 14 billion years ago in a cataclysmic explosion that we call the Big Bang people have some misconceptions about exactly what the term the Big Bang really means so we'll return to that in a moment the short description is that the Big Bang Theory says first that the universe expanded from a hotter denser form to the cosmos we see today and the second that the expansion continues today there are lots of reasons why this theory is now accepted essentially universally among scientists let me sketch out just a few in 1929 Edwin Hubble discovered that distant galaxies are moving away from us and that the farther away the galaxies are the faster they're moving while his study is only involved galaxies about 6 million light-years from us in the intervening century scientists have peered deeper into space looking billions of light-years away and everywhere the same story is told the universe is expanding a second bit of evidence is the observed ratios of hydrogen and helium we see when we look into space in 1948 Ralph Alpher Hans bethe and George Gamow published a paper in which they predicted the ratio of the number of hydrogen atoms and the number of helium atoms that would have been produced when the universe was formed this prediction which is very straightforward says that for every 92 hydrogen atoms there should be eight helium atoms all other elements are negligible when scientists look in the universe they find that observations confirm this prediction very well a third bit of evidence was discovered in the 1960s if the universe was created in a primordial fireball this fireball had a temperature as the universe expanded this temperature fell in 1964 the temperature of the universe was determined to be two point seven degrees Kelvin or 455 degrees Fahrenheit below zero no matter where you look in the universe this is the temperature you see this observation along with improvements over the last 50 years has proven to be a goldmine of data from which to understand the early universe these three bits of data strongly support the conjecture that the universe was once smaller and hotter and has been expanding over the last 13.7 billion years there is much more data than what I sketched here that adds to the scientific community's confidence in the idea with one of the more in awe inspiring ones being the realization that collisions in the Large Hadron Collider can generate temperatures not common since the universe was a tenth of a trillionth of a second old in short all of the data supports the idea of an ancient universe that originated in the blink of an eye the data is quite compelling and the scientific community is essentially unanimous in support of this conclusion this period of expansion which does not include the exact instant in which the expansion started is what scientists mean when they talk about the Big Bang this is an important point precisely what started the expansion is outside the current Big Bang model so what started the universe in motion what turned that tiny and compact cosmos into the expanding and glorious mess we see when we turn our eyes to the heavens the honest answer is simple we well we just don't know so what scientifically credible hypotheses have been advanced as possibilities well perhaps the most common one is that since the universe was much smaller and compact the laws of quantum mechanics or what reigned supreme just like the virtual particles we see today what some scientists call quantum foam the early universe was filled with evanescent particles and just like the quantum mechanics we see today a rare fluctuation in the quantum foam overcame the binding forces of the small universe and set the expansion into motion this sounds a bit like waving one's hands but the phenomena I have mentioned here or things we see today and we understand very well so the idea isn't so far-fetched indeed it's actually quite reasonable in mainstream however this idea isn't the only one put forth by theoretical physicists one idea is that before our universe began there were giant multi-dimensional strings while membranes really floating around in some higher dimensional space two of them collided depositing a lot of energy in the process and thereby creating our universe another idea invokes loop quantum gravity in some of these models the universe has experienced a series of big bounces in which the universe expands contracts and begins again this idea flies in the face of our understanding of the current universe and the expansion phase seems to be endless however maybe some new physics will counteract the observed expansion phase and start a contraction one a fourth speculative idea uses M theory which is an extension of superstring theory and says the universes have existed for a long time perhaps forever these universes but off earlier universes one of which is ours kind of like a blob and a lava lamp the word we use for this ensemble of many universes is the multiverse that word can be confusing since the word universe traditionally has meant everything there is but I suppose the word makes sense if there are several independent universes that don't communicate with one another the important point when thinking about the beginning of the universe is to separate those things we know from those things about which we can simply speculate for instance in the know category there is no credible scientific dissension over the idea that the universe wants smaller and hotter and has been expanding for about fourteen billion years the situation is a lot murkier when our attention turns to the mechanism that actually began our universe no honest scientist can tell you that they know the answer to that question however just because scientists don't know the final answer doesn't mean that all ideas are possible some ideas have been disproven but for all we know there is much that we don't the question of the creation of the universe has tugged at our minds for millennia and this is no less true for modern man scientists continue to think of ways that we can study this question and draw a definitive conclusion although I am confident that we'll have to wait a long time for the final answer but you know the answer will totally be worth the wait

10,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmc9P891qRA,0,61159,467,67,0,Tmc9P891qRA,"with the first man to walk on the moon and following his space mission Neil Armstrong became so popular he reportedly received 10,000 fan letters every day so what was it like having Neil Armstrong as a father and seeing him go into space well our very own and sat down with Neil Armstrong's sons to find out more take a look first man to walk on the moon there'd be something over Neil Armstrong died in 2012 he gave his okay for this movie to be made and his family are thrilled that audiences will finally get to know the man who made the giant leap for mankind I sure yeah be an adventure Raik mark lovely to meet you both and thank you so much for talking to me today how does it feel to have this film on the big screen and about to be enjoyed by fans around the world I think we're very happy that this film is going to be shown and seems because it's very accurate and it feels very authentic to us I think that dad has been mischaracterized over the years as reclusive and none of those things are true so it's nice for the record to be set straight and for people to get a little chance to get to know him better new if his flight is successful you'll go down in history what kind of thoughts do you have about that we're planning on the flight being successful there's a case scene in the film where your mom asks your dad to tell you boys about the risks of what he's about to do as he sets off on the Apollo 11 mission is is that pretty accurate and what do you remember of that conversation what did your dad actually say to you that meeting really did take place it really took place in the dining room that scene is because we gave them that scene right what you're not coming back those kids they don't have a father anymore great so they're gonna sit the boys down and you're gonna prepare them for the fat you might not ever come home do you think you're coming back there are risks but we have every intention of coming back the things that Ryan says in that about you know we're confident in the mission but I think we're coming back but there are some risks does anybody have any questions that absolutely is what he said we both came away from that meeting feeling confident and and not scared at all which is amazing really yeah because our mother must have been terrified I've got a dozen cameras on my front lawn deke don't be telling them what's going on Jen you have to trust us we've got this under control no you don't all these protocols and procedures to make it seem like you have it under control but you're a bunch of boys making models out of balsa wood you don't have anything under control the table was the other way yeah he's a stickler just like his father yeah no I have no idea what he's going to say but whatever he says I'm sure it won't be worthwhile Jenna damn strong only passed away a few months ago did she get to see the film I regret to say that she passed away before the film was finished she wasn't able to see it but she we got to meet with her as we were researching the movie and she read drafts of the script and she got to see some of the footage thanks to her son's Rick and Mark who have been huge helps all the way through the process Janet is just an extraordinary person I was so lucky to get to spend even just a little time with her Ryan and I got to sit with her and just ask her what her life was like what those years and her Neil's life was like 61 to 69 I mean I think you could safely say that no married couple in human history has been through quite what they went through in that period of time and so it felt like if we could route the movie in that relationship make it really a movie about the two of them and about a marriage that goes through this sort of extraordinary ordeal it would give the movie a heart that it needed Apollo astronauts Roger Chaffee Edward white and Gus Grissom lose their lives and a tragic flash fire aboard their grounded space capsule how old were you when Apollo 1 mission yeah what was that it was it was not good and Jan Armstrong was who ended up telling telling my mom and my brother and I were in the car she's in our driveway and I still remember seeing her standing there and kind of like what what is she doing you know it was really hard mom was very good friends with Pat white and she was able to see how pat was affected when her husband died yeah when her husband died yeah so she knew what could happen and I think that that's what motivated her to insist that that meeting take place did you believe in your hearts he was coming back oh yeah never not not concerned at all Wow yeah anything went wrong they'd figure it out Neil we're in a bank cuz he was the master of figuring stuff out went up went wrong wasn't he it had that incident pop around the atmosphere some way be other yeah committee that our chef he just knew how to fix stuff didn't he yeah he was very calm in a crisis and I think that's true of a lot of the astronauts when you trained as a test pilot for years and years you realize that when something goes wrong you can't panic you have to work the problem so that's the way he was I have to ask the grief of losing your sister is pivotal to what drove your father that's very much a theme in the film do you think it's important for people to have that understanding you know what I want people to know is that Karen's death affected our parents both very very deeply she died on their wedding anniversary and so it's something that they just never found a way to talk about together and of course they never celebrated their wedding anniversary from that point forward there's a scene in the film and I don't want to do a spoiler something that was left behind on the moon is that accurate we don't know if he left something for Karen it was a private thing that he told no one about it's possible tell me what do you boys think of the conspiracy theorists who say that it's never happening it's just it's frustrating daddy used to have a letter people would write him about you know you never really went to the moon and admitted anything and and he had a letter that he'd sent out and it basically said you know you you're free to believe whatever you want but but every major scientific organization in the world and they listed about 20 of them you know including the Soviet Union and others that had every reason to to disprove it they all certify that it happens so make that of it what you will everybody loves a good conspiracy theory now you've got an auction coming up in November of some pretty amazing stuff what sort of things are gonna be available don't be a lot of things that dad took with him on his flights some historical documents a lot of photographs you know after the flight they did a world tour yeah and went to many different countries all in a very short period of time there were a lot of photos from that world tour you know we struggled a lot with whether we wanted to to do this in this manner but we eventually decided there was a lot of good that we could do with proceeds and we look forward to figuring out ways that we can can help the world in it and in ways that our mother and father would have supported and we can't crowd so Neil Armstrong Neil and Jenna now had a two-year-old daughter who passed away from brain cancer and that grief was part of what drove him to to want to you know conquer this great big barrier for mankind and and that the death of those three astronauts and that earlier mission they died on the launch when it caught fire and these are their best friends and neighbors and then you know their their daughter Bonnie who I interviewed there lost her dad at 10 and then those little boys had to watch me we'll go up and hope he come back you just so you think you know the story and it's just so much of the story of the moon launch generation I remember I was we all got moved into mrs. Reynolds third class to sit on the floor and in was wheeled the black-and-white TV at war away public go Wildcats science room the science lecture room of there was some Peter's College in Brisbane in 1969 do you actually remember like details for so long because it at all you thought I'll just land like you know land a bison no he'll be right but but it took there was about six hours know when the all the time everything was departed and then landed and then he had to wait till everything opened up and then he walked down and it was all black and white was fantastic I remember don't forget you wouldn't have seen any of those pictures if it weren't for the dish at a fantastic working dog film which I've actually gone back to watch after this because it was just so pivotal part of the story and I spoke to all of the guys over there it's one of Neil and one of Rick and Mark Armstrong's favorite movies the dish and Damien Chazelle it watched it Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy and I'm going to watch it but yeah so the first man is open today if you want to go and get your moon boots on and have some fun"
moonlanding,"Launched three years before the new century... a spacecraft wound its way through the empty reaches of the solar system. On Earth, its progress was little noted, as it swung twice by the planet Venus, then our moon. And Earth. The asteroid belt. And Jupiter.

Almost seven years later, on the first of July 2004, the Cassini probe entered the orbit of Saturn. It then began to compile what has become one of the greatest photographic collections of all time, of a giant gas planet, surrounded by colorful rings, guarded by a diverse collection of moons, and millions of tiny moonlets. 

Within this record, is a trail of clues... pointing to the energy sources and complex chemistry needed to spawn life. What are these mysterious worlds telling us about the universe, and Earth? 

In the outer reaches of the solar system, a billion and a half kilometers from the Sun... there is a little world known as Enceladus. Nearly all of the sunlight that strikes its icy surface is reflected back into space, making it one of the brightest objects in the solar system.

At its equator, the average temperature is minus 198 degrees Celsius. It can rise about 70 degrees higher in grooves that stretch across the south pole like tiger stripes.  Looming over it is the giant planet Saturn.

In myth, Saturn - the Roman name for the primal Greek God Chronos - was the youngest son of Gaia, or Earth, and Uranus, sky. Wielding a scythe provided by his mother, the story goes, Saturn confronted his abusive father, castrating him. The blood of Uranus flowed into the seas, fertilizing the Earth and giving rise to Enceladus and other giant offspring. 

Saturn's moon Enceladus has its own tangled story. In 2005, the Cassini spacecraft spotted plumes of water vapor shooting out into space from its south pole. 

More recent close encounters have revealed jets of water, flavored by slightly salty chemical compounds, spewing out from vents in the rough, cracked polar terrain. That may mean that Enceladus harbors a remarkable secret below its frigid surface: A liquid ocean, and perhaps, a chemical environment that could spawn simple life forms. 

It's not the only promising stop in the realm of Saturn. The moon Titan is often said to resemble Earth in its early days. It is lined with volcanoes and a hazy atmosphere rich in organic compounds. 

While Enceladus is the size of Great Britain, Titan is ten times larger, 50% larger than our moon, and the second largest moon in our solar system.

We've known about Titan since the astronomer Christian Huygens discovered it in 1655, and Enceladus since William Herschel spotted it in August 1789, just after the start of the French Revolution. 

Scientists began to investigate these moons in earnest with the launch of the two Voyager spacecraft in 1977.  The lineup of outer planets in the solar system allowed the spacecraft to fly past each of them.

They disclosed new details about their magnetic fields, atmospheres, ring systems, and inner cores. But what really turned heads were the varied shapes and surfaces of their moons. 

They've all been pummeled over the millennia by wayward asteroids and comets. A few appear to be sculpted by forces below their surfaces. Neptune's largest moon Triton has few craters. It's marked with circular depressions bounded by rugged ridges. There are also grooves and folds that stretch for dozens of miles, a sign of fracturing and deforming. 

Triton has geysers too, shooting some five miles above the surface. But on this frigid moon -- so far from the Sun -- the liquid that spouts is not water but nitrogen. 

Tiny Miranda, one of 27 known moons that orbit Uranus, wears a jumbled skin that's been shaped and reshaped by forces within. Jupiter's moon Io -- orbiting perilously close to the giant planet is literally turning itself inside out. Rivers of lava roll down from open craters that erupt like fountains.
 
Flying by Europa, Voyager documented a complex network of criss-crossing grooves and ridges. In the 1990s, the Galileo spacecraft went back to get a closer look. It found that Europa's surface is a crazy quilt of fractured plates, cliff faces and gullies... amid long grooves like a network of superhighways. How did it get like this? 

Then, heat rising up through a subsurface ocean of liquid water cracks,  and shifts, and spreads the icy surface in a thousand different ways. Europa's neighbors, Callisto and Ganymede, show similar features, suggesting they too may have liquid oceans below their surfaces.
 
Crossing outward to Saturn, Voyager found a similar surface on the moon Enceladus. So when the Cassini spacecraft arrived in 2004, it came looking for answers to a range of burning questions: if this moon and others have subsurface oceans?

 life? The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa offers a window into the churning activity
 at its core. Flying by Europa, Voyager documented a complex

 cliff faces and gullies... amid long grooves like a network of superhighways. How did it
 get like this? Europa orbits Jupiter in a slight ellipse,
 diving in close before swinging wide. That allows the massive planet's gravity to constantly
 tug at its rocky center. The friction of rock rubbing on rock causes that core to heat up. Then, heat rising up through a subsurface
 ocean of liquid water cracks, and shifts, and spreads the icy surface in a thousand
 different ways. Europa's neighbors, Callisto and Ganymede, show similar features, suggesting

 to analyze light waves, to figure out the composition of dust, measure magnetic fields,
 and more. After a year in orbit, Cassini let go of its
 traveling companion, the Huygens probe... and sent it parachuting down to the surface
 of Titan. Unexpected crosswinds buffeted Huygens' parachute,
 but the probe was able to snatch a wealth of revealing information. Its on-board radar showed a complex topography
 with ridges, rivers, and lakes, and even rocks on the ground. Titan's atmosphere is thick and cold. Like
 Earth, the air here is mostly nitrogen gas. What's more, Titan's muddy, wet terrain is
 laced with organic compounds. On our planet, it's water that cycles from ice to steam.
 On Titan, it's methane. Methane gurgles up from the ground in liquid
 form and flows into lakes. It freezes in spots, or floats off as gas in orange clouds. This
 image shows a flash of sunlight reflecting off a sprawling 400,000 square kilometer lake
 known as Kraken Mare. Scientists consider Titan to be a possible
 mirror of Earth in its early days with the chemistry of life still in its earliest stages.
 That's why they are so eager to explore its varied landscapes. So far, radar passes by
 Cassini have revealed expansive dune fields, wetlands, hilly terrain, and the occasional
 crater. Scientists mapped an area near Titan's south
 pole called Sikun Labyrinthus. The image shows a network of canyons and cliffs sculpted by
 liquid methane. Nearby, methane flows into a lake called Ontario
 Lacus. A little smaller than Lake Michigan, it's bounded by bays, river deltas, beaches,
 and other familiar features.  And here, in a region called Sotra Facula.
 Cassini mapped what looks like a volcano. Thousand meter high peaks tower over craters
 that are 1500 meters deep. Are these features the result of an internal
 heat source, like the grooves that line Enceladus and Europa? Or is Titan's story unique? Cassini has been sending a stream of images
 and data across nearly a billion and a half kilometers to Earth. It has been able to draw
 an impressive portrait of a ringed planet, a turbulent gas giant. Cassini's sensors captured a storm that raged
 across Saturn's southern hemisphere for months - generating lightning strikes thousands of
 times more powerful than those on Earth. They documented a giant cyclone spinning around
 at Saturn's south pole. Its eye is so big you could drop the entire continental United
 States into it without touching the cloud walls. Cassini radioed back unprecedented new details
 of Saturn's most famous feature, its rings. In the year 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo
 Galilei discovered these broad, flat concentric bands. But he didn't realize they were actually
 rings, nor had he any clue how intricate they are, or where they came from. Until recently, the reigning theory held that
 the rings were made up of debris from a small moon destroyed in a collision. But they are
 now known to be 99.9% water ice. How it got there seems to reach back again to Greek myth. Fearing vengeance from the offspring of Uranus,
 Saturn began to savagely devour the young titan offspring. The youngest, Zeus, escaped
 unharmed and later on would lead an insurrection by the Olympian Gods. A recent study suggests that Saturn's rings
 formed when the planet swallowed one of its moons. In the process, its gravity stripped
 the moon of its icy surface, which remained in orbit and spread out to form the rings.
 And from the rings, smaller, ice moons like Enceladus took shape. The Hubble Space Telescope showed that Saturn's
 rings stretch more than 240,000 kilometers across. Yet in some places they are as little
 as 10 meters thick. If you were to shrink Saturn down to the size of a basketball, the
 rings would be about 1/250th the thickness of a human hair. Around Saturn everything acts upon everything
 else. Moons and countless tiny moonlets pull and tug on ring particles - shaping and twisting
 and clearing lanes, in a dance of twilight moons. The medium-sized moon Mimas, orbiting
 close in to Saturn, has hollowed out a large gap called the Cassini Division. Some tiny moons ride within the rings. Prometheus
 and Pandora actually hold the F-Ring in line. Other moons continually sculpt the rings,
 gently shepherding the granules with their gravity. And across the ring plane, spokes of different
 colored dust occasionally cling like strands of hair on a cold dry day. Like the rings,
 Saturn's moons each tell a different story, drawing us in for a closer look. There's dense
 little Dione, hard rock covered with ice, pummeled on one side by asteroids that left
 a system of craggy cliff faces. Hyperion: looks like a sponge. It's an oddly-shaped
 world that tumbles chaotically. Iapetus: with one hemisphere brighter than
 snow and the other darker than tar. A strange ridge, like the spine of a rhino, runs around
 its equator. It's the moons Titan, and Enceladus that continue to steal the show. Compared to many of its sister moons, Enceladus
 has fewer craters. Even the largest is relatively small, only 35 kilometers across. Like Europa,
 its landscape is fractured and wrinkled, a sign that it's constantly being reshaped by
 geologic activity. Enceladus lies outside of Saturn's bright
 inner rings, in the wide and diffuse E Ring. With Cassini's camera pointed at just the
 right angle to the sun, the E Ring lit up. Enceladus is the bright object in the center
 of the frame. What is all this hazy material made of? Could it be coming from the moon
 itself? The Cassini science team suspected that they
 were onto something big. So they went to work: plotting new orbital paths, building a new
 target list, and preparing to pay Enceladus a visit. They set the spacecraft on course for a series
 of close flybys of its south pole, down to about 25 kilometers above its surface. This
 is what Cassini saw: plumes of vapor rising out of the ice. Scientists began to think of them as geysers,
 much like those in geologic hot spots on earth. If the team could find out what these jets
 are made of, they might just have some clues to what's going on below the surface. Flying through the E Ring, Cassini sampled
 particles within it. It found crystals of water, and within them, it detected the presence
 of a compound well known on Earth: salt. Salt dissolved in water is evidence that friction
 from a rocky core, jostled by Saturn's gravity, warms a reservoir of liquid water below the
 icy surface of Enceladus. Another flythrough found water molecules that
 are negatively charged. On Earth, that's a product of waves smashing a shoreline or water
 flowing over a waterfall. And there's even more to get excited about. The plumes were
 found to contain nitrogen, likely given off by ammonia heated to nearly 600 degrees Celsius. Here's a diagram illustrating the possible
 set up. Powering the geysers is an underground reservoir heated and pressurized by an internal
 heat source. Close in observations of Enceladus show the disfiguring effect of all this activity
 on its south pole. How amazing that even out here, about nine
 and a half times the distance between Earth and the sun, this frozen little moon might
 just harbor the conditions needed to turn chemistry into biology. If Enceladus holds its secrets in, those of
 Titan are written on its surface. Scientists fed data from Cassini's radar instrument into
 computer models designed to explore the relationship between its surface and its interior. Their
 findings suggested that Titan's interior has been steadily cooling. That has caused the
 moon to shrink, and its surface to wrinkle into a pattern of ridges and valleys. In addition, a recent NASA study found little
 evidence that an internal heat source is currently shaping Titan's surface. The study found that
 most of its features can be explained by impacts, or by this moon's surprisingly active weather. For eight years, astronomers at the Gemini
 Telescope in Hawaii had been monitoring infrared light streaming in from the Saturn system.
 For the first time, on Titan, they saw evidence of a massive storm erupting over what's thought
 to be a vast equatorial desert. Cassini has picked up clouds swirling above large methane
 lakes and seas on the North Pole. And now along the equator, in the large arrow-shaped
 cloud formation to the left. Notice the dark regions in the center of the moon. These are
 thought to be from methane rain drenching the landscape. The clouds likely formed in
 the recent change of seasons as the sun began to shine directly down on Titan's equator. It may not be completely crazy to imagine
 primitive forms of life arising out of this cold carbon-rich chemistry. One theory is
 that ultra-violet light from the sun could zap nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere,
 creating a kind of organic smog that could settle into volcanically active places along
 the surface, and develop from there. Meanwhile, Cassini keeps adding to its historic
 collection of data and images. With Saturn moving into its farthest point from the Sun,
 its rings lay flat on the plane of the solar system. The angle of the light allowed objects to
 cast long shadows across the rings, like this little moon, never before seen. Or these moons
 that seem to have punched through the F Ring. Cassini completed its primary mission back
 in 2008. Based on all its successes, it's now set to keep padding its amazing record
 until at least the year 2017. At this point, no one can say whether Saturn's
 moons have ignited the spark of life. They have certainly ignited our imaginations. 6"
moonlanding,"Into the Unknown tells the story of the building of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope – a revolutionary observatory, 100 times more powerful and the scientific successor to the Hubble Telescope. When launched, Webb will reveal a universe we have never seen before and is poised to answer questions that have intrigued us for thousands of years: How did the universe begin? Where did we come from? Are we alone? Armed with dynamic scenes of construction, fascinating conversations with scientists and engineers and stunning visuals, Into the Unknown offers an in-depth look at one of the most daring scientific missions ever attempted. A story for all ages, this film captures the wonder of the cosmos and the timeless human desire to understand our place within the universe. 

The Northrop Grumman Foundation, in partnership with filmmaker Nathaniel Kahn, developed this documentary as a resource for teachers, students and space enthusiasts around the world to enjoy.

#NorthropGrumman",Into the Unknown,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLD9LKq0u9E,0,542249,5203,401,899,FLD9LKq0u9E,"We tried some things that many people said was impossible. But we've achieved that. And we wish Hubble the very best. The Hubble Space Telescope achieved its greatest performance yet, looking for when and how the universe began. With the Hubble we made incredible discoveries. We measured the age of the universe The discovery of dark energy was actually confirmed by Hubble People argued about whether black holes were in the center of the galaxies. We found black holes everywhere. It told us amazing things. But as we looked deeper and deeper and deeper with the Hubble Space Telescope we come to the end of what the Hubble can see. We just see darkness. And we realized we should build the largest space telescope humanity has ever conceived of This is the next-generation space telescope. It's Hubble 2.0. And we have 1,000 people working on this project right now. So, when that all comes together on a launch pad. If it works, it's going to see deeper into space than any other telescope in history. The Webb Telescope is 100 times more powerful than Hubble. Telescopes keep getting bigger because the bigger they are the more light they can collect and the better the resolution. You know, at some point you build a telescope that's too big to fit in a rocket. The James Webb would not fit in a rocket. So we had to make the primary mirror into individual segments Learning how to build a segmented telescope, this is new. It's been done on the ground once or twice, but doing it in space is a whole other set of challenges because the mirrors have to be lightweight. You have to figure out how to align the mirrors in space. We wouldn't have built a telescope this big unless we needed to. And you need to build a telescope this big if you want to look at the very dimmest, most earliest galaxies in the universe. If you took one of the mirrors and you spread it out the size of the United States, there would be no hill or valley that's larger than three inches, to give you some idea of just how perfect these surfaces need to be. These mirrors are going to literally watch the universe light up after the Big Bang. They will help us learn about the beginnings of galaxies, the beginnings of stars and exoplanets, planets orbiting other stars. These mirrors are going to capture the very first light of the universe. Observation is everything. Ultimately, science is about observation. Like Galileo, when he lifted his telescope to the stars for the very first time, there's not turning back from that moment. He looks at the moon, and this is supposed to be this perfect orb. But it had rocks and craters and was far from perfect. And then he looked at Venus. It had crescents that changed as they moved across the sky. He looked at Jupiter, and he noticed these pinpricks of light. And as he watched them over the weeks and the months he realized these weren't stars. These were actually moons in orbit around Jupiter. And of course he realized that Ptolemy was wrong. Copernicus was right. We were no longer the center of our solar system. The sun was. The church could no longer argue that everything had to be centered around the Earth. Observation trumped ancient wisdom. And that's what science does. It makes irreversible changes in our worldview. At the beginning, when I first came on to work on JWST, it wasn't wasn't terribly straightforward for me to keep track of which orientation was what. Okay, which direction was J3 and J2 and J1 again? You would sit at a conference room with people, and they would grab like a stapler and go, okay, this is the spacecraft, you know, and then here's my instrument, and then this and it just seemed a little silly. Which way is it pointing? And so, I brought in my Lego set one day and went, build it. Let's build it I think everybody want to do something, be a part of something greater than just, what they can do alone. Building something like JWST is that. So, what I don't understand is why everybody isn't trying to do it, trying to be you know, an engineer, work on these these big projects, becoming scientists, you know. I mean, I don't know. What else would you want to do with your life? The Hubble Deep Field was a pure discovery. It was, we don't know what's there. Let's see if we can see something. The second director of the Hubble Space Telescope said, you know, Hubble is looking deeper and deeper into the universe. I wonder what happens if we just stare at a completely blank piece of sky and just see what we find. And so, he decided to point the telescope at a single blank piece of the sky no bigger than a drinking straw. That's the area of the sky he decided to look at with the Hubble Space Telescope and just stare at that single blank spot for ten days and see what would happen. A lot of people said he was crazy. He was wasting telescope time. But the telescope orientated and just stared at that one spot for ten days with our most sensitive cameras at the time. And to everybody's surprise, when they looked at the image, out of that dark area of the sky came 10,000 galaxies in that single point of sky. Nobody had any idea there was this many galaxies in the observable universe. When you look at the Hubble Deep Field, only three of those points of light are stars. Every other point of light in that image is a galaxy. So, there are 10,000 galaxies in every spot in the sky the size of a drinking straw. There are roughly 100 billion stars in the galaxy. If you do the math across the whole sky, its 1022 stars in the observable galaxy. And I am not going to work out how many- what that is, but it's 10 with 22 zeroes. It's larger than even the US debt, you know? That Hubble deep image is what inspired the James Webb Space Telescope originally. When people think about the telescope they think of the huge mirror. Right? That's the iconic part of the telescope. But this is what the astronomers care about. This is where the data comes from, the detectors and the cameras. All the images and the spectra, all the good stuff it'll come from there. You know, it's a billion dollars' worth of hardware in there. So, this is the first time you're going to go cryo-test the four instruments all together, put together, in one place. And the IEC, which is your instrument electronics compartment, all of it's together. This is the space environmental simulator. And so they're putting it in for thermal vacuum testing. Launch is not the greatest stress for this telescope. It's actually going to the cryogenic temperatures. The temperature we're going to is 40 Kelvin. 0 Kelvin is absolute zero. What happens at absolute zero? Oh, the universe stops. All the physics changes at cryogenic Things that expand contract. Things that contract expand, for instance. So you don't know how these things are going to do until they get there. While it's roughly room temperature out here, it's just like space on the other side of this wall. What would happen to a human being in this cryo chamber? Oh, they'd die. You would blow up as the pressure goes down. So, you'd explode. If you survived that, then when the nitrogen goes in, well, you die of asphyxiation. Fundamentally, the telescope is a time machine. The telescope is always a time machine because your eye is a time machine. You can see things as they were when they sent light to you. It takes 2.5 seconds for light to go from here to the moon and back. You see the sun as it was 500 seconds ago, about 8 minutes We're six feet apart, so you're seeing me six nanoseconds bef.., as I was six nanoseconds before you see me. So, light travels at the speed of one foot for nanosecond in round numbers. You see the Andromeda Nebula as it was about 3 million years ago, and that's about as far as you can see without a telescope. But with a telescope you can see billions and billions of light years out in space, so billions and billions of years back in time. Of course, by now they're much farther away than they were when we saw them. So, those things are not there anymore. They have gone on to do something else. Some parts of the universe we'll never see because they're accelerating away from us now. So, they're going to accelerate away so far that the light from them will never get here. As we look deeper and deeper and deeper, We see fewer and fewer galaxies. It is not that we're running out of galaxies. It was the fact that as the universe is expanding and stretching across space and time, its light has been red-shifted. And the galaxies from the very early universe have been shifted out of the view, of the Hubble Space Telescope. The Hubble Telescope can only see what you can see with your eye, the wavelengths that your eye is sensitive to plus a little bit of ultraviolet and a little bit of infrared. Those galaxies are so far away from us that as light travels through space and space is expanding because the universe is expanding, the light gets red-shifted. So, it changes from blue light into red light as it travels through space. It's so far away from us and so far back in time, its light only reaches us via infrared wavelengths. The Webb is going to give us infrared eyes, and we'll see a part of the universe we've never seen before. The Hubble Space Telescope has transformed our knowledge of the universe. But we haven't been able to study the first galaxies that formed in the universe. We haven't been able to find their light. And that's what the James Webb Space Telescope would provide. We can fill in one of the biggest missing pieces. When did the first stars and galaxies turn on? We'll detect the first light that formed from the first stars and galaxies in the universe. We have enough sensitivity with our telescope and our Instruments to detect a child's nightlight located on the moon. You could see things on the order of a candle, a match, a lit cigarette. I know that if you were to certainly take your radiant heat, which for a human is about 80 to 100 watts, and stick it on the moon, we would easily be able to detect that. It can even pick up the heat of a bumblebee. That is completely astonishing to me, even knowing that that's our telescope and we built it that way. Yes, I've heard that. In fact, I was asked about it. I'd have to sit down and do the math very, very carefully. I've learned one does not argue with Nobel Prize winners unless you're 300% certain that you're correct, although I'm quite certain you can see the night light. I heard about this calculation. I checked it myself. I believe it's correct. Yeah. If we had the moon here and the Earth, 250,000 miles, what we need to do first is calculate the area of the sphere. Four Pi, four times 10 to... something like 1.5 approximately 1.5 milliwatts. 1.5 milliwatts If our insect were radiating that much, and I don't- I'm not a biologist, not an entomologist, eto.. entomologist don't know exactly how much an insect radiates, but that doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility. A bumblebee gives off how much energy? Well, let's see. It gives off about 50 milliwatts of power. It does seem reasonable that you can see a bumblebee on, on the moon with our telescope. And 50 milliwatts of power at 250,000 miles Yeah is measureable? Yeah, it’s measureable. That's a bumblebee as opposed to a yellow jacket as opposed to a hornet, but we could collect the light. I should know better than to argue with our chief scientist. You have to take a time exposure to get something that sensitive. The bumblebee shouldn't move. The bumblebee has to hold still? Yeah, the bumblebee has to hold still. But of course the most distant universe looks like it's standing still. We don't want the telescope portion of the Webb Telescope to see any of the sun the light that we're looking at are in the infrared. So, in order to detect heat signature, infrared signature, it obviously needs to be very cold, or all its going to measure is just itself, basically. So, we need to keep it very cold. And in space really the only thing that'll heat it up is the electronics that you've got in and the really bright source which is the sun. The telescope is generally kept around 30 Kelvin, so that's very, very, very cold. God, you know, I have no idea what it is in Fahrenheit. Yeah I don't really work in Fahrenheit very well. 30 Kelvin, wow, how do we- 30 Kelvin in Fahrenheit, okay. 30 Kelvin is -405 Fahrenheit. So, let's just say coldest ever on Earth, Okay the lowest temperature on Earth ever recorded is -135 degrees Fahrenheit. So this is, just about three times, three times, colder than that. Layer 1 is running about 212 degrees Fahrenheit. And layer 5 on the cold side is running about -400 degrees Fahrenheit. So, there's approximately 600 degrees or so between the two, between layer 1 and the layer 5. So, this sun shield is a really, really, really, good SPF. It's about a million. There's nothing I can say that can come close to describing how technically difficult this telescope is. We are at the verge of impossible. This is an engineering marvel. It's not actually necessarily just a scientific marvel because we've built big telescopes before. I built an eight-meter telescope on the ground. We used 300 tons of steel to build this telescope. Well, there's no way to launch a telescope of that scale into space. The James Webb weighs six metric tons. We have to go from 300 tons down to six tons. There's no rocket big enough to launch anything this big. So we then have to work out how to fold this telescope up. We had to create this origami telescope. Even the launch has to be perfect. As we launch this thing, the air must actually come out of all the sun shields in precisely the right way. The actual spacecraft must rotate at just the right rate so we don't fry the delicate structures and electronics because the sun is powering down at one side. And as it leaves the atmosphere it must be in exactly the right trajectory to actually hit the orbit in the right place beyond the moon. If it doesn't, we'll run out of fuel and the spacecraft will only have four or five years of life. There are are over 300 or 400 different operations that have to occur to make this telescope actually come to life. The huge sun shade has to deploy, which is the size of a tennis court. At this point things get pretty critical because now everything starts to cool quickly. So now we've got to get the telescope unfolded before it gets too cold and the joints freeze up. Then we've got to get the mirrors unfolded. We've then got to get the instruments started. And each one of these things has to work perfectly the first time. We've got one shot to get this telescope right. The slightest thing goes wrong, and this mission can fail. We lived in Florida. And I could see the Apollo launches from our backyard. We could see them as they cleared the horizon and up into the clouds. Then we'd run inside to look at the black and white television to see NASA simulation of what was happening. And for me that was it. That's when I knew that I wanted to be involved in the space industry. We were exploring another world. In the 1960s another world was the moon. So now this is the opportunity to go and look for planets. around other stars. James Webb is going to enable us to look at exoplanets, to observe planets around other stars, to really understand their characteristics. We don't know yet what we're going to discover. But we have the instrument that's going to help us really understand those planets. Another Earth is undoubtedly out there. In our Milky Way galaxy we have hundreds of billions of stars. Our own universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies. To me, personally, it is definitely there. We believe that every star in our Milky Way galaxy should have at least one planet. And we're hoping to find and identify a pool of transiting planets and habitable zones of small stars. We call it the Goldilocks zone, not too hot and not too cold but just right for life. We're betting on the fact that nature delivers, that nature has created many rocky planets and that life can originate and evolve anywhere given the chance. And we're, we're planning on finding it. The James Webb is going to revolutionize exoplanet atmosphere studies. We'd like to find water vapor because water vapor in a small planet indicates a liquid water ocean. All life on Earth needs liquid water. It's a great place to start to identify a habitable world. We'd like to see carbon dioxide. It indicates that it's truly a rocky world. But beyond water vapor and carbon dioxide what we'd really like to find are gases that don't belong. Here on our own Earth we have oxygen. But without plants and other photosynthetic life, we would have virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere. If we're lucky, and that would be literally like winning the lottery five times in a row, if there are planets around every small star and there are many of those in the habitable zone and if all of those have life on them and if that life- half of it, let's say- produces gases, we actually have a shot at detecting that with the James Webb Space Telescope. We have the shot at finding life for the first time in human history with the James Webb Space Telescope. We push the state of the art because we want to see what's at the outer edges of what's possible and then we push a little farther Okay, minus J mid, MTS full deployment, layer 1 What's actually happening here is all five layers are being tensioned up one at a time, basically, four quadrants, so we start over here. What are you guys observing? Anything? What's that noise? There is big trouble with the $2 billion Hubble Space Telescope tonight. Grim-faced officials had to reveal that the photo system on board the Hubble telescope is sick. But Hubble doesn't focus properly. One of the mirrors on the Hubble Space Telescope was designed to the wrong specifications. Hubble is actually only eight minutes away. It only takes the shuttle eight minutes to get to the orbit. And so, you can go fix it. And in fact astronauts went back several times to do so. The Webb, on the other hand, is four times further than the moon. And there's no way to go fix it. The Hubble orbit is approximately 300 miles above the Earth. The limit that Man has been away from Earth in the history of the species, that, that record is- I think about 100 miles or so beyond the moon, which was achieved by the crew of Apollo 13 on their emergency return. That's the furthest away Man has been from Earth in the entire history of our species. The L2 point is out here And that of course is one million miles from Earth. We don't want to blind ourselves. And this makes us put the satellite far enough away from the Earth so that it's not influenced by the heat coming from Earth. We're not going in and out of the sun. And so this drives us to orbit the so-called Earth-sun L2 point a million miles away from the Earth and away from the sun. So, we can't afford a mistake because out at L2 the repair man doesn't make a house call. We don't get that second chance. It's a one strike and you're out business. We have to hit the pitch out of the park, all the way out of the park, a million miles out of the park. Layer 5 on 3 2 1 We're there. Wow, it looks good, huh? This is prettier than my imagination. It's really beautiful. This is years in the in the making. This hundreds of man-years of work. I don't think it's possible to overstate how exciting this, this is. How is that? Wow. Wow, it looks good. It looks fantastic. All right. Imagine you are the telescope looking out on the universe, looking out on the stars. We're going to launch this incredibly complex telescope. We're going to pack it up in a rocket. shoot it out and watch it unfold. These instruments will eventually travel a million miles from us carrying the dreams and the curiosity of the planet out there. 20 years ago the planets in our solar system were the only known planets in the universe. It took a telescope to show in fact that there are planets everywhere. It gives us new eyes to penetrate completely unknown regions. We could have our first shot of actually finding signs of life on another world. We'll see the first galaxies, the first stars. We are the only ones like us, that we know about, but certainly we're very curious, to know if there are others. We're more curious, than we have answers. And I think it will always be so. If we found a planet with life, honestly any life, it would be very exciting. But the most exciting thing is is intelligent life. Can we find them? I think we will. In my lifetime? God I hope so, I want to know, you know? Through astronomy we have taken things that were the topic of science fiction and seen them in reality. When I go and give talks to to school kids I'll tell them that one of you will be the first person to step onto Mars. We're going to look up into these beautiful pillars of creation but actually see creation happen because we'll be able to stare through the dust and see the formation of planetary systems and stars. But the real excitement for James Webb will be the things that we didn't anticipate. Whenever you go into the unknown, you discover things you didn't expect. And those of course are going to be the most interesting of all. When they first built the Hubble, there were four or five things that people predicted they would see. The amazing thing today is if you write down what Hubble's ten, top ten discovers are of, only one or two of those things are there. We didn't know about dark energy. We didn't know about galaxy evolution. We didn't know about exoplanets. Those are discoveries that the Hubble revealed. The James Webb, we don't know what we're going to see because we've never observed in this region before, to this depth before. And every time we've done this as a species we've discovered new things. The James Webb Space Telescope is not just a machine built by engineers and scientists, it's taking humanity on a journey."
moonlanding,"The Greenland ice sheet is massive, mysterious -- and melting. Using advanced technology, scientists are revealing its secrets for the first time, and what they've found is amazing: hidden under the ice sheet is a vast aquifer that holds a Lake Tahoe-sized volume of water from the summer melt. Does this water stay there, or does it find its way out to the ocean and contribute to global sea level rise? Join glaciologist Kristin Poinar for a trip to this frozen, forgotten land to find out.

Physics homework requires taking breaks, and Wikipedia was relatively new,
 so I took a lot of breaks there. I kept going back to the same articles, reading them again and again, on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland. How cool would it be to visit these places and what would it take to do so? Well, here we are on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane operated by NASA flying over the Greenland ice sheet. There's a lot to see here, but there's more that is hidden, waiting to be uncovered. What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me is that there's liquid water
 hidden inside the ice sheet, because we didn't know that yet. I did learn on Wikipedia
 that the Greenland ice sheet is huge, the size of Mexico, and its ice from top to bottom
 is two miles thick. But it's not just static. The ice flows like a river
 downhill towards the ocean. As it flows around bends, it deforms and cracks. I get to study these amazing ice dynamics, which are located in one of the most
 remote physical environments remaining on earth. To work in glaciology right now
 is like getting in on the ground floor at Facebook in the 2000s. (Laughter) Our capability to fly airplanes
 and satellites over the ice sheets is revolutionizing glaciology. It's just starting to do for science what the smartphone
 has done for social media. The satellites are reporting
 a wealth of observations that are revealing new hidden facts
 about the ice sheets continuously. For instance, we have observations
 of the size of the Greenland ice sheet every month going back to 2002. You can look towards the bottom
 of the screen here to see the month and the year go forward. You can see that some areas
 of the ice sheet melt or lose ice in the summer. Other areas experience snowfall or gain ice back in the winter. This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsed
 by an overall rate of mass loss that would have stunned
 a glaciologist 50 years ago. We never thought that an ice sheet could
 lose mass into the ocean this quickly. Since these measurements began in 2002, the ice sheet has lost so much ice that if that water were piled up
 on our smallest continent, it would drown Australia knee-deep. How is this possible? Well, under the ice lies the bedrock. We used radar to image the hills,
 valleys, mountains and depressions that the ice flows over. Hidden under the ice sheet are channels
 the size of the Grand Canyon that funnel ice and water
 off of Greenland and into the ocean. The reason that radar
 can reveal the bedrock is that ice is entirely
 transparent to radar. You can do an experiment. Go home and put
 an ice cube in the microwave. It won't melt, because microwaves, or radar, pass straight through the ice
 without interacting. If you want to melt your ice cube,
 you have to get it wet, because water heats up easily
 in the microwave. That's the whole principle
 the microwave oven is designed around. Radar can see water. And radar has revealed
 a vast pool of liquid water hidden under my colleague Olivia, seven stories beneath her feet. Here, she's used a pump to bring some of that water
 back to the ice sheet's surface. Just six years ago, we had no idea
 this glacier aquifer existed. The aquifer formed when snow melts in the summer sun and trickles downward. It puddles up in huge pools. From there, the snow acts as an igloo, insulating this water
 from the cold and the wind above. So the water can stay
 hidden in the ice sheet in liquid form year after year. The question is, what happens next? Does the water stay there forever? It could. Or does it find a way out
 to reach the global ocean? One possible way
 for the water to reach the bedrock and from there the ocean is a crevasse, or a crack in the ice. When cracks fill with water, the weight of the water
 forces them deeper and deeper. This is how fracking works to extract natural gas
 from deep within the earth. Pressurized fluids fracture rocks. All it takes is a crack to get started. Well, we recently discovered that there are cracks available
 in the Greenland ice sheet near this glacier aquifer. You can fly over
 most of the Greenland ice sheet and see nothing, no cracks, no features on the surface, but as this helicopter
 flies towards the coast, the path that water would take
 on its quest to flow downhill, one crack appears, then another and another. Are these cracks filled with liquid water? And if so, how deep
 do they take that water? Can they take it to the bedrock and the ocean? To answer these questions, we need something
 beyond remote sensing data. We need numeric models. I write numeric models
 that run on supercomputers. A numeric model
 is simply a set of equations that works together to describe something. It can be as simple
 as the next number in a sequence -- one, three, five, seven -- or it can be a more complex
 set of equations that predict the future based on known conditions in the present. In our case, what are
 the equations for how ice cracks? Well, engineers already have
 a very good understanding of how aluminum, steel and plastics
 fracture under stress. It's an important problem in our society. And it turns out
 that the engineering equations for how materials fracture are not that different
 from my physics homework. So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice, and then I had a numeric model
 for how a crevasse can fracture when filled with water from the aquifer. This is the power of math. It can help us understand
 real processes in our world. I'll show you now
 the results of my numeric model, but first I should point out that the crevasse is about
 a thousand times narrower than it is deep, so in the main panel here, we've zoomed in to better see the details. You can look to the smaller
 panel on the right to see the true scale
 for how tall and skinny the crevasse is. As the aquifer water
 flows into the crevasse, some of it refreezes
 in the negative 15 degree Celsius ice. That's about as cold
 as your kitchen freezer. But this loss can be overcome if the flow rate in from
 the glacier aquifer is high enough. In our case, it is, and the aquifer water drives the crevasse
 all the way to the base of the ice sheet a thousand meters below. From there, it has a clear path
 to reach the ocean. So the aquifer water is a part of the three millimeters
 per year of sea level rise that we experience as a global society. But there's more: the aquifer water
 might be punching above its weight. The ice flows in complex ways. In some places, the ice flows very fast. There tends to be water
 at the base of the ice sheet here. In other places, not so fast. Usually, there's not water
 present at the base there. Now that we know the aquifer water
 is getting to the base of the ice sheet, the next question is: Is it making the ice itself
 flow faster into the ocean? We're trying to uncover these mysteries
 hidden inside the Greenland ice sheet so that we can better plan
 for the sea level rise it holds. The amount of ice
 that Greenland has lost since 2002 is just a small fraction
 of what that ice sheet holds. Ice sheets are immense, powerful machines
 that operate on long timescales. In the next 80 years, global sea levels
 will rise at least 20 centimeters, perhaps as much as one meter, and maybe more. Our understanding
 of future sea level rise is good, but our projections have a wide range. It's our role as glaciologists
 and scientists to narrow these uncertainties. How much sea level rise is coming, and how fast will it get here? We need to know how much and how fast, so the world and its communities can
 plan for the sea level rise that's coming. Thank you. (Applause)"

 my cleanse. I am full of toxins.    Ah, yes!
    Good old, bad old toxins. The wellness industry tells us
   they're terrifying,  they're inside of us,
   and we need their high-priced help
 to get 'em out.  Is your blood toxic? Toxic blood can affect    every organ in your body,   and it's happening
 to millions of people. If you're feeling tired  and bloated,    then Lee Haney's
 seven-day detox program is just what you need.   (announcer)
  Detox Foot Pads will restore
  balance to your body, stimulate your system,
    draw out toxins, improve your blood circulation.     You'll feel rejuvenated.    But the truth is,
    that's an all-natural...    (glass shatters)  Herbal-strength myth. No way.
 These things work. Look. (footpad rips) That's toxins.    Nope!
    That's color-changing fabric.  And a straight-up scam.  (tense musical sting)  Despite what wellness companies say, as a matter of basic physiology,
    it's pretty much impossible to suck toxins out
 through your skin. Well, then I'll just sweat them
 out in the steam room. Also not possible. I'm never one to turn down
 a nice shvitz, but ask a scientist and they'll
 tell you sweat is...  (beeping and chimes)   99% water. Sweat is your body's
 temperature control, and that's it. Detox just isn't
 your skin's job.   Okay, then I'll just drink
   a ton of water. Hydration is great
 for flushing toxins out. Sorry!
 Science says, ""Nope!"" (steam hissing)   (bottle clatters on floor) What about massages?  Deep breathing?
  Cupping?    Please tell me cupping works,
    in the name of all  that is Chrissy Teigan. (pops)    What?   So how do I get toxins out of me? I've been stress-eating
 fast food  and touching plastic all week
 trying to finish this article, and now there are evil,
 little particles inside of me and they're slowly killing me. Ah!
 Graphics have toxins too.   Hate to burst your bubble,   but that's not how
   it works at all. The fact is, toxins aren't even
 a special type of chemical.   It's just become
   a trendy buzzword.   The truth is that anything
   can be toxic    if you ingest too much of it.  Eat too much vitamin C?
  That's a toxin.  Overdose on fiber?
  Uh, that's a toxin!    Drink too much water?
    You better believe-- I get it! Okay. Luckily, your body comes
 naturally equipped   with the world's
   most effective detox products.    Your internal organs!    (dramatic musical sting) Footpads were
 a lot less gross. If you have harmful levels
 of a substance in your body,   your liver, kidneys,
   and lungs naturally filter it, and then flush it out
 in your pee-pee and poo-poo.   (toilet flushing) Um, weird that you call it that. But wait,
 if toxins come out in my...    Pee-pee and poo-poo. Then I will just--  I'll speed that up.
  I will get a colon cleanse. Oh, no.    Not that. Your impacted fecal matter is
 causing a lot of toxic blockage, so we'll gently flush it out
 by shooting 15 gallons of water up your rectum. Perf.
 Let's do it.  Julia, please don't do this. (groans)
 Why not? My friend Basil said getting
 a colonic was life-changing. Well, if you ask any doctor,
 they'll tell you...   Colon cleanses are damaging
   to your intestinal health,   and can even be dangerous.    Oh, Julia,
    this is Dr. Gerry Mullin.    He's a gastroenterologist
   at Johns Hopkins Hospital.   I came as fast as I could.    Julia, some people think   that colon cleanses flush toxic matter out
   of the gut.  However, there is absolutely
 no scientific evidence   that high colonics are good    for your health. The only thing
 they have been proven to cause are awful side effects
 such as nausea   and vomiting and cramping. Then how am I supposed
 to get all of that old-- you know--
 out of me?   You don't need to.   If you have    regular bowel movements,  your fecal matter is expelled
  often enough.   And you don't want
    to force-flush excrement   out of your colon. Fecal matter nourishes    and protects your bowels.   Your body's like a garden.    You want some fertilizer
    in there. Aww, gross. Thanks, Dr. Mullin.   No problem.    And if you need me again,  just turn on the butt signal.   ♪♪    It's like the bat signal
  but for gastroenterologists. See ya.  (flatulence)   ♪♪ Eww."
moonlanding,A rocket is crashed into a lunar crater in hopes of finding ice.,NASA 'Bombs' the Moon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXKZr0OlM3c,0,193307,1094,507,963,lXKZr0OlM3c,right now a NASA satellite and its booster rocket traveling at more than six thousand miles an hour on a collision course with that right there the moon no accident no accident planned this is a planned mission that's right we're going to be watching it live Robin Roberts Diane Sawyer Sam champion all standing by here and by the way they are sending tweets out from the rocket which last said Wow ten minutes away from walking into the mood and we're right Sam that's gonna send up a plume of rock and they think possibly ice and ice will mean water which means yeah that water equals life so what they want to know is if there was ever water on any kind of moon or planet and so this is a good place to start we want to bring in two wonderful observers with us this morning astronaut Buzz Aldrin who's standing by in Washington of course he was one of the first men to set foot on the moon Apollo 11 and also joining us right oh and who's inside the Johnson Space Center in Houston Ryan I'll just start with you are we on time gonna happen soon we are on time we expect we're about let's say a minute away space time from this huge impact and Diane what an impact it will be as you said this rocket weighs as much as an SUV so we all like the moon we look at it at night but we are about to hit it twice with quite the double impact and buzz aldrin what are you going to be thinking as that happens what are you most interested in seeing well I'm probably going to have to look at a replay because I'm gonna be looking at you but I'm very interested in the resolution of exactly what we've been getting from our satellite detectors to give us a little bit more accurate information as to just what is in the vicinity of the impact area okay buzz we're going to we're going to take a moment of silence from all of us and let Mission Control take us right to the moon we should be looking for some signs of the impact on the left most part I would mid-infrared changes the left side of the shadow right below the the dimpled crater the Creator a larger crater rim slices the science make the rate changes mir-1 one hurt Mir to 0.1 hurt over cloudy science clamplight Mir one to one hurts sending Mir one at one hurts and the science team is directing the flight team to adjust the sampling rate of some of the instruments to fit within the one megahertz ready with Mir two at 0.2 0.1 the one megahertz signal limit go flight grant flights in Mir two 0.1 Hertz Mir two 0.1 are sending command it's like confirm receipt of command over copy that payload Ryan Owens what are you hearing right there from the grandpas we're hearing exactly what you're hearing Diane and that is that engineers are trying to figure out a way to make sure we can actually see this impact it's a little unclear exactly what this thing's going to look like like one minute it may be a little more than what it would look like if you drop the pebble in a bunch of sand although as we have seen through that animation this is going to be 350 tons of rock and they hope some ice included in that that will spray out of that crater once impact is made couple of kilometers away this is the last minute before the shepherding spacecraft also impacts the surface of the Moon and the last minute of flight so they're saying they have about one minute left you see we're going to inching closer and closer it's like when you're in school and they would roll out as we approach very rapidly the surface of the cabanas crater and they're just making sure they have a good shot of the crater still uncertain what exactly will be able to see hmm that's an ass equivalent of bars and town musician emoji are change requests and ir-2 to OPR over and Diane we should point out those are infrared pictures of exactly the same thing we were looking at in that black and white in pictures ready commands light then November IR two to OPR Ken so Ryan it has hit and they have an infrared picture but I gather that they're still waiting for the next phase which is the analytical machinery to kick in that's right let me try to explain this there's actually two impacts the one that just happened is the rocket booster that's the thing that weighs as much as an SUV that was the initial hit behind that about four minutes behind it is a satellite that is going to read that debris scan it for any signs of the ice and then that satellite will also hit in exactly the same spot so that will be as we've called it the double impact what would be important with a flight the thermal is the color we would go you would get some heat out of an exposure here we see them we're watching them in Houston applauding obviously relieved that this actually happened how difficult was this mission Buzz wondered can you hear me it's Diane buzz can you hear me no we have lost our connection to it but they could shoot into a crater that's right we will try to get him back later for more reaction but as we say Oh first of its kind we were talking about the fact that the moon itself has hit some 50 times a year I had no idea of this by impact similar to this get is it has no atmosphere right there for everything flying through space just slams into and there were a lot of Twitter questions about a wire we will that harm the moon and again your point is no it gets hit all the time by debris the reason we don't is we have that atmosphere and things get kind of burned up as they get anywhere close to us but there are all the rocks and things flying around they're hitting the moon all the time and we want to learn from that and we will coming out of this we'll have should have some wonderful data things to data to look
moonlanding,"On Monday, May 13, 2019, NASA declared: “We are going to the Moon to stay” by 2024.

It’s an exciting announcement; the return to a place humans haven’t set foot on in more than 45 years. A serious goal that will test the ability of technology and engineering, as well as the bravery of the men and women who will carry out this task.

But we’ve also heard announcements like this before, many times. How will the mission come together? What are the risks? What’s new this time?

 are going to the Moon to stay” by 2024. It’s an exciting announcement; the return
 to a place humans haven’t set foot on in more than 45 years. A serious goal that will test the ability
 of technology and engineering, as well as the bravery of the men and women who will
 carry out this task. But we’ve also heard announcements like
 this before, many times. How will the mission come together? What are the risks? What’s new this time? The White House has been working on its plans
 to send humans to the Moon for several months now, pushed forward by US Vice President Mike
 Pence and NASA’s new administrator Jim Bridenstine. The original plan was to send crewed missions
 to the Moon by 2028. And then several weeks ago, the target date
 of 2024 was floated, and it was met by skepticism, concern, and a little excitement. Returning to the Moon would be amazing. A serious goal, and the next step in becoming
 a space-faring civilization. But we’ve heard sweeping goals like this
 before. We’re going to Mars, we’re going back
 to the Moon, we’re sending humans to an asteroid. We’re building a space station out by the
 Moon. And now, humans to the Moon by 2024. One of the reasons for the 2024 deadline is
 to minimize the chance that a new White House administration would switch goals. Okay, what’s the plan? The name for NASA’s new program is Project
 Artemis, named after the Greek goddess and twin sister of Apollo. Also the name of Andy Weir’s new book about
 a city on the Moon. Coincidence? This new program works with most of the existing
 hardware that’s currently under construction by NASA, but shuffles the schedule around
 a bit. The original strategy was to first construct
 the Gateway in lunar space using the enormous Space Launch System. Future missions would carry humans in the
 Orion spacecraft to the Gateway, which they could then use as a platform for sending astronauts
 down to the surface. Under this strategy, the first astronaut would
 set foot on the Moon in 2028. The new Artemis plan pushes the construction
 of the Gateway back several years, building one core module by 2022, and then using this
 as the stepping stone back to the Moon by 2024. Here’s the new schedule: Over the course of 2019, NASA is going to
 partner with nine US companies to deliver payloads to the Moon. As early as this year, the first missions
 could start sending new science instruments and technologies to the lunar surface. These commercial partnerships will continue
 over the years as NASA continues its lunar exploration beyond 2024. In 2020, NASA’s Exploration Mission-1 will
 launch. This will be an uncrewed flight of the Space
 Launch System carrying an Orion spacecraft into an orbit near to the Moon. Then in 2022 will be Exploration Mission-2. Another launch of the Space Launch System,
 carrying astronauts on a mission around the Moon for the first time in over 50 years. Later in 2022, a commercial partner like United
 Launch Alliance, SpaceX or Blue Origin will launch the first module for the Gateway: the
 power and propulsion element. It’ll have a solar electric propulsion system
 and provide power and communications for the astronauts. In 2023 a rover will be sent to the lunar
 pole, to search for water-ice mixed into the regolith at the Moon’s permanently shadowed
 craters. This will provide more information so that
 future astronauts will be able to live off the land, turning water ice into rocket fuel,
 air to breathe and water to drink. Finally, in 2024 on the third launch of the
 Space Launch System, humans will return to the Moon. They’ll stop in at the Gateway, and then
 take a lunar lander down to the surface near the Moon’s south pole. Over the next few years, astronauts will continue
 with additional missions to the Moon, building up capabilities to attempt missions to Mars
 by the 2030s. Are they serious? Is this actually going to happen? I’ll talk about that in a second, but first

 and get in on the action. This week, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine
 said that NASA was going to need an additional $1.6 billion in funding this year if it’ll
 have any chance of reaching the Moon by 2024. Not only that, but this amount was just a
 downpayment to catch up development to that deadline, and that it would need even more
 funding in the coming years to reach that deadline. This additional budget would set aside $1
 billion for the Human Lunar Landing System. NASA will purchase a commercial lander that
 can transport astronauts from the Gateway to the surface of the Moon and back. Blue Origin’s Jeff Bezos coincidentally
 presented the Blue Moon strategy this week, building a landing system that could put tonnes
 of hardware onto the surface of the Moon. And with an enhanced propulsion system, it
 could even support a crewed lander. It looks like you just got your first customer
 Jeff. It calls for an additional $651 million for
 the Space Launch System and Orion spacecraft, to adapt their development to the new plan. An additional $132 million in exploration
 technologies, like the Gateway’s solar electric propulsion system, and methods of converting
 lunar ice into water. And $90 million for more scientific exploration
 of the surface of the Moon’s polar regions. This means the President’s total budget
 request for NASA will be $22.6 billion in fiscal year 2020, about a billion dollars
 more than Congress approved for 2019. This is a seriously big budget. But is it enough? According to Casey Dreier, from the Planetary
 Society, he and other aerospace engineers estimated that NASA would probably need $4-5
 billion in additional funding every year to reach that 2024 deadline. If there’s one thing we’ve seen, pushing
 the limits of space exploration costs money, and budgets run high. The Space Launch System is already billions
 of dollars over budget, and wasn’t specifically designed with lunar landings in mind. The Office of the Inspector General made a
 detailed investigation and has estimated that the Boeing is expected to spend $8.9 billion
 on SLS through 2021, and delivery of the Core Stage has slipped 2.5 years already. What about the commercial partners? SpaceX just successfully launched the Falcon
 Heavy for the second time, with more launches coming soon. So it does look like there are rockets that
 could assist the Space Launch System in sending the hardware into lunar orbit and down to
 the surface of the Moon. Now you know the plan, and some of the constraints. Is it going to happen? Obviously, we have no idea. Experience tells us that space exploration
 takes longer and costs more than anyone expects. A lot more. I think we’ll know pretty quickly if the
 White House and Congress are serious about this plan if we see the budget increase to
 match the demands for this faster timetable. But if the budgets don’t happen, if construction
 on the Space Launch System stalls, if the commercial partners aren’t ready with their
 hardware. If safety gets compromised in any way, we’ll
 see the timelines slip. This will mean new administrations, changing
 plans, changing priorities and maybe changing destinations. It’s what happens. What do you think? Let me know your thoughts in the comments. Once a week I gather up all my space news

The first pictures were taken from the lunar orbit  It helped map the surface of the moon and select landing sites for Apollo  This is how the Google Moon pits Zeman look like  At coordinates 72 ° 30 '41.04 ""south and 145 ° 30' 29.62"" west  This was the same area with images taken by Lonner Orbiter 5 during 1967  The image shows strange structures on the surface of the moon, which look like mysterious holes  Some believe that these are just errors caused by the image being stretched  Conspiracy theorists question whether the image has been altered in that area  6- UAV or; Moon pictures; Apollo Mission 14 IAS14-70-9836 IAS14-70-9835 IAS 14-70-9837  It was captured by Apollo 14 while it flew over the moon in 1971 before landing on it  This optical phenomenon that appeared in three pictures  To this day the experts have puzzled  At first it was said that the lights were a reflection of the vehicle, but that is not likely  The phenomenon lit up the surface of the moon  As if it were a flying saucer, as some scholars have said that it is a transient lunar TAL phenomenon  It is a light light that does not last long  Adds color or changes the appearance of the moon's surface, but this phenomenon is still a bit mysterious  5- ""The Citadel"" of the Apollo 16 mission; IAS ID 16-121-19438 photos  It was captured by the Apollo 16 spacecraft while orbiting the moon in April 1972  This picture, taken from a tilted angle over a sea of ​​crisis and a sea of ​​calm, showed a strange thing  This image shows large  Pipes rising from between pits  The unusual shape of that body led to the claim that it was a synthetic form  Especially since the shape of another tube about a mile long lies next to it  The Apollo 16 mission was known for the wealth of interesting images it sent  Such an unknown figure that swims over the moon  4- Industrial parts over the moon; Mission: Luna 13; Image ID: Reviews 1 and 2  The Luna 13 mission, on an unmanned Soviet vehicle under the ""Luna Program"", was the third vehicle to land on the Moon  The probe landed in the Oceanis Brussels region on December 24, 1966 and took a series of panoramic photos.  Some showed pictures of strange objects lying on the surface of the moon vaguely  The wheels stuck together are like an axle  Some thought it was the wreckage of an industrial piece of metal belonging to a spacecraft  However, it should be noted that it does not resemble any structural form in the Luna 13 spacecraft  Or for the two previous vehicles that landed on the moon at that time, knowing that they landed in different places  3- ""Observing the movements on the surface of the moon"" The mission: the Lunar Orbiter 5, picture ID: Lu-V-168-H2  On August 17, 1967, this photo was taken by the Loner Orbiter 5  Two objects appear to be moving on the moon's surface  Because of the effect they left on a crater in the moon known as Vitalo  NASA said at first that they were two rocks moved by a meteorite bombardment or small meteorite  But their shape, location, and trajectory raised many doubts about these explanations  Some said that the phenomenon may be similar  The two stones sail mysteriously in Death Valley  They are believed to move at night due to the icy changes beneath them at night in addition to being blown by the wind  But if snow was formed on the surface of the moon  The winds are not there to push the two stones  2- The ""strange triangular shape"" mission: Clementine; Photo ID: mosaic from the near side of the moon  He shed light on this image in 2014  It was picked up by the Clementine expedition in 1994, and it caused a sensation around the world  Taken near an area known as ""Mar Muscovance"".  It can be seen on Google Moon at coordinates 22 ° 42'38.46 ”north 142 ° 34'44.52” west  The images show a pyramid with dimensions equal to approximately 150 x 130 meters or 500 x 420 feet  It is marked by two rows with bright spots along its edges  Some made it think that it looked like a base for an alien or spacecraft  Some said the suspected strange image had been formed  While uploading the images together  1- ""Pyramid on the Moon"" of the Apollo 17 mission; Image ID: IAS17-135-20680  During the last missions of the Apollo spacecraft, the first human being landed on the surface of the Moon as part of the NASA program  The Apollo 17 team took a photo close to an area called Giovone Rock  This picture raised many questions later  It was officially declared ""blank"" in the Apollo 17 photo catalog  Nor does the NASA-ALPI archive on the Internet mention this photo at all  But despite the lights shining in the picture  And after modification, an ambiguous shape will appear  Known as the strange rock of Giovonni  As the hierarchical shape appearing here has raised many questions and has been the subject of controversy"

Destin",The Drill we sent to Mars - Smarter Every Day 143,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qa2sc6-u59I,0,2744451,63042,1244,3536,Qa2sc6-u59I,"Hey it's me Destin welcome back to Smarter Every Day. This is my drill press. Out of all things that humans could send up to Mars on a nuclear powered robot, a drill was one of the most important things we sent. And the reason we did this, well think about this. This is the board and you've seen tree rings right? If we were to drill into this board, and then analyze the shavings that come out of that hole, because of the tree rings we could go back in time and understand what was going on in this board when the tree was younger right? That's exactly why they sent a drill to Mars. We want to understand if there were organic molecules inside the rocks of Mars when they formed. But in order to do that you have to drill below the surface and then analyze the powder. But every article I've ever read about the drill and about how they analyze the powder doesn't really satisfy me. So today on Smarter Every Day I'm at JPL. This is Mark Rober.. Crazy! He's gonna give me a tour of what? - Uh OK. - You missed your cue. - We've gotta start over, he missed his cue. - I just realized.. - This is my buddy Mark. You remember all that fancy rocket business where we descended the curiosity rover down to the Martian surface with these fancy rocket cranes? Yeah he helped work on that. But more importantly he owes me a ton of favors so I asked him if he could introduce me to the people behind the drill on the rover. I wanted to understand exactly how this thing works. - So we are going to the Mars yard, which basically is a simulation of the Martian surface. - Yeah look both ways before you cross the street and go to Mars. - Behold.. Mars! - So this is the Curiosity garage? - Yeah, so they'll bring it out here in the yard You can see here's the tracks. But then when they're just working on something inside they bring it back into the shack. - Wow. Oh man so is this the only one? Is this one of a kind? - It's one of a kind. The only one on planet Earth. - I guess it's two of a kind. I'm Destin, what's your name? - Megan. - Can I shake your hand from a long way away? Nice to meet you Megan. You're running the test? - I'm running it right now, yeah. - That's pretty awesome. He hasn't let you talk at all, but I really want to talk to you but there's a rover in between us. This duplicate of the curiosity rover exists so scientists and engineers can test software and tricky manoeuvres without having to risk damage to actual flight hardware. OK we decided to quit messing around and Megan's actually gonna tell us what the tools are. You know all the tools right? - I know a lot about the drill and the Chimra since I tested them. - Yeah? - So this is kind of the butt end of the drill right here. - Can I walk over there? - You can come over here. - I will. So you're clipped in, right? - I am clipped in.. - To the grounding point, OK. - And so this what you see right here we call Chimra, I have no idea what that acronym is.. - It's basically the tool belt right? - This is the sample processing. - OK I really need to apologize right now, because I started geeking out so hard because I was in the room with the rover, that I forgot I was making a YouTube video. And I started asking questions and they were awesome questions, and then they let me run a command on the mast, and I moved it around. It was incredible. Anyway, I went back and I tried to summarize everything I learned while I was offline in this one take. I'm so sorry. So this is the main mast which is the RSM. Which stands for what? - Remote Sensing Mast. - OK and there's two probes on the side here and these are both for weather. One of them on Mars actively doesn't work at this moment in time. Because it didn't work at landing right? OK so this is the arm here that I'm using to gather samples on Mars, and it uses Megan's drill bit, right, - The official name. - The official name. So that's the drill bit, and it should have enough life to meet our primary objectives on Mars, and after that goes bad for whatever reason if we want some icing on the cake then you've got two extra drill bits located down here that you can autonomously swap out. - Correct. - And that'd be the first time that's ever been done on a different planet. And it's gonna happen cause you worked on it right? - I want it to happen. It would be really awesome to see. - Excellent. So over here, looking at the samples. So before we decide what samples we're gonna analyze by putting them in this little hole right here we can put the samples on the plate, we can measure their size, both by the fiducials there on the checkerboard or by dropping it through that funnel right? - Right. - And then once we do that, we can then, if it meets the critera we can put it in this hole and analyze it. And after you analyze it you dump it overboard. - Yep. - Did I get it all right? - Yep. - You're a good teacher. Clearly Megan's a genius, however there were still some questions that I had. I wanted to understand the exact interaction between drill bit and rock. Which is why I came to see Ryan. What's your title? - Drill systems engineer. - So what's this right here? What do you have? - This is a drill bit assembly. - OK. - This is not only our drill bit, which if you take a closer look this is a masonry bit, it's not like the cutting bits that you have on your handheld carpentry drill. It's more of a chisel and it's designed for impact drilling. - OK. So how does it work? - So first we set our drill, preload our drill stabilizers against the rock to make sure that we have a nice stable configuration. Then we feed forward until we contact the rock. - OK. - We start our drilling operation with a process we call start hole. So if you can imagine, if we're on a rock and not perfectly aligned and there's all these surface features, little divots on the rock, the bit's gonna want to walk around Imagine like if you're trying to cut metal you usually put a little pilot hole before you start drilling. - So you don't break the bit, Is that the same reason you do it here? - Yeah, so we have a process we call start hole that starts the first 5mm of our hole and basically what we're doing is chiselling little divots to carve out an asterisk shape. Then we drill that out and we repeat that process as many times as it takes to get down to 5mm. Then we have a good starting point for the rest of our drilling. It's not the rotation that's really cutting the rock so much, it's really the hammering action. Like a jackhammer and then the rotation we do is mainly for drawing the powder up through the sheath. We continuously drill until we bottom out the drill. Literally we're bumping up the front face of the drill bit assembly against the rock. Before we drill we do a triage, we drill a little bit so we can see what the powder is going to look like because we are worried about if it turns out that this material has, it's hydrated and it's somewhat sticky then it could clog up our drill bit assembly. - Is it, on Mars? - It can be, and that's one of the interesting science findings recently is that there's a water cycle, an active water cycle near the surface of Mars even at Gale Crater. - Do you have any of the drill bits that are outside of the drill head? - Not with me here but I can show you one at my desk if you're interested in seeing what that looks like. I have a 3D printed model of this where the bit itself is metal but the rest of the housing is clear plastic so you can see through. - No way, can we go do that? - Yeah. - So what you drill, you auger the material up into this right, this housing? - Exactly. Yeah into the first of our two chambers within the drill bit assembly. So we have two chambers in the drill bit assembly specifically so that it gives us some freedom to be able to move the robotic arm around without worrying about spilling material back out through the exit tube before we're ready to transfer it. So once we draw it into the first chamber it's in that first chamber until we transfer it through this little slot you can see here. - Yeah. - So we transfer it through that slot. We use percussion to shake things up and we use gravity to control which direction the stuff is going. - So that's the mass flow you were talking about. - Yeah. - Can I pretend to be the robotic arm for a second? - Please. - Yeah OK so basically you've got that slot, and so you want to keep that slot down so you want to go drill, and then you pick it up and as long as that slot's up top then you keep all your sample right? - That's right. - OK and so then at that point whenever you get it to where it needs to go you can then rotate it over and then dump it through that little slot right there into the next chamber? No wait back this way right? - That's right. - OK so you kinda.. - Through the slot to the second chamber. - Almost bumped, almost into your hand like this right? Nope, then you rotate again and it goes out that port. - That's right. - OK so we've drilled our rock and now we've got the powder on the inside of the rock. In a very specific circumstance if you find a special rock and you think you might actually have organic molecules on the inside of that rock, you've got to baseline your instruments. In order to do this, JPL got pretty clever. They put these cans on the front of the rover to be used only in certain circumstances. I'm gonna let Megan explain what they're for. So in these cans there's what's called OCM which is organic check material? - Yep that's right. - OK and so the idea is you have a known sample that you can test on Mars so that you can make sure that your sensors are operating correctly. - Right. - And so that's basically the same thing like the color pallete back there so that you can check that your cameras are working correctly, this is the same thing for your sensors to see if you have life on Mars. - Right, for the instruments. For whatever science tool they want. - So you say that's organic, so that's pieces that were alive? - If you're looking for organics on Mars and you think you've found organics you want to send something that has no organics through and analyze it and make sure you don't see any, and then test the thing that has organics again. - Ohh. So what you're saying is, an organic check material is basically like eating a cracker that the fancy wine tasting guys do, - To clean out the.. - To clean the palate. So that's what that is. This is basically a bunch of crackers that you eat between your samples to make sure you know what's going on. Excellent. The next time you see a perfectly drilled hole in the surface of Mars, don't think about, you know, a drill press or a percussion drill. Think about a precisely executed group of manoeuvres specifically designed to obtain dust. It works like this. You put the drill bit in, you take the drill bit out. You put the drill bit in, and you auger the dust all out. You do the mass transfer by turning Chimra about, and that's how you dump the dust out. I just ruined the hokey pokey for the rest of your life. You are welcome, and I made that up and it's great. YES! I hope you enjoyed this episode of Smarter Every Day, it was brought to you by audible.com. Audible as you know is a really cool way where you can listen to audio books on your phone. Yeah you're smart people, you know where this is going. This is my audible.com library and right here at the top of the list, yep you guessed it, The Martian by Andy Weir. I know there's a movie out, but if you haven't experienced the book you really need to do that. You can get any audio book you want for free at audible.com/smarter. I recommend The Martian because there's way more science in the book than there was in the movie that you probably already watched. if you're sitting here watching a ten minute video about drilling on Mars. Anyway, I'm Destin. Thank you so much for even considering watching ten minutes worth of video on the Internet. I know that's a long time. Anyway, please consider subscribing if this added value to your life. Please consider supporting the sponsor. If not, no big deal. I appreciate you. I'm Destin, you're getting Smarter Every Day. Have a good one. Bye. - Umm.. you cannot do that because of ESD. - Can I.. OK you're grounded right? - So I'm grounded. We have.. - Can I high five you, which is kind of like high fiving the rover cause you're at the same electric potential. Can we do this? No? - That's such a weird question. - Yeah! She's about to let me run a command."

moonlanding,"The moon is looking more full than ever. The director Todd Douglas Miller assembles beautifully restored archival footage, blends that with audio from the astronauts and a vibrant score to create a fresh look at a moment that has been woven into American consciousness. In this scene, Miller discusses his use of split screen to depict the point when the Eagle lunar module separates from the Columbia spacecraft and prepares to land on the moon.

 Douglas Miller. I’m the director
 of “Apollo 11.” So this is a very important
 scene in the film. It’s the moment
 on July 20, 1969, the landing of Apollo 11. This was the first time
 that humanity set foot on another world. We spent a lot of
 time on this scene. It’s really the culmination
 of everyone’s talents, from the sound design to
 Matt Morton’s music score. Even to this animation,
 which was something we decided to utilize,
 which is traditional cell animation. We came across that in
 some industrial films in NASA’s archives.” — from which point the powered descent to the lunar
 surface will be initiated.” “Apollo 11. Houston, we are go
 for undocking, over.” “The landing itself
 was obviously a giant technical hurdle. It involved hundreds
 of thousands of people, but certainly, here, the
 doors in mission control are closed. The three astronauts
 performing these complex maneuvers
 were very much focused on the task at hand. One of the things that
 we chose to utilize, not only here, but
 throughout the film, was the use of split screens. Here, for the first time, the
 two vehicles are separated, Neil Armstrong and Buzz
 Aldrin being on the right, and Michael Collins in the
 command module on the left. As we shift back
 into mission control, we always thought it was
 very important to showcase as many flight controllers
 interjecting as much humanity on screen as possible. So when we have
 these go, no go commands — “ “Go.” “GUIDO.” “Go.” “Guidance.” “Go.” “Control.” “Go.” “Telcom” “Go.” “GNC.” “Go.” “EECOM.” “Go.” “Surgeon.” “Go.” “CAPCOM — “ “These individuals were
 pushing the buttons to make these things
 happen, and we always thought that it would
 be important to showcase as much of these
 people as we could. The on-screen graphics, we
 spent a lot of time working with the historians — 
 and also the astronauts, both Michael Collins
 and Buzz Aldrin — to get that as accurate
 as we possibly could. Neil’s sons Rick and Mark
 also contributed a lot to the making of the film. And then this is one of
 the most famous shots in cinematic history,
 as far as I’m concerned. Buzz Aldrin shot this with
 a 16-millimeter camera out his window, and
 then we in the film show it as an unbroken shot
 to the moment of touchdown. My music composer,
 Matt Morton, decided to do a period score
 using only instrumentation that was around pre-1969. Most notably, he went out
 and got a 1968 edition Moog synthesizer.”"

you haven't getting after these guys that families um I got one on the way so I got a little bit more time working on it yeah your punk ass key is getting away a lot of stuff you love kids so we have two very seasoned veterans here at the table with us these two face a purse too but they've been in bullion your your you are a size 14 the team team holy moly that's 21 as long as she said whoa laughs takes a yes seven years me that's a lot of years dude it is and I have five years of college that no field oh how you feel that now does now you take care of your body huh yeah shoo - so Andre tell us a little bit about how you know Vince first I know you guys never played together but you've played against each other for quite a while well what's your first Vince Carter memory and were you like a little bit of a fan of him yes also I watched Vince I was a Carolina fan so it was stack and she was first so I start watching basketball on a fat five and then once like stacking she was that Carolina I was a crazy Carolina fan damn event Antoine Jamison a Kota fine Elijah yep my car enjoy yeah there was nothing gosh sure my wins mm-hmm yeah a nation wrote a basket Lisa R okay they have five I had six guys and they rotated starter like I remember I wanted to cry when I lost oh I forgot a year your loss and a loss to you talk we lost to you Toto I'm a junior so I won did you breath when the cry was so mad no the first year we lost Bibby in Arizona is the next game was they were doing layups I was still on the bench was like no not yet Danny because we had that we were up and we just who was on a Utah team you goes to Andre Miller Keith van Horn oh and had a big guy in the big head of the redhead Michael Dooley AK microsomia shooting and the squad pros yeah yeah and then Mokhtar had a controversial thing after the game shoot that was done again we got kicked out so he said to do call him and ejected and it was went downhill for us and then Utah played uh contesting the finals and lost Chuck yet I was paying all hey so I've been watching Finch since like easy but in the owner core my first time seeing Vince was uh he dumped on Sam Dalembert and uh in Canada wasn't in Toronto wasn't a Vancouver random place preseason getting he dumped on him he dumped on him so he like split a pic rolled right between the legs backwards and he dunked on Sam I was like a half-court like this it was like what your dorm like man that was cold funny man but um I'll play where I live Orson no so he would tell me like listen man ain't no more of that you big fans in him dudes like they breathe the same air as you do so California no Shh Oh your time like playing with a guy like that's during his rock star right right I mean I think and I was a rock star beating off the court as well right it was crazy and I think his rookie my rookie year was just like most efficient season as far as like points and assists yeah I was like 13 yeah I was like crazy amount of cysts so I was seeing like him dude like like when I hung out with him one night like just to see what it's like to hang out with him bro that's all you have the same thing it was it took one night and he didn't like do anything like crazy like he wasn't like moving around doing uncrazy but he would just be up like just talking he would like to the homies and then you know he have a couple drinks and he's just like talking man when he kind of get like buzzed a little bit he'd get mad emotional face and I'm like we played Detroit Pistons tomorrow like this was a Detroit with Detroit and it was scary playing in there like that was scary arena I can bang me and like Wallace hit me yeah 50 that same room I could not believe it I was like man dude was up to like four or five o'clock in the morning man man he like 50 that night man that's when I was like all the time dude I was a regular there's some more for him yeah so he just doesn't sleep he's just capable just got an operate like that I don't even confusion it catch up to me you can do it for a couple of games or maybe a week where I didn't catch up too and you crash yeah ain't happen to him very often no bad games for him I mean I guess you can consider a crash but what's your craziest AI memory one that on the court on the court on the court oh he had this crazy thing you having all the time where he knew he you know to hit like you guys know the rest like superstars no the refs in high British it with this one verse that one whenever used on the sidelines and it was one of them guards that would decide to pick him up full court and he was like oh this guy won't play hard he will try to pick me on full court yeah I would just dribble along the sideline and it dark touched him he'll just pick the ball up and run out of bounds referee call foul every time so I was like bro how you just picked the ball to run he was like and he's super mother ain't gonna call it on foul they'll call travel on me or cabal they gonna call file and then he gonna start pressuring me to rest of the game I like oh man that's crazy to me that's the worst superstar to guard who knows what they can get away with yes that's that's the hardest to guard or you know play against defensively when they know whatever I do I'm you know it's gonna work in my favor that's just on top of who he was and what he can do like that's hang garlis do it crazy that's nice I literally just take the ball up it just go out of bounds on purpose like man did you go she go call me and it was a foul every time every time there's nuts so wait hold on so y'all y'all going to Denver together though right now we were never here yeah some remember when uh Andre was Endeavor my work year he was saying game winners uh some girl in the state and that's why I told you guys my whole coming off the bench thing was like easy I mean cuz he was the guy that you know he had it all you know he's the man who when Derek came in and go in the state came off the bench finds every piece I'm like eight whatever whatever detainees and I mean he could have been like nah i'm the man i'm gonna start that's what kind of help me my situation a little little bit ease and that's why you know i'm fast for it a little bit it's important to be you know do stuff like that cuz you never know who's watching I mean that's some always you know kind of hung on to do you do you think that affected your mentality like now with coming off the bench and coaches said that you're just whatever you need to do for the team do you think that's kind of set you up for that yeah you know the freedom is a little bit different on a second unit a mess and everything you know the first unit is loaded you know me you know some teams start studded and you know the ball you know you don't really get you know the touches you want so they move it to the bench you playing with a lot of the guys that you know kind of move the ball DeAndre and Jalen you know we got a nice little chemistry going at the 123 so a little bit more freedom out there and a lot more fun so that's a good segment oh when did you guys first meet and what's your first memory together I just remembered ray being so blunt these days like whatever you want style I guess I mean what you need you need stuff like that you know he just came over you know in a new situation and trying to fill everything out you know he didn't really impose his will on the whole locker room just kind of set back and kind of observe and you know we had a couple chats about you know some stuff that was going on a teen you know what guys don't so uh no he was cool you know down earth God and I was I mean I was just like kind of you know not shocked but like yo this guy was you know the man over there all the touches you know triple-double alert and then it would come to a different situation and be as humble as he was you know they gave me a lot of respectful and it's safe to say there's not a lot of guys who can do that or or who are willing to do that for the good of their their team or you know for their career sometimes because you see guys who just aren't willing to do so and you were saying where are they now or hey he should have been right in this league you know like that's what a lot of guys I think you know that's why that's what got me here willing to do whatever to continue to play this game and still reaping all the benefits from it no it's just studying the game loving the game and I think I mean I'm not gonna I don't want to take the words out of your mouth but I feel like that move you know when younger kids they don't even understand the big picture of the alright I'm saying like I think for young guys if you sit back and look at and try to break it down and understand the big picture of it you know what is it what has he gotten from that outside of an MVP rebel championship right exactly which everybody wants yeah and maybe it doesn't work out that way if they they go on a different way you know we don't know that obviously when it was brought up to you how did you feel about it initially because I think it's that initial thing that kind of gets to us before we make our final decision right right yeah right so the reason why I think it works as smoothly as it did is because Steve and I was coached by the same college coach so lute Olson was a coach so we pretty much see basketball the same way like certain principles certain fundamentals certain areas of attack like you do certain things certain weight off and coach off so we I mean we see it the same way you first you'd like shocked and I was shocked because I was playing so well mm-hmm like I said I had like a little procedure done that summer and I was working hard I'm like ooh I'm feeling really good Steve was like you know you bet you had a great camp and like you deserve to be starting and I'm like but I'm like but so I like you like you said it's that shock it's like okay we all human so you kind of have you everyone has their own ego something like Oh what but at the same time like we think in basketball like we always think in basketball like okay why all right it makes sense it makes sense but I'm like man okay I got to figure this out like man you're just thinking about every day but in the back of my mind it would make sense because we see basketball the same way so I'm like oh I get it I get that one for you so you in your fourth year let's say or younger you could you have handle that then no not if I was younger because like when you're younger it's easier for others to seep into your world like that's what I've learned morning anything man like these young guys I be like yo who the hell's give you advice and this you is all those young guys they have that one person where we sit back and be like man you don't get the hell away from that person mm-hmm it's like it's it's everywhere and it needs to be heard yeah and it's like it's hard to tell a guy bluntly like stay with Nega it's a bad person right it can kind of kill their world or mess a fab relationship that messes up another relationship and it's like a nominal fix so you just very fragile so yeah it's like for me it was like you got your agent telling you look we got to get paid you know you got your friends telling you look you better than this guy then you got this guy over here it's just so many moving parts and people just everywhere and it's funny because older you get the smaller the surfaces yeah yeah people don't wear these young guys understands like you only get paid if you win and bro right like viewing the playoffs every year you playing well that's how you get paid yeah like you're gonna frickin 35 on Latino in 17 games and there's nothing nobody bum no you and your people right right yeah yeah I mean you can talk like winning is the best thing ever but we wanted 60 games only 60 games League we want 19 games straight then lose a game in January and like that was like the best time of my life like everything was great going to the Eastern Conference Finals you know playing deep into the playoffs every year you know even playoff checks you know I mean gonna play all checks like playoff series like that stuff a it just it just just nothing like playoff but no nobody knows nothing like it and then you don't get the experience and you sitting home watching it every year year after year after year like you know last year man is so you know start we got off to this year like it's hard you know you keep pushing and you know thankfully the league's in a place now where you know the it basketball isn't really being dominated by teams right now you know it's kind of wide open mm-hmm no I mean so you win you know three or four games in a row no you right back in the thick of things just him and Eve right yeah and he's yeah so I mean that's what keeps you going every day with you know not making the playoffs man it's hard though I've been at least seven years I missed it twice like I love once a play on the road it's the best feeling then on top of that this money time that's why guys earn that's how you're in your chest to me I mean they you so you sure you get the chance to really showcase who you are what you what you are what you're made of right and that's how guys you get paid like it's like like you said be on the bad team scoring points and then going home in April right okay yeah but like you go and watch the playoffs and you watch guys examine money yeah it's coming right Hill where guys like that get a chance you know Hin juries or you know welcome down man I play with some guy getting started plays whirling in his whole career change right everybody that's when you I like to play off people's like it's something different by chewing the playoffs in regular season I can play just brew basket ball come up right walls were supposed to go mm-hmm it's fluid mm-hmm ain't anything nonsense right you gotta treat you got to respect the game right yeah I'd like to place is bright yeah James and East Conference Finals bro like you know cuz the Mara got her child I heard that year and I was guarding a man and do want to talk about like some sleep was nice like you know knowing that you got a guard his man for 30-plus minutes every night is like for me and I was so young it's like my first year I was like you know it's a dream come true one but like good god he's do is like 270 yeah posting every play wait a minute plays like a guard right yeah absolutely you dealt with a lot of that too well the past couple of years with LeBron mm-hmm what was that like for you I mean we think in the same thing like get back man get to the paint man listen man you ain't get no time off as a rebound you got season all right come on go get back yeah it's like yeah it's like it's just it's a challenge though but like you looking forward to it um it's a different vibe man like like your game day routine feels different you got a little extra bounce in your shots you know jittery when you drive it home from shoot around getting ready for the game and they eat before the game no telling everybody house you don't be quiet just be quiet let me think yeah so but it's not like when the game starts it's like you itching for the game starting games there you like cool that's when you're at peace this was funny like you're at peace during the game your closeout game for your first championship mm-hmm what was going through your mind that day that morning you wake up I know you're just talking about like the nerves of that thing but it's it's one thing round one it's one thing mmm in the finals you know two three or whatever but which all my clothes out game now closeout game this is the your opportunity to fulfill that that golden dream what was you're going through your mind that morning you woke up man it was like a dragonfly not dragonfly a big attractive like Jones but uh smooth was show enough The Last Dragon oh yeah that glow yes hello man we were shoot around Steve was like we got a chance to some special but don't put too much pressure on our if we don't win we still going back home we closed it out my home so we don't have to put we should play free and I was like nope listen man I'm not playing no more basketball games after tonight exactly what I said I'm like listen we playing no more after tonight all right like we're gonna win this thing like you know how crazy it is to get here like we may never come back man we've a win tonight and I don't know I just had this glow I'm like I just couldn't wait for the game I like I like felt great like I don't know if I ever felt like that confident that good ever I don't know why I just timing was perfect go straight on to ya Joe is crazy I'm like listen man we going home oh my god I can't imagine right I want to add to that so now that night you heard your name is Most Valuable Player what did that initial when you hear your first name did you even hear your last after day well it's funny because Bob Meyers came at at me and like he was so happy the funny thing is right I was like you laugh I like all the people you hug like when you win like you don't even believe you I can't believe we won I'm like oh man was just wanna like I'm like oh just the holiday came and I grabbed me and I man we just wanna man is crazy like right now look at like why did I do that but I'm like I was like yo this is this is crazy this is crazy and then you just hug people you wouldn't realize you hug like I heard a hug he keep your hand away no no no by like Kiki you not you know Rocco my man just crazy been like Bob Meyers is like yo man like you deserved everything my thanks man like no we just want like I'm happy for him he like no man like you know you got Finals MVP okay huh he was like yo man just crazy right way I was like what I was nothing I was like and then I had my son next to me and he was just happy out of - I was like yeah he was yeah I was there for that I got to see you know it was great did you expect it at all that you were gonna get MVP um no not really you've been through before where it's like it's like DeRose going through it now right you go through those stretches where it's like man you just locked in his own den everything is flowing perfectly and then you go through the opposite to is like many none working so during that part it was like everything just fell like it was flowing it was like the seamless like man just you felt like you just couldn't miss a beat and Bogut was saying it the whole time he was like bro whatever you're doing just keep doing it man like I didn't realize what he was saying but he was like bro you if you keep playing like this this is all you he kept saying like every game and I was like I was like all right it's just everything was just flowing man I it's hard to explain like I don't know in the zone yeah you just you just get locked in so what do you do with all those rings that you have I did I got away are they snotty like locked away sorry I don't want to give out your secrets ain't locked away like somebody can come in and stealing right now make a try there you gonna give you but this is like way it's like sitting on the show like it's in like a box or something like not even know cuz I'm like I'm kind of weird my wife was like why don't you tell me I don't know I guess it's just don't I don't know all right yeah we saw or I don't know if you guys saw but the trainers Chelsea and Deuce and most Mike got their rings when we were just up there and they were so cool to see like how they open the box and it's around all that that was the first one yeah yeah that's the only awesome that's the worst part about have multiple rings it's like each one after that they see me like I did like next day you're like okay I can we get another one speaking of rings we are now joined by Steph Curry we are very happy to have you we're in Atlanta you just got off some appearance or something but you're here right I'm signing autographs I signed some two but they're 100 support what is it Steiner Steiner Sports yeah I'm okay plenty of under armour later too yes God she knows trust me a year with Bayes it's like you'd mention Nike Alps in you here under this what size shoe you wear 16 I'll be the same size yeah over 16 1/2 in the game yeah your Nikes seen you some golf shoes not anymore they still see me stuff so Maggie you're the greatest I think we figure out how to get them I got you cool I went through Kevin Durant they could make it happen good that's good connection yeah go through somebody to go to somebody I know I'm supposed to worry about us I'm supposed to wear it again I got a pair for you took you what yeah four years later to make that happen I'm in a day of having bacon for four years so how to tell a little smile like comment man only I want you to live well stuff thank you so much for coming we're very pleased to have you I want to know I know that you and Vince go way back I see more oh you soon you've seen a little bit so when he played with your dad yeah okay how old were you when you first met Vince 1099 a picture together Nina that we forget I'm sure that definitely is one floating around right from the Toronto Star yeah for sure 1999 so tell us about when you guys met and what you used to do after shoot around and stuff like that well he used to be a practice all the time you know II shot a nose kid or I don't know your brother everybody just on the sidelines waiting every time shooting I mean I understand learning the game you know you sometimes like you don't need Exynos it's just constantly seeing the game which you know you gain now it's just from repetition and just doing all the time it were being around it all the time and it was one of those things where I had to go work out after the game I mean before the game and he was like you ready to go I remember all the time ready it was like our routine it's like I go work out and he's on the sidelines getting ready perfect for I'm like see you is 10 yeah this is one of those things where like for someone I mean our kids this kids would love basketball but it's another thing of who love it and you understanding and your gear around and you become engulfed in it and obviously he's been engulfed in it for both of both of you and your brother for it for it for many years so it was destined to happen then the opportunity and you know he's taking advantage of it and so while I was used to watch shoot around regular practices I was actually just in Toronto like three days ago same practice gym over the time thing so I used to tell him I shoot arounds in the morning on game day I watch me shoot after I might play one-on-one for like ten minutes go back that night for the game me and my brother would go up to the practice facility for the first quarter we just shoot music playing we shoot second quarter right across the concourse is like this little PlayStation console we go play that for a quarter halftime the third quarter we go back and get more shots up and in the fourth quarter we sit and watch cuz we knew you might do something crazy I sit there watch the fourth quarter from the little top section to come down to the seats and watch but it was a cool me obviously a blessed child to be around greatness and around the highest level of basketball but it just hammered out how much I loved the game and my brother as well and just we've always wanted to have a ball on our hands doing something that's what I saw LaBeouf you know just you just like laying in the bed as a kid or in the mall just air-driven I mean that's love that's love you're always thinking about the game itself you know that's what it's all about I think everybody's kind of gone through that moment you say yeah I'm used to doing my oyster inning down spin move that's crazy I'll be looking at my something man what are you doing outside man what you doing man how'd you know now you just say how often did you guys play one-on-one okay yeah he would never lucky was I was what 10 11 so I was probably don't you know how tall you are at that age and I was undersized anyway scrawny little kid but uh that's what thing it was just like you know you start off like oh man I can't get a shot off to where you know I'm gonna figure out how to do it so it's just kind of like yeah persevere you know it's like okay you block my shot every game you know so this is like now pump fake whatever I gotta travel to get it off it's just building those habits and understanding how to succeed in winning on the highest level you know and then that's kind of like the highest level for him at that time mm-hmm you become second nature I even got I talking to Lenny Wilkens is the last two years I think $2,000 to get the all-time coaches winning record into down nuts and took over but like he would actually show me some like write down plays on a whiteboard and stuff and I talked about game playing against whoever y'all coming like Allen Iverson was coming in and talk about like defensive adjustments though I don't know if he was really care about walk walking me through it if he was practicing like he brought my horizon my knowledge of the game of snows crazy so you grew up in the game but when you would play against Vince was he just kind of like one of your dad's friends when your dad's teammates or was he like Curtis Guzman sanity he was the whole the whole day I said the appreciation who it was how we met through my you know him being my dad's teammate was how it started but in terms of like I said with fourth quarters we go down because I knew something crazy about the heaven like I remember one game it's like maybe 10 15 seconds left he was on the obviously wing across the bench home bench he was holding a ball in his left hand holding it back here like this nice on the wing Houston a game I was like we're just sitting there watching I what's he about to do hold it like this is it sighs enough seeing what's gonna happen what baseline and dump the level or somebody talking like that that was when you know Vince and he was alive and I mean I want to wear his shoes and gain my own middle school games and stuff like that and everybody at school I went to school in Toronto and everybody's talking about him and how much he grew the game of basketball north of the border but obviously a different NBA it was definitely an awareness so it was going on for sure so could you have could you have gotten any pair of shoes you want and growing up with that reason they they only did so my dad he jumped around a couple different brands even you know brand off via back in the huh you had too many of these in the in the class ever since but in terms of like it some of the teammates he had I get some kicks not most of them either to get a game warrant stuff I couldn't get stuff in my side got you but I did have my my godmother blessed me with some custom shots that was my high school colors after I left that's my dad retired so those are my joints back in the day which comes full circle because we're into high school my daughter goes there now so all the Christian so they're now ballin volleyball so is pretty crazy Steph no did I go to yes you bet pretty cool outside of that I think the first time playing against them is kind of like you know I was at that point I was kind of going through that and I'm playing against my teammates you know sudden it's like knowing him and I was playing one-on-one now to actually for it to actually count and his reals like he's not real big Glenn Robinson yeah the first time I saw him your son your daddy was my teammate it's great it's a lot of guys man mm-hmm was a pretty cool moment like affirmed for me to kind of you know testament like I was just I think at that moment I was thankful to still be able to compete at this level to still be around to even play against a lot of these guys but particularly him because of the history many many years ago when I was doing my thing that's how weird was that it was weird I was just right that's what I thought the first time I saw I was like man I gotta file you some I know something you know this is just cool so when we lost her in the playoffs in Memphis mm-hmm you know everybody talks about all you know no it wasn't more so just more so like sportsmanship is more so proud of you know his accomplishments and obviously it was a we didn't do we couldn't beat these boys but it's a problem now a moment have to gain fully and we have to gain yeah but it's like you know just a proud moment like you know just thankful for the opportunity to still play this game against you know you know young guy who was 10 years old and now on his way to accomplishing something that you know obviously every player wants to accomplish so a great moment for me that's pretty crazy yeah is let's transition to phase moring and how you first met stuff tell us they know me shoot I was you know I draft the guy on the ESPN ranked he was no one and then there was joking I was like it's a bunch of dead guys on there oh yeah what you know and then you know Under Armour had you know send me a ton of stuff so I got an apartment I got this little two-bedroom apartment got a matches the laptop ethernet cord like a 30-foot ethernet cord ran across the floor and like 19 bucks from mine arm so every day I opened up like you know these plastic bags new stuff every day bucket hats you know big baggy stuff you know that stuff went out stuff it's now it's like kind of slim now but big baggy stuff and not wear it every day you know just walking around like I belong and uh you know it's just kind of cool to you know actually be in the NBA you know not getting drafted and you know watching the entire draft and not seeing your name go you see guys it's plating in psychology you know what's going on you know and you know some believe about training camp and you know just getting to watch these guys play night you know it was like a dream come true so my old to the game of basketball was just you know you know celebrate you know just you know being happy and I could've selling a bench and pouted but you know these guys are you know you see the work they put in you know after practice Dharma practice and for them to go out and you know do some of this amazing stuff cuz I played basketball in the mid major conference and you know go from there to the not been in HD double-a tournament would go to the NBA and see like the level of difficulty the shots that no stuff will make and all these guys I'm Harrison Barnes don't know no package oh my god I got like mm-hmm yummy it was you know seeing stuff like that you know it's hard to sit over there and just kind of you know chill and you know the Bay Area does a good job of you know blowing stuff up for you knowing they caught a couple no photos of me doing this stuff every time you made a dream and he just kind of blew up and you know you know been an image of God obviously saw stuff it you know Davidson you know no magazines and stuff and you know he came out and you know undersized guy you know back against the wall chip on his shoulder and you know he just paid away for a lot a lot of guys like myself and all those members of guys that you know they say dude I'm playing against a lot of competition but you know giving a chance he blow the doors off and you know it's kind of cool too for our relationship the girl from now to like seven years later you know to see what he's done for Under Armour and being blessed to have a hand in that you know a shot in the dark really you know just the crazy love dart absolutely did you convince stuff to sign with Under Armour I just you know I painted a picture I saw Hardy work you know all I just painted like I mean I was like look man yeah at the time we had like Kemba Walker Brandon Jennings you know will Barton you know yeah DeAndre Jordan you know his shoe was a freaking poop no you know they have anyone to move the needle and he's just what happened that his contracts coming up and you know he had a long you know history with Nike you know I found all this stuff out where I was like man look look at your own shoe you know you will have all this stuff ain't oh I haven't talked to anyone I know I'm about this none of this I'm just shooting in the dark and you know sure enough Chris stone shouts Tony got in touch and you know the rest is history now he run in the game yeah this him is it's been cool to watch man and you know playing his kicks all the time and you know it's a rule you know with with old teammates you know some guys don't play and another guy shoes when they play this but I mean stuffs comfortable man what do you think about Bey's when you first met him and saw his antics he's just a team player man like interns like he talked about his journey to the NBA not taking any day for granted like I sound cliche but like literally his perspective every day was how can I have fun and enjoy this and lift up the people around me even if I'm on the court or not and so that's where the the seed was planted in terms of like what you saw on a bench and that was true like genuine excitement it wasn't like I'm here to just hype up the crowd right get make a video or have something go viral it was it took a life of its own because that's how he approached every day so well there was somebody hitting the side of a backboard or if it was him doing the bazemore with the three celebration or whatever like that's always fun you look oh you do some you know good on the court your team's playing well everybody's excited feeling like they have a little piece to the puzzle in terms of having a successful team especially what we started from in terms of the chaos around our organization from when I was drafted two three years later when my baby shot up and kind of where we went from there so he obviously is a vet now he's a vet on his team he's leading the younger guy as he lets carve out a lane for him in the NBA right now and it's been amazing to watch kind of where he started from and just the way he approached every day and it's obviously well-deserved but again it's a testament to God just appreciating being an NBA and understanding and he's being patient he was working but it you know he's down there on the sidelines sitting and he's gonna enjoy yourself and celebrating and left his teammates I think that's a lesson learned I mean just to hear that and understand like there's a lot of guys who are knocking at the door trying to get it get that opportunity and get that call up or get an opportunity just to get a workout and you know I think sometimes young guys rookies or undrafted guys once they finally say oh yes I put that Jersey I'm here now that's that they don't understand yeah that's that's just the beginning it's part of stay stand I'm saying understanding your role and being patient you know and putting the work in so sometimes like we don't understand basketball we put in for five hours a day maybe let's just say that's what football puts in a whole day right we complain San Jose shoot after is come on like is this it's the things that you have to do is the groundwork that you have to put in to become what they've always wanted to become we're all said we want to be superstars we wanted we had dreams and shoot and like I said shooting and you bid like I won't be a star I'm gonna hit the game-winning shot well you can't hit gang when the shots you can't become stars it's gonna put the work in mm-hmm young saying so like that's just great to hear you know somebody who's come from there because we always look at the stories of everybody who did a year two three in college get drafted number one number two like okay what about those ones like the Darrell Armstrong in the world who you know people don't understand that and they feel like you can no you can still make it go on a different path and that's just great to hear that's why I loved hearing Jeremy Lin's story last week I feel like it's pretty similar to yours like I didn't know he even went through all that trouble and got cut in the middle of training camp practice yeah and he had just scored on me in a one-on-one an attorney can practice and like play the government's like I'm a Jay Leno they want to see us I would have mentioned we play you play the Clippers worries Clippers is a huge rivalry like we couldn't stand each other and Blake Griffin you know Chris Paul drives no late clock Blake Griffin in the left corner right in front of my bench across from my bench shoots a shot I'm like right on my off the backboard the ball disappears this is side of the backboard and I just kind of like freaked out yes yes yeah my gets it on tape so I guess he was kind of by the way yeah he's in Detroit now he's playing with Detroit mhm they got a good was quality you guys just came from there right how are you feeling stuff you know you're back in it I feel good happy to be back three weeks my pops called me uh in the thirty club now no I hurt my groin he taught me so look at you getting them dirty old injuries I just got her getting a massage Wow that's where I got massaged with my foot so this is my foot like this oh I got my side my foot was going this way trying to get my Achilles and it was smashing the tendon and fired No so I didn't want to say how it happened I was like what happened I was like our knowledge is in weird position because that masseuse is been there from the beginning and it's like she's not the one assist I wasn't great so it was one of the ones that's most lawyer to grace so she's cool so I want to say she did it so I was like man I was just in a weird position man it's one of these things you pop it out go away my yo is this I'm really wrong my foot she was like she needs to be fired I'm like oh man it went away - I'm 29 I'm 30 in July no you you do more to take care of your body than prey yeah I do he has a backpack and a strap back with a suitcase up my last his last summer maybe summer for last summer when we went to a wedding and uh in Rhode Island and so like I get so we said y'all got the little air B&B Joyce we're all saying the same spot and this dude had literally ten pieces of like equipment force all tissue massage what is this what is this I amaz on everything by the time I left right then we go play golf the next morning and like in the back of his golf cart was it their gun yeah get yourself right now coach he was a freaking lieutenant two miles you know we had a six-week program where we did two miles every Monday for time Wednesday we do like some stuff on a football field like Sprint's and then Friday we had this thing called 20 and 20 well you did 26 hours and 20 minutes like is yeah it was nuts though five years straight no this is quick I never asked you from your perspective from Ricky here's 98 now yeah from then so now like how different is that part of our world in terms of like the treatment treatment like the whole we only had probably two or three people as far as training staff is like trainer maybe a massage therapist and two other helpers that's it and then you had this cold tub ice tub and stem still standing straight all just I said I was in older son I used to watch Doug Christie go literally sit in the tub to his neck like what now you get in the car the cryo yeah I mean he used to sit in the tub there's more ice in his life it's crazy this is totally different now I mean just I mean cold tub is nothing now before just like add some ice ain't that what we've had the metal tubs we still got yes like a loaf great yeah I feel like those things were extra cold like as far as the tubs because no this metal continued ice water come on bro this important especially way I play manly down I just say that about D way all the falling he was like why you fall down seven times you know what I said as a black man you gotta get up Jeremy was like so how do you fall down seven get a beta - movie question no somebody said you know those memes where somebody smoking somebody said wait how do you know it sounded dinosaurs made these movies said Dave how do they know what swords me so my gonna actually like transcribed with the sound sound leg and they just wanna kill you go walk yeah somewhere like okay so we don't know I don't tell you where the sound is right where we ever been to the moon no they don't get us you don't think so we got some we took something to the moon I don't think so I had a bag phone no way with the laughs on the bag the table I like not a night the russ berrie for tight phone but not like oh you put in the center console Mike had one of those could you take it out of the car yeah you tell me but you so that was like you realize right the cigarette lighter yeah that's how you got around did you have one of those no I had a cell phone like my senior high school I've got a cell phone it was like a regular like Motorola joint yes like a Nokia yeah yeah you could get the worm with only games but the beat sorry it's the list by this big anybody he's like oh you two ways I never could get one of them I ain't you know check some Arizona I want one of them so bad I wanted to way so bad with Arkansas I saw online that you almost went dark but Arkansas Kansas no I was like that was one of my funny all right they are that was my favorite visit Arkansas Arkansas was my favorite because obviously when I was on campus at Kansas and we went to a football game who's a bunch of old people I'm watching they terribly on a bad but in coastal but I don't know I'm thinking how many chicks you know Chamberlin one threw out all these women and I don't know why I thought about that I apologize old women I'm like what's handling we're here city hit 20,000 women $25,000 no way yeah somebody book somebody really done the plausibility of that statement based on like it was like three date oh I'm like there's no way you can see is it possible days nah good as if he ran against the weight on post moves he was making he coulda got oh he could have done it that man did a post move like this to my best center of all time man I do want to ask you because there's been so many comparisons of Trey on to you I just want and you can give us a real answer about what you think about him so far in the comparisons and then we can wrap and then you guys can play golf he should cut his hair before that so I'm gonna watch on yeah like whatever they wear watches they wear with a little money like him a lot I like that I like that oh he got all the deals now did he get it oh damn William cuz it'll be they be tight Dan Williams it yeah oh that's Carlos Boozer they had they were playing ball throw is know who was in the game we run the plate and Reggie Evans he craves my smells like yo-yo something right the third quarter it was like halfway goes that you went from like pitch dark to light especially why your face when he talked like he did it oh man he did it epic fail yeah there oh the comparisons are what they are I can't avoid them at this point how much scrutiny and visible he's been in the last two years my thing is yeah there's some similarities so like when I came in and read her talking about me and Steve Nash and like yeah that was my gonna like basketball idol in the court in terms that I wanted to play like him I went to combine him and Reggie Miller into the same person and that's like the player that I wanted to be he did but in terms of like wow I didn't put pressure on myself to be Steve Nash my rookie year my second year was all about like playing a game that I don't know how to play how I feel for Trey in this situation no I haven't talked to him specifically about it but like if people put a spotlight that had had on him right now that they put on they did that to me when I was 19 20 21 nobody who ever with talked about me the way you talk about me now because I wasn't ready and there's a process to everything so it's great that they're comparing him to us because that's kind of there's potential there and there's been the reason that they're spending breath on him is because he's done some some amazing things but just be patient and so I said oh thanks fairly young guys like I don't like you when they put who do you compare such assets to I'm like well a player shows flashes of yes I'm waiting and they're gonna be they're gonna you know create their own you know Lane if you would I mean yeah you're gonna seek I mean there's been so many superstars and guys who changed the game so now as they change the game you're gonna see guys try to incorporate some of the tools or the things that they have in their game was now you're gonna start seeing flashes up I remember coming out of Carolina obviously that was tomorrow or the next Michael Jordan no no no no I don't want to be there yeah you may see flashes of that because if we go home we trying to know be like Mike but like I'm not trying to be Mike you know I'm saying so like I'm Tiger Woods like I'm gonna you know you might see some things or see some afraid away like them but now I'm trying to create my own lanes nobody wants that pressure yeah and I think they want try to look like you now and his first year into the link and I think that's not a fair society use yeah that and I say that I say to young guys and people who are in his corner if you if you're gonna try to compare him or try to build you know the the next Steph Curry thing well then start from the beginning yeah yeah and build it like then there's no I haven't man he's gonna be fun that he's gonna I truly I would I put money behind him in terms of like the promise that he has and being able to lead a team um you know as his career unfolds but in terms of the year the process has to happen like you are my rookie year all I was worried about was just getting better there was no pressure for me to win right away there's no but there was no amusing kind of similar situation it's play bass yeah just go out you know make guys better to figure out learn the game you know learn the lifestyle learn how to become a pro okay you know you just turned 20 so you got a lot to learn anyways about 20 first year I was picking my major it's on you Vince was drafted before Trey was born yes or no I'm three months older than his damn good he was in the league before Trey was born yeah that's what's crazy that's remember and now they're on the same team you have outlasted everyone Vince Carter yes he's holding on exactly no I definitely say that I said you know take your time and just write no start no don't skip steps is what I would I'm basically saying for to all the young people who are listening to this I don't care who your favorite player is and don't skip steps you know if you want to be that go look at go do your homework that's right what amount of freaking homework I don't know how it started like how they struggled learn how they struggled first we come in like always gonna be like such a success you looking at the polished product right look at the beginning where it's all rusting nobody wanted it'll Chauncey the Chauncey Billups that's something like that's look at that I mean talk about do you know Steve Nash in terms of like where he's he was an understudy for three years before he actually got a shot and I switch teams we figure out how to get you know how to Jason Kidd shadow no deal and then he learned though then he was thrown in out there figured it out rest was history but out into trade advice for Trey obviously just be himself in the whole equation like he is different he's the only one that missed ray on that plays the way he plays a game like you said there are flashes or similarities comparisons whatever but as he unfolds I understand how he's gonna be successful in this league and everybody's situation is different and sometimes like what they need to do to help a team win as opposed to getting you know most potential out of themselves so you manage to be patient Zarah your favorite players struggle first and send me out letting go from like that oh yeah one of my favorite quotes in regards to patients is it takes ten years to become overnight success and that's like some always thereby that's why I like you know just saying just take it a day at a time you know especially with my golf game now that the crew the gang's all here who is the best golfer at this table like what you guys hit the chorus you met in the basement right now what's his number now seven oh my goodness yeah spit with your stuff you like a plus two not so Steph is the best course I can't sing for nothing are you a fast I can snow no not fast when I can swim though yeah no you know clay no you sure you play with champion Serena wins I'll see a ping pong she's actually I was gonna say I better touch something as though a bit or was it a it was a foreign dude that one it was uh you know those alright well this wasn't last year before this this is a sink a speedballing - well yeah well I thought it was you as a Bogut it wasn't never he's seven foot like he's breaking the ping-pong strategy ping-pong is a fun sport last year was my first time playing ever in Toronto yeah yeah we had a little boy I lost I lost like first round I was like I'm about to get good at one man I think uh josh magette he'd be Dennis Dennis is pretty good too and all serious know for y'all's golf games when you start playing since our plan Hill 20 years ago but like flats five years yeah but like I've been playing since I was 10 right and like it is just really really really really strong advantage when you get kid and just get the fundamentals I stuff like I don't understand how you can start from where y'all started and like to where y'all got now unreal but obviously you live in you golf junkies but it's just crazy terms like it's so hard to get good at golf if you starting from scratch is so hard because every step is a big jump right so and then all of a sudden you just get to a halt that's what that's what I'm afraid of how about Cameron champ though bro I told his only weakness is that he's a Nike guy yeah I started up close in person for two rounds and he was in my I played with him in a Martin trainer at the web.com Tour yeah yeah that is a different sound different ball fight I've ever seen in my entire life somebody told me on a couple guys in web and one guy on a PGA Tour said if you advanced analytics of golf but if you took like everybody all the long hitters on tour on PGA Tour and say who gets the most value out of their driver talking distance accuracy whatever like they said Cameron gets the most value out of it I saw that on his uh easy to know his fairway accuracy it was like unbelievable if somebody hits so far it's unreal a hot day he actually is in the fairway as much as years right Oh amazed aren't real it makes it look so easy like okay I just need to know I can get myself in that position there has is just let me talk about a time like his hips facing the target miss saris mine I got my time I ate one but I'm not 81 not today but I ain't playing so mm-hm if I played it with my handicap screwing me up right now my turn right now mm-hmm Tahoe by the way phenomenal I'm Charlie I told you yeah okay I'm there to summer that first thank players we need already talked about it let me hear ya I'm around when is it July White said well last year yes 16th we had a nice little you know we had a nice car Larry reality there Williams said Jay kid didn't come this year he'll Charles Barkley see what was there oh yeah he did open he wouldn't last a stay was like oh I

right birdie see your point rest of all time go home with Phil was never just all over the place man dude oh I'd watch it again though I Tatum is that right then horses playing so tough though like the pains around my tough spice very tough spots how would they do that though I don't know I wish I had a set up so they can reshoot by 65 now it has something to shoot at 69 man let's get to hard let's pick up the night footers let's keep it moving sorry missus oh man it's arguments that 3-footer on my number two son to feel mister when I'm a war I'm like I said they bring them to back next year have the same and I written the match rematch and then have like two younger guys like Patrick Reed and jordan Spieth or Patrick and Jordan have more action saying covering Brooks versus DJ cause

Channel 4 News weather forecast, with Liam Dutton: http://www.channel4.com/weather/

All the latest blog posts from the Channel 4 News on-screen talent: http://blogs.channel4.com/news/",China moon landing -- the science and the politics,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wvtlx_rS_OM,0,10454,46,6,10,Wvtlx_rS_OM,could future historians look back at this weekend and decide the two completely unrelated events symbolized a significant even profound shift on earth Nelson Mandela a man who embody the 20th century struggle for democracy will soon be laid to rest more on that in a minute on the moon the new superpower China has landed its own unmanned spacecraft the Changi three rocket and it's Jade rabid robot will carry out scientific experiments loaded with political matter another notch in China's ascendancy we asked the science broadcaster and close observer of China's space program Sara Curtis to watch events it landed on the moon the dawn of a new era in space exploration today China became only the third nation to land on the moon and the first for nearly 40 years the Jade rabbit Rover will operate on the lunar surface for at least three months exploring a three square kilometre area it will dig and analyze soil samples and has a ground-penetrating radar that will be able to analyze the moon's surface to a depth of 90 feet but it's not just a scientific project it's a political statement not too long ago the moon was practically America's backyard a source of national pride and an essential part of the image of a superpower at the time most Chinese would have barely been aware the space race was happening let alone expected their country to take part that has now changed China's would thrust is taking it to new territories and is showcasing its scientific power to the world and this in a way joining the seal power Club in terms would be able to send her over to the moon is that more of a political statement than a scientific one I think size part is less so than political the aim is a manned landing which China wants to see inside a decade relics of America's space dominance are now found in museums like the lunar lander model here at the Science Museum NASA no longer launches its own astronauts and its budget is at its lowest since 2007 John Czarnecki is a visiting professor at Bay Han University in Beijing I don't subscribe to the idea that the Americans are finished in space NASA still has a large budget and it does great things they are perhaps not so obvious because they focus more on unmanned mission robotic missions it's 41 years ago this week since Americans last walked on the moon although the Chinese landing of an unmanned rover isn't considered a game-changer it is significant because it marks another shift in power towards the east and takes the Chinese that one step closer to landing a human on the moon China's success is good news for another of the world's leading space industries ours the components here at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Oxford are so delicate that one of the biggest dangers is human contamination an instrument flowing in 2018 on a NASA spacecraft called the James Webb Space Telescope and that's the replacement for Hubble the space industry in the UK is worth 10 billion a year and is growing at 10 percent most of our programs currently and in the past have been with NASA and the European Space Agency the fact that the Chinese are opening up this new market really helps us enormously it gives us big opportunities to work within in a sense it's a no brainer for both countries to work the future is likely to see the two countries working closest together but for the moment this mission is all Chinese and even though the Jade rabbit's contribution to science won't be fast its boost to China's ego would be much larger and take the country one step closer to their ultimate goal

this is the Apollo 11 press conference the format today will consist of a 45 minute presentation by the Apollo 11 crew followed by question and answers at this time I'd like to introduce the Apollo 11 crew astronauts Neil Armstrong Michael Collins Edwin Alden Deal it was our pleasure to have participated in one great adventure it's an adventure that took place not just in the month of July but rather one that took place in the last decade we all here and the people listening in today had the opportunity to share that adventure over its developing and unfolding in the past months and years it's our privilege today to share with you some of the details of that final month of July that was certainly the highlight for the three of us of that decade we're going to divert a little bit from the format of past press conferences and talk about the things that interested us most in particularly the things that occurred on and about the moon we will use a number of films and slides which most of you have already seen and with the intent of pointing out some of the things that we observed on the spot which may not be obvious to to those of you who are who are looking at them here from the surface of Earth the slightest you know started promptly and I think that was characteristic of of all the events of the flight the Saturn gave us one magnificent ride both into Earth orbit and on a trajectory to the moon our our memory of that actually differs little from the reports that you have all heard from from those previous Saturn 5 flights and and those the previous flights served as well in preparation for this fight in the boost as well as that the subsequent phases problem we would like to skip directly to the translator Coast phase and undockings are a transposition and docking sequence this was our first look at the Magnificent machinery which had been behind this up until this point the booster of course the first and second stages have long since separated but this shows the limb nestled inside the third stage yes Corby after the translunar inject this manoeuvre was an interesting combination of manual and automated techniques and that we programmed the on-board computer to make the turnaround and then these final maneuvers were made completely manually as I approach the LEM I had an easy time because I had a docking target which is not clearly visible here which allowed me to align the probe and the drogue which is a dark spot you see on upper right during this time I also checked out the proper vehicle response to my stick inputs and here shortly you'll see the actual docking somewhat speeded up there's a point of contact and in just a second you'll see a second right there a second small indication of the retract cycle when the twelve duck for the lunar module of courses in a sense upside down relative to the command module this is in lunar orbit showing the separation of the lunar module from the command module is as viewed through my window this was a busy time for me and that I was taking these motion pictures through the right-hand window at the same time I was taking still photos through the left-hand window and also flying my vehicle and probably poorly and taking a close look at the lemons as he turned around my most important job here was to make sure that all his landing gear were down and properly locked prior to his dick you a better idea of the detail available with the 70 millimeter of course this is a still and shows the LEM he the right side up or upside down I'm not sure which it looks more like to me it look like a praying mantis and it does the first-class flying machine in this view but it was a beautiful piece of machinery the the landing gear are at the top and you can see the probes which indicate lunar contact is spin wires extending upward from Elena here of course before we could undock as is shown in this picture we had to complete the activation now the day before we undock we entered the LEM and went through an entire switch configuration tech and we exercised the various communication modes in retrospect since we did have a little bit of communication problems on the following day during powered descent we would recommend that we might take a more thorough check of this on the day before descent on the day that we did finally entered a LEM for the landing maneuver we went through a staggered sequence of shooting and we found it with all the simulations that we had run back here in Houston or with Houston tied with our simulations in the Cape that we were quite confident that we would be able to complete this lemma activation in the given time period which was approximately four hours we managed to get thirty minutes ahead of the time and it allowed us to get a more accurate platform alignment jacket wine after the undocking maneuver we went through a brief radar check and then the command module executed a 2 foot per second maneuver away from us so that we would both be able to independently exercise our guidance system through a star alignment checker which we did following this this separation maneuver now this occurred in the vicinity close to the landing site and you can see at this point the command module is traveling right over the center of our targeted point is approaching now what we called a cat's paw following this separation maneuver on the backside of the moon we made a decent orbit insertion which is a slightly over 70 foot per second maneuver that lowers our altitude down to 50,000 feet we had two guidance systems working for us they behaved perfectly both of them agreed extremely closely as to the results of this maneuver following this we use the radar to confirm the actual departure rate from the command module this is a view of the descent trajectory area is viewed through the lam Linda during our activation in the bottom right of the photograph is the crater masculine and the bottom center is the final phases of the descent the landing area itself is in is in the smooth area at the top of the picture just before we arrived at the shadow on what's called the Terminator we had seen a number of pictures from Apollo's 8 & 10 which gave us an excellent understanding of the ground track over which we would pass during the descent we're now looking up the right hand window of the crater and there is masculine w it occurred approximately approximately two to three seconds late and leave us degraded our ability to determine not only our altitude and altitude rate in the final phases but also and probably more importantly our translational velocities or over the ground it's quite important not to stub your toe during the final phases of touchdown and once once settled on the surface the the dust cleared immediately and we had an excellent and of course the surface was very fine-grained we could tell that from from our view out the window but there were a surprisingly large number of rocks of all sizes this is the view out the right window up close to the horizon is the boulder field that was probably deposited by some of the impacts and the craters that were behind us we see most of the craters have rounded edges however there is a variation in the the age of these as we can tell by the sharpness of the edge of the crater the immediate foreground area we'll see more pictures of later it was relatively flat terrain in contrast to looking forward along where the shadow of the LEM has cast on the surface and we see a zero phase glow around the upper portion of the LEM the general color of the terrain looking down son with a very light tannish color this blended as we look more cross son to a more sharper well-defined features and more of a gray color during the initial time period after touchdown we went through various sequences to prepare us for immediate abort or liftoff if we found that that was necessary we had finally get to vent the fuel and oxidiser manifolds a good bit earlier and we had thought we went through these various checks and prepared for one liftoff that would occur about 21 minutes after the beginning of powered descent the ground gave us a stay during this period we did not have to make use of that they then proceeded at that point into our simulated countdown which consisted of checking our guidance systems we made use of a gravity align feature where the inertial platform of the primary guidance would reviews the gravity vector to determine the local vertical we would then compare this with the alignments that we had previously we also made use of the Stars through the telescope and aligning a crosshair by rotating the field of view until the crosshair superimposed on the star this would give us the angular measurement of the star within the field of view of the telescope we then determine the distance out by aligning another radical spiral on this we went through an averaging technique on board and then fed this information into the computer and this came up with our various alignment checks we this was all in preparation for a possible liftoff that would occur about two hours after touchdown as Mike in Columbia came over for the first revolution the ground network gave us a stay and we continued briefly through the remainder of this checklist and our simulated countdown and at this point we terminated and powered down many systems onboard the spacecraft and went into an eatery a number of other experts had prior to the flight predicted that a good bit of difficulty might be encountered by people attempting to work on the system proved to be the case and after landing we felt very comfortable in the lunar gravity it it was in fact in in our view separable both to weightlessness and the Earth's gravity this led us to believe this in conjunction with the fact that all the systems in the limb work were operating magnificently and we had very few problems to go ahead with the what the surface work immediately we predicted that we might be ready to leave the land by 8 o'clock but those of you who followed on the ground recognized we missed our estimate by the deal this was due to a number of factors one we had housecleaning to perform food packages flight plans and all the items that we'd used in the previous descent to be stowed out of the way and prior to depressurizing the lunar module i took longer to depressurize the lunar module then we had anticipated and it also took longer to get the cooling units in our back packs operating and then we had expected and some in substance it took us awesome day an hour longer to get ready than then and we would that then we had predicted when when we actually descended the ladder it found it was found to be very much like the lunar gravity simulations we had performed here on earth and no difficulty was was encountered in and descending the ladder the last step was about three and a half feet from the surface and we're somewhat concerned that we might have difficulty and and re-entering the limb at the end of our activity period so we practiced that practice that before doing the exercise of bringing the camera down which took the subsequent surface pictures here you see the camera being lowered on what might be called a Brooklyn clothesline I was operating quite carefully here because immediately to my right and off the picture was a 6-foot deep crater and I was so much concerned about losing my balance on the steep slopes the other item of interest in the very early stages of the EBA should it should it have been cut short for some unknown reason was the the job of bringing back a sample of the lunar rocks and these photographs show the collection of that initial sample into a small bag and then that bag being deposited in my pocket this was the first of a number of times when we found two men were a great help I quickly put up the TV camera and and then more leisurely but was and I joined together to erect the American flag we found on a number of occasions that we were ill able to help each other in many ways on the surface and you probably recall the times that I got my foot caught in the television cable and buzz was able to help me extract it without without calling down we had some difficulty at first getting the pole of the flag to remain into the surface in penetrating the surface we found that most objects would go down about five maybe six inches and then it would meet with a year gradual resistance at the same time there was not much of a supporting force on either side so we had to lean the flag back slightly in order for it to maintain this position so many people have done so much to give us this opportunity to place this American flag on the surface commedia was one of the proud moments of my life to be able to stand there and quickly salute the flag crisp the rest of the activity seemed to go very rushed there were a lot of things to do and we had hard time getting them finished we did find that mobility on the surface was in general a good bit better than perhaps we had anticipated it there was a slight tendency to to be more nearly toward the rear of a neutral stable position balance seem to be quite easy to identify and as one would lean want a slight bit to one side of the other was very easy to identify when this loss of balance was approaching in maneuvering around as you saw just was one of my tasks fairly early in the EBA I found that a standard loping technique of one foot in front of the other worked out quite well as as we would have expected one could also jump in more of a kangaroo fashion two feet at a time this seemed to work too many interesting things to do the the surface as as we said what was fine grain with lots of rocks in it took footprints very well in the footprints stayed in place the the lamb was in in good shape and exhibited no damage from the landing or the descent it's a picture of the ladder with the well-known plaque on the primary strut he there was a question as to whether Lim would sink in up to its knees it didn't as you can see the footpad sunk in perhaps an inch or two and the probe in this picture was folded over and sticks up through the sand in the bottom right hand corner showing showing that we were indeed traveling slightly sideways it had touched down there were a wide variety of surfaces here buzzes Danny in the small crater and it gives a very good picture of the rounded rims of the Abdeen what we believe are are very old features the two experiments that you saw in a previous picture were deployed in a scientific equipment Bay we found that getting them down produced no significant problems and here you see a view of my carrying these two experiments out to the deployment site about 70 feet to the south of the lunar module you have a very good view of the varying depths of this upper surface layer you see that along the crater rim a small crater rim off to my left along this the the upper surface appears to be about two to three inches and the subsurface has a slope that is rather ill-defined and one has to be very careful in threading your way around these very small craters any long excursions I feel would would take a good bit of attention as you're moving along to avoid walking along or down the slope of some of these smaller craters this is the passive seismic experiment that was deployed and has been giving us good returns on the interactions of the of the moon we had a little difficulty deploying one of the panel's I had to move around to the far side and release a restraining lever and then the second panel came out we had a little bit of difficulty determining as Neil said the exact local horizontal and I think this is due to the decrease in the cues that a person has as to which way up up really is one has to lean a little bit more off to the side before you get this body cue that if you're approaching off balance and of course the the terrain vary considerably in this area this second experiment is the laser reflector we've been successful in bouncing laser beams off this consists of a hundred arrays of corner reflectors the other experiment please or two into the surface we collected three different court tube samples it was quite surprising the resistance that was met in this subsurface medium and at the same time you see that it did not support very well the court tube as I was driving it into the surfer this is a close a double picture it's actually a stereo picture of a fine particulate material in the moon this was taken from a glass and the analysis of the cause for that characteristic is of extreme interest to the scientific community our second picture taken with that the scientific camera shows the nature of the clods of lunar surface material and this picture shows the 80-foot crater which I that you observed earlier in the motion picture footage during the final phases of descent we had very much hope that this this crater would be deep enough to to show the lunar bedrock it it was about 15 or 20 feet deep and although there are rocks in the bottom there are no evidences on the inner walls of actually getting a picture or a view of the lunar bedrock we deposited several items on the lunar surface I'm sure you're aware of these one was a disc with 33 messages from nations of the world it was a patch from Apollo one and various medals from the cosmonaut we also elected as a crew to deposit a symbol which was representative of our patch that is the US Eagle carrying the olive branch for the lunar surface and we thought it was appropriate to deposit this replica of the olive branch before we left this after re-entering of the limb we could see the effects of our in the area where the majority of the walking took place however in the left side of the picture where it is not as dark there was also a good bit of walking and so that indicates that the rocking probably just increases your ability to notice the effects of the strange lighting that was talked about earlier where the cross Sun lighting is a good bit darker than the down bouncing following the EBA we had the we had a sleep raid which in a word didn't go quite as well as we thought it might we found it was quite difficult to to keep warm when we forgot are difficult for us to sleep you see mounted in the right hand window the 16 millimeter camera as it was mounted for taking the pictures on the surface following the safe graders we're approaching the liftoff point we've progressed with a gradual power up of the lunar module which included another star alignment up in front of the instrument panel that was used to record the various messages that were sent up to us the whole host of numbers for the particular manoeuvres that were coming up that we would copy down we logged these on that sort of Vega data sheet this film shows our final look at tranquility base before our departure and the essent was a great pleasure was very smooth we were very very pleased they had that engine light up gave us a excellent view of the part our takeoff projectory and tranquility base as we left and at all times through the essent we could pick up landmarks that assured us that we were on on the proper track were no difficulties with the particular out of plane maneuver that had been inserted between two other sequential maneuvers in comparison with many simulator runs we found that this was about as perfect a rendezvous as liquid of a sport you've noted some oscillations in this film during ascent and that's a real characteristic the vehicle due to the changing center gravity as fuel is used does a good bit of 5 degree oscillations throughout the ascent this is Eagle is seen by Columbia or perhaps half an Eagle would be better since the lenka although it although we were far from home we were a lot closer to it than the pure distance might indicate Neal's making the initial maneuvers here to get turned around and then again I do the final docking this is somewhat swifter than in real time the probe the the dark funnel on the top of the Lamb and the the docking target below it and to the left in the lighter portion of the limb the his bus said the rendezvous was absolutely beautiful they came up from below absolutely exist they were riding on a rail there was absolutely no no disturbance or any economical effects during the last part of hunt ago upper right you can see the the RCS quads and down below the very at this relatively close range it had a decided three-dimensional effect and was undoubtedly one of the most impressive sights of the flight as we as we left the moon after a successful Kei this is the view that we observed I think that at least from where where I said here on a stage the colors that you see there are quite close to being actually representative of the moon as seen from from that distance we were up sorry to see the moon go but we were certainly see I had to see that courage return we used took a large number of photographs order on the way out and back and had our wristwatches set on distant I'm an interesting in the use can be made of that if you were looking at this picture and and you looked at your watching your watch said the seven o'clock in the evening then you'd know that Houston is about seven o'clock from the evening and it's about an hour away from sunset so it would be about one twenty-fourth of an Earth's circumference away from the shadow which is just about fifteen degrees there so at anytime by looking at a wristwatch and looking down at the earth we knew what was underneath the clouds and it aided us in some ways and picking up what what we should be seen if we could see a large number of details on on the Earth's surface certainly all the continents and Islands and details committee of which you followed perhaps and in our discussions over the over the radio communications but it was interesting to us to find out how well we could observe weather patterns on not only the world wide scale which you see here but in the specific localities this particular shot does show that coast of North America the equatorial cloud layers a what we think is probably in Turkey we're ready now for questions and answers and wait for the microphone and we'll go right down the line we'll catch everyone feel just be patient how much time did you have left in your life support backpacks at the time you got back on board Lam I haven't seen the post-flight analysis of the numbers we had rough up roughly half of our available oxygen supply remaining in the backpacks and somewhat less percentage in the water supplies which is used for cooling of course particularly on our first experience with the use of that backpack on the lunar surface we were interesting interested in conserving a good bit of margin in case we had difficulty with closing the hatch or refresher izing the lam or had any difficulties with getting the systems operating again in the normal fish and inside the cockpit Colonel Aldrin and mr. Armstrong when President Nixon made his phone call see one alone it looked like you the two of you suddenly stopped doing it doing everything and stood there and listened we talked to him it looked there for a moment like you might have been a little bit aware of what was going on weren't busy was there ever a moment on the moon when either one of you were just a little bit spellbound by what was going on by 30 hours I'd like to ask Neil Armstrong when he begin to think of what he would say when he put his foot down on the lunar surface and how long he pondered this is the statement about a small step for man gigantic leap for me yes I did think about it it it was not extemporaneous neither was it planned and evolved during the conduct of the flight and I decided what the words would be while we're on the loner lunar surface just prior to leaving away like ask Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin and I'm not quite sure how to ask this question but when you first stepped on the moon did it strike you as you were stepping that you were stepping on a piece of the earth or sort of what your inner feelings were whether you felt you were standing in a desert or this was really another world or how you felt at that point well there was no question in our minds where we were we've been orbiting around the at the same time we have experienced one six G before we've been exposed to some degree for the lighting that we saw however this was in my case an extremely foreign situation with the stark nature of the light and dark conditions and of course we first set foot on the moon in the dark shadowy area how do you be space exploration as a relative priority compared with the pressing needs of the domestic society and the world community at large well of course we all recognize that the world is continual - to neglect any of those areas and we certainly don't feel it it's on placement neglects the base exploration there was a lot of discussion during the flight during a decent hour decent corporation I don't think that either the ground people or ourselves really anticipated that this would happen it was not a serious program alarm it just told us that for a brief instant the computer was reaching a point of being over trying to solve these particular problems we wanted to be able to look out the window to identify the features as they came up so that we would be able to pinpoint just where in the landing ellipse the computer was taking suppose was carrying on a rapid-fire conversation with the computer at that point I think we really have to give the credit to the control center in this case they were the people that really kept what your feelings are is that perhaps the most difficult part of the mission or you looking forward to it well certainly with the part that we're least prepared to handle important piece of advice or recommendation for the Apollo 12 code poor and more dexterity with with arms moving and fingers moving these things are under study of course the Apollo 12 mission will have two different periods of vba one early in the mission and then sleep grade and then another evie a following that we've in general looked at their plans and talked to them about the duration we've talked to them about a brief period at the beginning of their EBA for their familiarization with the EBA v1 6g environment I don't think we have any particular recommendations for how they should change their mission it is a continuing evolvement of EBA capability and scientific exploration that they're undertaking on that plate here are now national heroes and you've had a couple of weeks in isolation in the lrl to think about that do you what are your initial feelings about being heroes how do you believe it will change your lives and do you think that maybe you'll get another chance to go to the moon or you're going to be too busy being heroes Ron preparing as that we had to prepare for Apollo 11 and in the lunar receiving laboratory we did have very little time for meditation it turns out that we are quite busy throughout the time period with the same sorts of things that the freeze of past flights have done after their place the debriefing schedules and writing the pilot reports and getting all the facts down for poor use of of all the people who will include that in future points I'm struck from the movies and the still pictures by the difference in the very hospital appearance of the moon when you're orbiting over it or some distance from it and the warmer colors and the relatively apparently relatively more friendly appearance of it when you're on the surface like to ask Colonel Collins if he gets that same impression from the pictures and the two of you who were on the moon what impression you have along though sometimes the moon that changes character as the angle of sunlight striking at surface changes at the very low Sun angles close to the Terminator dawn or at dusk it has the harsh forbidding characteristics which you've seen a lot of photographs on the other hand when the Sun is more closely overhead the midday situation that the moon is it takes on more of a of a brown color almost to or becomes almost a rosy looking place and a fairly friendly place so that from from gone through midday to dusk you you run the whole gamut of it starts out very forbidding becomes friendly and then becomes forbidding again is a similar difference well I think it requires some very pinpoint determination of the orbit that the vehicle is in before it begins powered descent and this requires extreme care in this is the this is what defines the the error ellipse where we might possibly land having targeted for the center now the ability to be able to control where you are requires that you be able to identify features and of course in our particular of significant features as possible to give us as a smoother terrain now in any area like this there are always certain identifying features that you can come out certain patterns or craters and to the extent that this can be used if the crew sees that they are not going exactly for the pre-planned form they can begin to honor and more on the landing that at anytime you consider an abort point we're getting the alarms and so forth well I safely do so and as soon as as soon as program alarms computer alarms manifest themselves why you realize that you have a possible abort situation to contend with but our procedure to write the vehicle down in the same way that it was programmed to do the only thing that was missing during this time period is that we did not have some of the displays on the computer keyboard and we had to make several entries at this time in order to clear up that area a would be to your private lives in the years ahead I wish I movie but I think the the landings of the type that are presently considered for the next number of flights are appropriate to the conclusions that we reached as a result of both our descent work and work on service that we are able to investigate them the variety of types of landing sites that they hope to do to come I have two brief questions I'd like to ask if I may when you were carrying out that incredible moonwalk did you find that the surface was equally firm anywhere or whether harder on softer spots that you could detect and secondly when you looked up at the sky could you actually see the stars and the silica River in spite of the glare and rather flat regions the the footprint would penetrate perhaps a half an inch or sometimes only a quarter of an inch and we have a very firm response in other regions near the edges of these craters we could find that the foot would would sink down maybe two three possibly four inches and in the slope of course the various edges of the footprint would might go on up to six or seven inches and compacting this material would would tend to produce a slight sideways motion as it was compacted on a material underneath it so we feel that you cannot always tell this by looking at the terrain what the exact resistance will be as their foot sinks into a point of firm contact so one must be quite cautious in moving around in this rough terrain we were never able to see stars from the lunar surface or on the daylight side of the Moon fight.i without looking through the optics I don't recall during the period of time that we were photographing the SONA curl of what what stars we could see I remember seeing any Neil you were a little bit concerned you said about stubbing your toe at the point of landing because the surface was obscured by dust you see a way around that kind of problem for future landing on the moon I think the simulations that we have at the present time to enable a pilot to understanding that the problems of a lunar landing that is a simulator and the various lunar landing training facilities and in trainers that we have will do that job sufficiently well above that I think it's just a matter of both pilot experience this for me of course the little bit of dispersions in the maneuvers such as the DLI burn on the backside of that ignition and there is no way of compensating until you get the final phase for that error based on your own experience and in space do you or any of you feel that there will ever be an opportunity for a woman to become an astronaut in our space program as you hope so I'd like to refer back something that Neil Armstrong said a while back that there was so much out there you would like to have done as it was you ended up a considerable number of minutes behind schedule is that because the shuttle was overloaded for the e VA or can we expect all astronauts when they reach them was the first time to enjoy themselves and spend as much time doing so as you seen do we plead guilty to enjoying ourselves I was mentioned earlier we're recommending that we we start future reviews with a 15 or 20 minute period to get these kinds of things out of the way get used to the surface and what you see adapt to the one-sixth G and the new green around and probably we just included a little more in the early phase then we were actually able to do two questions where did the weird sounds including the sirens and whistles come from during the trends earth coast so much more pronounced this for Oh mr. Armstrong had you plan to take over semi manual control or was it up manual phase then we would have planned in order to find a suitable what planning area many of us and many other people in many places have speculated on the meaning of this first landing on another body in space would each of you give us your estimate of what is the meaning of this to all of us yeah oh I believe with what this country set out to do was something that was going to be done sooner or later whether we set a specific goal or not I believe that from the early spaceflights we demonstrated a potential to carry out this type of emission and again it was the question of time until this would be accomplished I think the the relative ease with which we were able to carry out our mission which of course came after a very efficient neurological sequence of flights I think that just demonstrated that we were certainly on the right track when we took this commitment to to go to the moon I think that what this means is that many other problems perhaps can be solved in the same way by taking a commitment to solve them in a long time fashion I think that we were timely and accepting this mission of going to the moon it might be timely at this point to think in many other areas of other admissions that could be accomplished well to me they're near and far term aspects to it on the near term I think it's a a technical triumph for this country to have said what it was going to do a number of years ago and then by golly do it just like we said we were going to do it and I not just perhaps purely technical but also a triumph for the nation's overall determination will economy attention to detail and a thousand and one other factors that went into it at short term I think long term we point for the first time that man has the flexibility or the option of either walking this planet or some other planets be it the Moon or Mars or I don't know where and I'm really poorly equipped to evaluate to where that may lead us to I just see it as a beginning not just this flight but in this program which has really been a very short piece of human history an instant in history entire program it's a beginning of a new age meal how much descent fuel did you have left when you actually shut down my own instruments would have indicated less than 30 seconds probably something of 15 or 20 seconds I think the analysis of made here on the ground indicates there's something more than that probably greater than Thursday supporting accordion fed with sake could you tell us precisely what was going on at that time were you doctor and how the are you referring to the lunar orbiter docking woman's mr. Armstrong there in the last few minutes there when before the landing when the program you guys ladies and gentlemen welcome to the Maine spacecraft Center this is the Apollo 11 press conference the format today will consist of a 45 minute presentation by the Apollo 11 crew followed by question and answers well this time I'd like to introduce the Apollo 11 crew astronauts Neil Armstrong Michael Collins Edwin Aldrin Neil was our pleasure to have dissipated in one great adventure it's an adventure that took place not just in the month of July but rather one that took place in the last decade we all here and the people listening in today had the opportunity to share that adventure over its developing and unfolding in the past months and years it's our privilege today to share with you some of the details of that final month of July that was certainly the highlight for the three of us of that decking we're going to divert a little bit from the format of past press conferences and talk about the things that introd interested us most in particularly the things that occurred on and about the moon we will use a number of films and slides which most of you have already seen and with the intent of pointing out some of the things that we observed on the spot which may not be obvious to to those of you who are who are looking at them here from the south of the surface of earth the slide is you know started promptly and I think that was characteristic of of all the events of the flight the Saturn gave us one magnificent ride both into Earth orbit and on a trajectory to the moon our our memory of that actually differs little from the reports that you have all heard from from this previous Saturn by flight saying and those the previous flights served as well in preparation for this flight in the boost as well as the subsequent phases we would like to skip directly to the translunar Coast phase and remind ourselves of of the chain of events that long chain of events that actually permitted the landing starting with the undocking start the transposition and docking sequence this was our first look at the Magnificent machinery which had been behind us up until that point the booster of course the first and second stages have launched it separated but this shows the limb nestled inside the third stage yes for be after the translunar injection this manoeuvre was an interesting combination of manual and automated techniques in that we programmed the onboard computer to make the turnaround and then these final maneuvers were made completely manually as I approached the lam I had an easy time because I had a docking target which is not clearly visible here which allowed me to align the probe and the drug which is a dark spot you see on an upper right during this time I also checked out the proper vehicle response to my stick inputs and here shortly you'll see the actual docking somewhat speeded up there's a point of contact and in just a second you'll see a second right there a second small indication of the retract cycle when the twelve docking latches made we made two entries into the lunar module just as our first view of the inside of this the final activation was made on the day of our descent on the two previous days when we entered we remove and remove the probe ins growth and found that we've had a rather tunnel between the two vehicles on entering the lunar module one had to do a slight flip maneuver or a half-gainer to get into position for the lunar module of courses in a sense upside down relative to the command module this is in lunar orbit showing the separation of the lunar module from the command module is as viewed through my window this was a busy time for me and that I was taking these motion pictures through the right-hand window at the same time I was taking still photos through the left-hand window and also flying my vehicle and probably poorly and taking a close look at the lemons as he turned around my most important job here was to make sure that all his landing gear were wear down and properly locked prior to his decent and touchdown this is his yaw maneuver and the white dots you see are the landing gear pads this gives you a better idea of the detail available with the 70 millimeter of course this isn't still and chose the lemon either right side up or upside down I'm not sure which it looks more like the meat look like a praying mantis and it does the first-class flying machine in this view but it was a beautiful piece of machinery the the landing gear at the top and you can see the probes which indicate lunar contact has spin wires extending upward from Elena here of course before we could undock as is shown in this picture we had to complete the activation you know the day before we undocked we entered the LEM and went through an entire switch configuration check and we exercised the various communication modes in retrospect since we did have a little bit of communication problems on the following day during our decent we would recommend that we might take a more thorough check of this on the day before descent on the day that we did finally edit a LEM for the landing maneuver we went through a staggered sequence of shooting and we found that with all the simulations that we had run back here in Houston or with Houston tied with our simulations in the Cape that we were quite confident that we would be able to complete this LEM activation in the given time period which was approximately for hours we managed to get 30 minutes ahead of the time and it allowed us to get a more accurate platform alignment check at one point after the undocking maneuver we went through a brief radar check and then the command module executed a two-foot per second-- maneuver away from us so that we would both be able to independently exercise our guidance system through a star alignment checker which we did following this this separation maneuver now this occurred in the vicinity close to the landing site and you can see at this point if a man module is traveling right over the center of our targeted point is approaching now what we call the cat's paw following this separation maneuver on the backside of the moon we made a decent orbit insertion which is slightly over 70 foot per second maneuver that lowers our altitude down to 50,000 feet we had two guidance systems working for us they behaved perfectly both of them agreed extremely closely as to the results of this maneuver following this we use the radar to confirm the actual departure rate from the command module this is a view of the descent trajectory area is viewed through the lam window during our activation in the bottom right of the photograph is the crater masculine and the bottom center is the mountain called Boot Hill immediately above Boot Hill is a small sharpened crater called masculine W which was the crater that we use to determine our down range and cross range position error prior to completing the final phases of the descent the landing area itself is in is in the smooth area at the top of the picture just before we arrive at the shadow on what's called the Terminator we had seen a number of pictures from Apollo's 8 & 10 which gave us an excellent understanding of the ground track over which we would pass during the descent we're now looking up the right hand window of the crater and there is masculine w it occurred approximately approximately 2 to 3 seconds late and gave us the clue that we would probably land somewhat long after after completing those position checks we rolled over face up so that the landing radar could lock on the ground and confirm our actual altitude this picture doesn't show it but at this phase in the trajectory we were looking out directly at the planet Earth in the final phases of descent after a number of program alarms we looked at the landing area and found a very large crater just in the very left top corner of the picture the the camera is located in the right window looks to the right and it just barely sees this boulder field we're passing over right now we're at 400 feet and those boulders are about ten feet across this was the area which we decided we would not go into extended the range downrange and saw this crater which we passed over this 80-foot crater in the final phases of descent and later took some pictures up now you can see the exhaust being the exhaust dust being kicked up by the by the engine and this was some concern in that it degraded our ability to determine not only our altitude and altitude grade in the final phases but also and probably more importantly our translational velocities over the ground it's quite important not to stub your toe during the final phases of a touchdown and once once settled on the surface the the dust cleared immediately and we had an excellent view of the area surrounding a limb this is the view out the left window it shows a cratered surface pockmarked with craters up to 15 20 30 feet and many smaller craters down to a diameter of 1 foot and of course the surface was very fine-grained we could tell that from from our view out the window but there were a surprisingly large number of rocks of all sizes this is the view out the right window up close to the horizon you see a boulder field that was probably deposited by some of the impacts and the craters that were behind us you see most of the craters have rounded edges however there is a variation in the the age of these as we can tell by the sharpness of the edge of the crater the immediate foreground area we'll see more pictures of the flat terrain in contrast to some of the more rolling terrain we could see out the front window and out the left window you you you you"

moonlanding,"There are some genuinely strange anomalies on the Moon that have yet to be fully explained. Lunar bases have been reported by astronauts, there are many other people who have pointed out numerous highly strange and irregular things about the moon. NASA has photographs revealing a large complex on the lunar surface that included numerous structures-- towers, spherical buildings and mushroom-shaped buildings these have never been made public. Remote viewers even found something astounding on the dark side on the moon.

from any official authorities be it mainstream science or government that there may be something otherworldly going on on the contrary there's often ridicule and avoidance whatever the subject comes up yet most of the general public believes that extraterrestrial UFOs exist and that the government is hiding information from us many people have had encounters of sightings themselves however most people don't give it much attention or thought believing that it doesn't really affect us anyway and that we'll deal with it once official contact has been made but what if the alien civilization is influencing mankind and the world at large for thousands of years what would be the implications our views on life in existence science and religion spirituality and evolution consciousness and psychology as well as reality as we know it would take on a whole new understanding when looking deeper into the UFO phenomena and the possibility of a higher alien intelligence affecting our world perhaps were not the main show here on earth and maybe not even the top of the food chain it seems like the people of Earth have been waiting for an alien civilization to make themselves known for decades what they may not know is that they've already shown up unexpectedly close to us however the powers that be decided we were not psychologically ready for it these extraterrestrial beings were detected close to our home on the moon however this discovery was immediately classified as secret here's an extract from the official press release NASA scientists and engineers participating in exploration of Mars and the moon reported the results of their discoveries at a briefing at the Washington National Press Club on March 21st 1996 it was announced for the first time that man-made structures and objects have been discovered on the moon the scientists spoke rather cautiously and evasive ly about these objects they mentioned that the man-made objects are possible and stated the information was still under study and official results will be published later it was mentioned at the briefing as well that Russia has photos proving the presence of such activity on the moon what the new policy directive does is it places a greater emphasis on the moon as the next step beyond low-earth orbit I think it's time for us to move out and get flying again engage our partners engage our international partners and look at the ways that we can do things differently and still get these missions done we've got a lot of people that want to help us here 45 years ago 1972 the last time an astronaut walked on the moon on Monday that retired astronaut Harrison Schmitt gave President Donald Trump a memento after he signed a directive ordering the us to send explorers back to the moon will learn the directive I'm signing today will refocus America's space program on human exploration and discovery it marks an important step in returning American astronauts to the moon for the first time since 1972 for long-term exploration and use this time we will not only plant our flag and leave our footprint we will establish a foundation for an eventual mission to Mars and the moon is the next feasible step Mars remains an inspiring horizon goal that we need to be working toward but we first need to walk out of the neighborhood before we can run the united states has shunned the Paris climate agreement but it has big plans beyond planet Earth President Trump wants to send American astronauts back to the moon and to places no man has ever gone before Trump's first space policy directive orders NASA to refocus on human exploration and discovery 45 years after its last Apollo mission to the moon and although it wasn't identified what kind of activity it was thousands of photos and video materials from the Apollo's and the Clementine space station showed many parts of the lunar surface where this activity were easily identifiable the video films and photos made by US astronauts during the Apollo program were demonstrated at this briefing some scientists were puzzled as to why these extraordinary findings had not been presented to the public NASA specialists answered it was difficult to forecast the reaction of public to information that some creatures had been or still are on the moon in addition there were other reasons which were beyond the control of NASA specialists in lunar studies Richard Hoagland says that NASA is still altering photo materials before they're published in public catalogs and files they do some retouching or are partially refocusing them while copying some investigators Hoagland is among them suppose that an extraterrestrial race has used the moon as a terminal station during their activity on the earth these suggestions are confirmed by the legends and myths of different nations of our planet the ruins of lunar city stretch for many kilometers huge domes on massive basements numerous tunnels and other constructions caused scientists to reconsider their opinions concerning the moon how the moon appeared and principles of its revolving around the earth still pose a great problem for scientists some partially destroyed objects on the lunar surface do not resemble natural geological formations they are complex geometrical structure that do not seem to have been formed naturally they look artificial in the upper part of rima Hadley not far from the place where Apollo 15 in landed a construction surrounded by a tall D shaped wall was discovered as of now different artifacts have been discovered in 44 regions the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and the Houston planetary Institute have investigated these regions but the findings were not made public mysterious terra shaped excavations of rock have been discovered near the Tycho crater the concentric hexahedral excavations and the tunnel entry on the terrace side can't be the results of natural geological processes instead they look very much like opencast mines a transparent dome raised above the crater edge was discovered near the crater Copernicus the dome is unusual as it glows white and blue from the inside a rather strange object which is unusual even for the moon was discovered in the upper part of the factory area a disk of about 50 meters in diameter stands on a square basement surrounded with walls in this picture close to the room we can see a dark round opening on the ground which resembles an entry to an underground Kappa near there is a rectangular area between factory and the crater Copernicus which is 300 meters wide 400 meters long Apollo 10 astronauts took a photo of a one-mile-long object called Castle which is at the height of 14 kilometers and cast a distinct shadow on the lunar surface the object seems to consist of several cylindrical units and a large conjunctive unit the internal porous structure of the castle is clearly seen in one of the pictures which gives the impression that some parts of the object are transparent when Richard Hoagland requested originals of the castle pictures for the second time no pictures were found at all they disappeared even from the list of pictures made by the Apollo 10 crew only immediate pictures of the object were found in the archives which unfortunately don't depict the internal structure of the object when the Apollo 12 crew landed on the lunar surface they saw that the landing was observed by a half transparent pyramidal object it was hovering just several meters above the lunar surface and shimmering with all the colors of the rainbow against the black sky in 1969 when the film about astronauts traveling to the sea of storms was shown the astronauts saw the strange objects once again which were later called striped glasses NASA was finally beginning to understand that there was something else on the moon astronaut Edgar Mitchell rather strangely was quoted as saying my neck still aches as I had to constantly turn my head around because we felt we were not alone there we had no choice but to pray ken Johnston who worked at the Houston Space Center and studied photos and video taken during the Apollo program discussed photos which seemed to show artifacts with Richard Hoagland and said that the NASA leadership was starting to panic because they had discovered a great number of enamel as' objects on the moon it was even said that the piloted flights to the moon were going to be haunted many investigators are especially interested in the ancient structures resembling partially destroyed cities photos reveal an astonishingly regular geometry of square and rectangular constructions they resemble our cities seen from the height of five to eight kilometers a Mission Control specialist commented on the picture our guys observed ruins of the lunar city's transparent pyramids domes and God knows what else which are currently hidden deep inside the NASA safes he recalled out one astronaut had commented that he felt like Robinson Crusoe when he suddenly came across prints of bare feet on the surface of the Moon what do geologists and scientists say after studying the pictures of lunar cities and other anomalous objects they say that such objects can't be natural formations one stated we should admit they're artificial especially the domes and pyramids there have been many books written on this subject let's look at the theories put forth way back in 1976 in the book somebody else is on the moon by George H Leonard his conclusions were fantastic even outrageous at the time but all referenced point-by-point with quotes from NASA personnel and various experts in geology astronomy and other scientific fields he had a group of experts working with them on the visual analysis of lunar photographs the book is full of sketches detailing the things he found Leonard started with the basic mysteries of the moon like where did it come from is it too large relative to the mass of the earth to have been gravitationally captured if it was moving fast enough to be simply deflected it would have had to make not just one but several wide orbital passes each and every one at precisely the right angle before it could have settled into a stable orbit the sequence of events seems quite improbable yet according to scientists it may be the least impossible option we have right now although there are many other theories that the earth is the only place in the solar system where one can see a total eclipse is also quite on the apparent diameter of the moon seen from the surface of the earth is exactly the same as the apparent diameter of the Sun that seems like one hell of a coincidence especially considering how difficult it is to explain how the moon managed to establish a stable orbit the bottom line scientific argument is that it did so therefore it must have been possible now then if the moon was parked there one more oddity is also solved Luna is said to be title locked gravitationally held with one side always facing the earth a consequence of having two large bodies in proximity this implies that the moon was initially spinning but slowed down over time due to the gravitational drag given even more time the mass of the moon slowly migrated earthward resulting in a pear shape with the narrow end pointed outward somehow this was accomplished without pulling the whole body crashing down from orbit some suggest the moon was molten and formed the pear shape as it cooled well if you spin clay on a potter's wheel you get a round pot if that molten mass was not spinning why would it form a planetoid anyway it would have had to have been rolling churning perpendicular to the Earth's axis to allow the migration of material that we see if however it was placed there deliberately with one side intentionally oriented earthward like most of our artificial satellites then the tidal bulge is more reasonably explained it would most likely be a feature of the original sign there would be a logical way to ensure that one side would in fact remain pointed at earth let's return to Leonard George Leonard studied thousands of the photos in the NASA moon archives noting artificial constructions and machinery all over the place he talked to amateur astronomers and NASA personnel and said he was generally well-received the only real exception to this he cites is an occasional encounter with the bureaucratic labyrinth when seeking some particular photo he would be told it was not at that location in some other file labeled with a different stock number by some other agency and some of his requests were not processed at all this might have simply been normal government behavior certainly he was not greeted with a big smile and a hearty come let us show you what we are hiding it seemed clear to him that the photo evidence of intelligent activity on the moon was a subject that NASA did not wish to address in fact NASA is and always has been loath to discuss such possibilities nevermind what appears on the photos nevermind the anomalies astronomers amateur and professional have thought they spotted for hundreds of years well peculiar occurrences and odd formations are certainly good fodder for scholarly papers and grant requests any suggestion of artificially or intelligent design is usually met with ridicule the main tool used for the lunar cover-up has always been disdain you don't see that because it isn't there Leonard made sketches out of the things he found and tended to settle on an observational theory of somebody carrying out mining operations he drew spidery machines that would be as large as small cities noting the tracks they left on the crater floor as they chewed away at the rim he states in the preface to this book that no I don't know who they are no I don't know where they come from no I don't know precisely what their purpose is but he did favor the idea of aliens being responsible probably more than one type of alien rather than people from here he did not completely rule out the possibility of a clandestine terrestrial space program but he felt that since this could not explain the long history of observed moon anomalies it was less likely to be a factor there's a lot that one could read between the lines of his one and only book if one was so inclined he's one of those authors who occasionally seems to be trying to very subtly imply an additional vector or layer this could have been his way of holding back from making an overly tight fit of the data into his theories which he repeatedly cautions are incomplete or it could have meant something else perhaps there was more to George H Leonard than at first apparent there's a reason why professional astronomers almost all of whom are tied in one way or another to government funding shy away from pointing their big telescopes at the moon they affect a blasé attitude of indifference towards our nearest neighbor because if they do look they see unusual things Leonard makes note of this and the situation has not changed in the year sense most lunar observation that we know of is done by amateurs there have been plenty of probes launched at the moon but except for the Lick Observatory photo taken in the 1950s there has been relatively little ground-based investigation by major observatories especially in the US Leonard believed that the Apollo missions landed on the moon though he was careful to steer clear of theories that went beyond the data he had accumulated he did however speculate as Richard Hoagland commented a necessary part of Sciences speculation no guts no glory Leonard speaks of many conversations with insiders people who knew what the secrets were apparently much of the feedback he received in those chants was of the year on the right track or look at such-and-such variety this frustrated him greatly no one wanted to really spill the beans it seemed they wanted him to do it but wouldn't tell him what there was that needed spelling the other possibility which he doesn't state directly but which had obviously occurred in was that they didn't actually have any confidence that they really knew the answers there were aliens and there were politics involved there was spinning going on basic life advice includes don't spill while you're spinning it can be very messy while doing his research Leonard found an unusual quote chosen by NASA this one leading into the preliminary science report published by the Apollo 17 mission there's nothing more difficult to take in hand or perilous to conduct or more uncertain in its success than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things even before we tell you the name of the author you may have already been slightly startled by the last four words but that is of course just a coincidence of contemporary context right the author lived some time ago in 16th century Italy his name was niccolò machiavelli let's now take a look at what is actually going on up there on that most ancient of artificial satellites for hundreds of years observers including Plato Aristophanes and Aristarchus have reported the appearance of mysterious lunar transient phenomena in the early 19th century Sir John Herschel in England saw unidentified lights on the moon during an eclipse hey what are the delights on a dark side and noted that some of the lights appeared to be moving above the moon other astronomers of the period reported seeing geometrical patterns of lights that resembled city streets on July 29th 1953 John O'Neill observed a 19 kilometers long bridge straddling the crater mayor Crisium following the report of his discovery to the association of lunar and planetary observers he was subjected to verbal attack from a number of astronomers however just one month later famous British astronomer dr. H Wilkins verified his sighting since that time other equally strange objects have been photographed on the lunar surface The Shard an obelisk shaped object discovered in 1968 towers nearly two and a half kilometers above the ukirt area of the moon's surface and another feature the tower is an amazing spire that rises more than eight kilometres from the sinus many region dr. bruce Cornett a geologists and paleontologists who submitted these photographs to laboratory study commented no known natural process can explain such structures as far as the Apollo missions are concerned rumors have circulated for years about what the astronauts are reported to have witnessed on the lunar surface in above top-secret the worldwide UFO cover-up Timothy good stated that former NASA chief of communication systems Maurice Shannon claimed that astronaut Neil Armstrong viewed two UFOs resting on the rim of a crater the encounter was common knowledge in NASA but nobody has talked about it until now Soviet scientist dr. vladimir sasha eight physics and mathematics professor has stated neil armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that two large mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the moon module but this message was censored by NASA in general the astronauts nearly all military officers controlled by security regulations have maintained a united front however there have been exceptions dr. Edgar Mitchell on The Oprah Winfrey Show of July 19 1992 suggested that all information regarding UFOs had not been released adding I do believe that there's a lot more known about extraterrestrial investigation than is available to the public right now and has been for a long time it's a long long story it goes back to World War two when all of that happened and is highly classified stuff Colonel Gordon Cooper in a letter to a meeting of the United Nations in 1978 to discuss UFOs stated I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets which are obviously a little more advanced than we are here on earth any interested person looking back at the objectives stated by NASA at the beginning of the Apollo lunar program would have to wonder what went wrong why did these missions come to a complete halt after Apollo 17 many members of the public and most scientists queried the end of the moon missions when more questions than answered were being generated by the flights it's like buying a rolls-royce and then not driving it because you want to save money on gasoline complain dr. Thomas Gould professor of astronomy at Cornell University Jim Marrs an alien agenda writes that moon researcher George Leonard observed that prior to the lunar landings there was much media speculation on the profitable aspects of a colony and mining operations on the moon all such talk ended abruptly after the Apollo missions were cancelled we put enough billions into the u.s. space program to pull all the major cities of America out of debt and then some and after the successful Ranger Surveyor orbiter and Apollo flights we dropped man lunar exploration like a hot potato he noted why haven't we been back to the moon is the question many people are still asking in an attempt to find some answers to this question let us shift our attention to psi research and specifically to the mental process that makes possible the perception of details from distant locations bridging the normal constraints of time and space namely remote viewing RV a book by perhaps the most highly regarded and experienced remote viewer Ingo Swann entitled penetration the question of extraterrestrial and human telepathy provides yet another dimension of speculation to the lunar question were it not for swans long and distinguished career as perhaps the father of RV as a remote viewer for u.s. military intelligence as well as his involvement is a renowned psi researcher instructor and writer then there would be no hesitation in completely omitting his strange claims from this documentary in 1973 Ingo Swann saw a ring of rocks circling the planet Jupiter something that no one had even imagined at that time as far as astronomy was concerned Saturn was the only planet with a ring system astronomers had dismissed his claims as nonsense science later confirmed all of his findings in 1975 two years after the pioneer space probe had revealed the high level of accuracy of the information about Jupiter that Swann had previously obtained by RV he was approached for a different mission this led to a chain of events that can only be described as bizarre including a long journey under strict supervision by twin guards by car helicopter and elevator wearing a hood to ensure no likelihood of place recognition including in an underground facility here he met the mysterious mr. Axelrod who's completely familiar with swans work at the Stanford Research Institute and who persuaded Swann in return for $1,000 a day to undertake an RV mission that's so secret that it exists without any paper trail a condition of his employment is that he agrees not to reveal any details of his assignment for at least 10 years having been assured that after that time the mission would have disappeared after a period of time during which Swann and mr. Axelrod discussed the protocols of our V the latter finally gets to the purpose of the mission Ingo Swans task was to remote view a specific section of the Moon Swan reflected I had no idea what mr. Axelrod wanted maybe they whoever they were were looking for places to build moon bases maybe they had lost a secret spacecraft or something along those lines at his initial RV session Swann realizes that his coordinates are for the far side of the Moon he viewed whitish sand with some sort of repeated pattern like rows of large tractor treads on the sand and becomes a little confused when he senses something like an atmosphere at this point he's given another set of coordinates and finding himself in an entirely different sight believes that he's back on earth so he apologizes has a break and then tries again using the same coordinates as before only to find he's seeing the same thing Swann is quoted as saying I'm in a place which is sort of down like in a crater I suppose there's a strange green haze like a light of some kind beyond that all around his dark though I'm wondering where the light is coming from I jumped into a stop again after a moment axel prodded yes what else well you won't like this I guess I see or at least I think I see well some actual lights sort of like lights at football arenas high up banks of them up on towers of some kind axel stared at Swann for a moment he was not smiling well I see lights but how can they be on the moon there was no answer forthcoming from Axel Swan pressed onwards have the Russians built a moon base or something is that what I'm supposed to remote view again no answer how high are the light towers axel interrupted but Swann carried on with the viewing well if I compared to something I'm familiar with in New York about as high as the Secretariat building at the United Nations which has 32 floors in it axel narrowed his lips you can see that then Swann asked am I then to assume that this stuff is on the moon if so this is more than a moon base isn't it excellent again no answer so he continued but this stuff is big this NASA or the Soviet space program have the capabilities of getting such large stuff on the moon as he talked himself through all this a certain glimmer began to dawn in the recesses of his mental darkness Swan suddenly stops speaking staring and credulous Liat axel you mean I am to assume that this stuff is not ours not made on earth axel raised his eyebrows trying to grin quite a surprise isn't it he said after more lunar visits Ingo Swann finds towers lights machinery and strange-looking buildings a lot of domes of various sizes round things like small saucers with windows these were stored next to crater sites sometimes in caves sometimes in what looked like airfield hangars long tube-like things machinery tractor like things that were going up and down hills obelisks which have no apparent function there were large platforms on domes large cross leg structures holes being dug into crater walls and floors obviously having to do with some kind of mining or earth moving operations finally he sees some kind of entities or humanoids busy working in a dark lime-green fog who start talking excitedly and gesticulating in his direction he writes immediately I felt like running away and hiding which I guess I physically did since I lost sight of this particular imaging I think they've spotted me axel axel said in a calm low voice so low I hardly heard it at first please come away from that place my eyes were wide as understanding drained in you already know their psychic don't you axel raised his eyebrows and gave a deep sigh and at that point he abruptly closed his folders I think we'd better end our work here another telling reason why we never went back to the moon came from a prominent professor who wished to remain anonymous he was engaged in a discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA symposium professor what really happened out there with Apollo 11 Armstrong it was incredible of course we had always known there was a possibility the fact is we were warned off by the aliens there was never any question then of a space station or a moon city professor how do you mean warned off Armstrong I can't go into details except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology boy were they big and menacing no there's no question of a space station professor but NASA had other missions after Apollo 11 Armstrong naturally NASA was committed at that time and couldn't risk panic on earth but it really was a quick scoop and backing it armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further detail beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up why haven't we returned to the moon because we found a lot more there than some moon rocks NASA discovered the existence of an alien base with buildings towers and other structures unfortunately NASA's decided the best way to handle it is to deny their existence they can cover up what they want history and irrefutable evidence confirmed that aliens are right now living on the Dark Side of the Moon keeping track of our every move"
moonlanding,,Phases of the Moon: Astronomy and Space for Kids - FreeSchool,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4ZHdzl6ZWg,0,1135100,2808,431,151,f4ZHdzl6ZWg,"You're watching FreeSchool! It's the brightest and most noticeable object
 in the night sky, but if you spend much time observing it, you will see that the moon is
 never quite the same from one night to the next. The moon has something we call 'phases,' which
 means that it appears to change shape a little bit every night. To understand why this happens,
 we need to talk a little bit about the way the Earth and the moon move together in space. The moon orbits around the Earth, much like
 the Earth orbits the sun. However, while the Earth takes about 365 days to travel once
 around the sun - one year - the moon completes its orbit around the Earth in only 29 and
 a half days - or about one month. That's actually where the idea of months came
 from - the time it takes for the moon to complete one orbit around the Earth - and the words
 'moon' and 'month' come from the same root. Despite how bright it looks in the sky, the
 moon does not have any light of its own. It only appears to shine brightly in the sky
 because light from the sun hits it and bounces off. Just like the Earth, the moon has a day
 side and a night side, with half of it in sunlight and half of it in darkness at any
 one time. As the moon travels through its orbit around the Earth, that dividing line
 between day and night, called the terminator, is visible from different angles, giving the
 impression that different amounts of the moon are lit up on different days. The cycle of lunar phases begins with the
 'new moon.' At new moon, the moon appears completely dark because the unlit side is
 facing the Earth. New moon is the only time in the lunar cycle when a solar eclipse could
 happen, because it is the only time that the moon is between the sun and the Earth. After a few days, once the moon has moved
 along a little in its orbit, we can begin to see some of the moon's day side from Earth.
 What we see is just a thin slice of light, called a crescent. We call it a 'waxing crescent,'
 because 'waxing' means 'growing.' The crescent moon will grow a little bit thicker every
 night until it reaches the next phase: first quarter. The first quarter moon is sometimes called
 the half moon because it appears to us that half of the moon is illuminated, but it is
 called 'first quarter' because the moon is one-quarter of the way through its cycle. As the days pass, the moon continues to grow,
 soon entering its next phase, the waxing gibbous. Gibbous means 'humped' or 'swollen,' and again,
 we call it waxing because it grows thicker every night until it reaches the next phase,
 the full moon. A full moon is the biggest, brightest, and
 easiest phase of the moon to see. The moon rises at sunset and is up all night, so if
 you are outside and the sky is clear, it's hard to miss. The moon is halfway through
 its orbit around the Earth, and is now on the opposite side of the Earth from the sun.
 During a full moon is the only time that a lunar eclipse can happen, because that is
 the only time that the Earth's shadow could fall on the moon. As the moon continues in its path, it appears
 to shrink again as we begin to see more and more of its dark side. A few days after the
 full moon the moon will be a gibbous again, but this time it's a waning gibbous. 'Waning'
 means shrinking, or getting smaller, and so the moon will be waning for the rest of its
 orbit. The next phase is another half moon, but this
 time it's called 'third quarter' or sometimes 'last' or 'final' quarter, because the moon
 is three-quarters of the way through its orbit. Soon the half moon shrinks into a waning crescent,
 which will continue to shrink night after night until it vanishes completely into the
 next new moon. Big and bright and beautiful, different every
 night but repeating the same cycle over and over, the moon is one of the best objects
 in the sky to observe, especially for someone just getting started. The next time you look
 up and see the moon in the sky, take a moment and see if you can identify which phase of
 the moon you're seeing, and try to figure out which one will come next."

world tuned into their television sets during a monumental scientific achievement of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin but have you ever heard the full story join us as we have a look at some secrets about the Apollo 11 moon landing takeoff was dangerous the Apollo Saturn rockets were so jam-packed with fuel that it was capable of throwing 100 pounds of shrapnel up to three miles now there probably should have been some kind of warning for civilians and onlookers to keep a safe distance NASA wasn't really even sure that the rocket would make it out of the atmosphere and as such they couldn't rule out the possibility that it may just explode on takeoff they did however know that the shrapnel would be flying great distances and that's why they seated all the VIP spectators exactly three and a half miles away from the launch pad anti-diarrhea drugs with the luxury of today's toilets and accessories like bidets who would have guessed that scientists had not quite figured out how to use the bathroom in zero gravity those poor astronauts aboard the Apollo 11 were like some sort of scientific lab rats that had to resort to using other means to relieve themselves the drinking water was a fuel-cell by-product but since the hydrogen gas filters didn't work every drink turned out bubbly the American astronauts finally discovered what it was like to visit Europe and not know how to order tap water all you're getting is bubbly water they're so drink that carbonation and feel fancy for a few seconds at least one astronaut and possibly more had to resort to using anti diarrhea drugs during the entire mission to avoid any mishaps inside their spacesuits planting the flag was an ordeal one of the most monumental moments in history did not come easily or even quickly for the astronauts aboard the follow eleven putting the flag into the moon to be so much more difficult than what was anticipated NASA studies suggest that the lunar surface would be soft but armstrong and aldrin discovered that this was actually not the case and the surface was covered by hard rock and that hard rock was covered by a thin layer of dust sitting on top they did manage to get a flagpole just a few inches into the ground but had to be extremely careful when leaving so they didn't accidentally knock it over the lunar landing was in HD now it's hard to imagine that it would take about 40 years to come out with HD technology and that it was available for the lunar landing although it couldn't be streamed into households across the world astronauts did get to film themselves in high-definition and it was done so for the first time ever as cool as it sounds now if you've ever seen a video of the lunar landing from 1969 then you're going to be familiar with the grainy feed that almost every other household in America was seeing it was actually captured in much higher quality though that's because nasa's camera was able to capture video in a format that wasn't quite available yet for household television sets fortunately however there are some pretty amazing digitally restored versions on NASA's website if you ever want to take a peek and see this monumental moment in history how it should have been originally captured the first words on the moon Neil Armstrong seems to get all of the credit for his famous quote but it wasn't the first lunar sentence the first person to speak was actually Buzz Aldrin and he didn't have quite the appeal with his quote of ok engine stop but we do have to give him credit where credit is due because technically speaking he gets to gloat about being the first one to ever utter a word on the lunar surface accidents happen ok so Neil Armstrong may have been the first man to step foot on the moon but he couldn't possibly outdo Aldrin in this category Buzz Aldrin was the first to urinate on the moon in fact he emptied his bladder into his space suits urine Collector the moment that he stepped foot on the lunar surface he made a higher-than-expected leap and his urine collector would break sending pee into his boot which sounds both disgusting and uncomfortable Aldrin had to keep his cool though because he was on a live radio feed and we're pretty sure that he had some laughs once he got back to safety life insurance wasn't available for the crew as it turns out insurance companies didn't have a whole lot of faith in NASA or the Apollo 11 crew and that meant that life insurance premiums for the three astronauts were going to be astronomical themselves and far too expensive the astronauts did have a clever plan though because they decided to sign hundreds of postal covers so if they didn't return their families could make a mint off of selling the signatures as it turns out their plan was brilliant because even today those same signatures can still sell for thousands of dollars hypothetical moon disaster the days of Richard Nixon weren't all bad if you ignore the blatant corruption and greed during his term however you have to admit that he knew just how to handle hypothetical disasters take for instance the fact that his speechwriter William Safire had to write him a statement just in case something went wrong on the moon thankfully Nixon didn't have to deliver any bad news but we have to admit that some of the statement is fairly poetic given the sombre reality of what would have happened if the Apollo 11 had failed quote fate has ordained that men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace end quote that statement ended up becoming quote one giant leap for mankind Aldrin was religious atheism advocate Madalyn Murray O'Hair objected to government employees praying publicly and happened to be suing NASA at the time of the Apollo 11 mission that meant that Buzz Aldrin would have to keep his religious practice to himself and private no bless the astronaut took a Christian communion including a wafer and a thimble full of wine which was prepared for him by his pastor this whole ceremony was kept secret because it was technically not prohibited to do so but Aldrin let Neil Armstrong in on the secret NASA advised Aldrin not to take the communion during the live broadcast of the lunar landing however they didn't specifically say that he couldn't Armstrong was an ace pilot now there probably won't be too many complaints about being an amazing pilot if you're expected to conduct the very first moon landing and that's why Neil Armstrong was highly sought after it turns out that he may have been a little too good of a pilot though Armstrong was supposed to cut the engines when the lander was just a few feet from the surface but he managed to land the rocket ship too softly on the surface of the moon what actually occurred was that he landed it so perfectly and the Landers legs never crumbled so the two astronauts had to leap from the door to land on the surface instead of being able to just step down the Eagle almost ran out of gas the Eagle was the name of the rocket ship that was controlled by Neil Armstrong during the mission as was stated before Armstrong was an ace pilot that could handle any situation however one predicament could have ended catastrophic Lee in the hands of someone else Neil Armstrong almost ran out of gas while landing the eagle on the moon's surface mission control became frantic believing that he may actually crash but one of the engineers knew that there was a chance the exhaust would shoot back into the rocket as it landed igniting the remaining propellant all of their worries turned out to be just that and the Apollo 11 mission became a success but it was in great part because of Neil Armstrong's amazing pilot skills the flag wasn't the only thing left on the moon every item that was left on the moon was thoughtfully placed there by two astronauts in the flag which was designed by Sears Roebuck wasn't the only thing left behind the astronauts also left their backpacks half of the Apollo moon landing module and a few other sentimental items along with a patch from the never launched Apollo 1 mission this ended prematurely as flames engulfed the command module during training exercises in 1967 killing three US astronauts medals were also left behind commemorating pioneering Soviet cosmonauts Vladimir Komarov and Yuri Gagarin who both died in flight in 67 and 68 the cosmonauts were astronauts of the Soviet Russian space program 73 world leaders wrote goodwill messages which Armstrong and Aldrin left and a small gold olive-branch pin was left in the symbol of peace if any potential other life-forms happen to stumble across the items we think that they got the message a pen saved the Apollo 11 crews lives as it turns out a felt-tip pen can actually come in handy especially during an Apollo 11 mission when Buzz Aldrin basically coined the term MacGyver in outer space that's because he had to use his felt tip pen to activate a broken circuit breaker which enabled the Eagle to blast off from the moon the two astronauts noticed something on the floor of the rocket ship which just so happened to be the circuit breaker switch it had been bumped and was broken off in the crammed environment but this wasn't just any kind of switch that you could buy at a Best Buy or a hardware store it was the circuit breaker that activated the entire engine which would lift them off of the moon and back to their next destination of safety if they couldn't get the breaker in there there would be no way to escape and they wouldn't have lasted long with just tang and astronaut food the pen would turn out to be pretty useful since it was made especially for NASA's Apollo missions it had to be able to write without the use of gravity and it also just happened to save their lives even astronauts go through customs and security checks you know that dreaded moment when you're flying internationally and you realize that long line waiting for you is your ticket into another country well just be astronauts are conducting a really important mission for science does it mean that they can just squeak past security and customs in fact the three astronauts from the Apollo 11 were brought back in Hawaii and upon their entry they had to be processed like any other traveler being expected to fill out customs declarations they only declared their moon dust and moon rock and simply wrote their destination as the moon but it's pretty amazing that such documents were still required perhaps they should have just been happy that they made it back from the mission instead of making the astronauts fill out mundane paperwork when they returned to Earth Pan Am flight 6 leaving from sunny Honolulu and headed to San Francisco PanAm flight 6 left the runway piloted by captain Richard auch around halfway through the duration of the flight the plane would gain altitude but then the power input dropped and one of the engines began to over speed which for those of you who don't know it's when an engine spins faster than it was designed to do the first office

No doubt you’ve heard some of the completely unexplainable stories about the moon.  There are the enigmatic structures that made front-page news of major new publications… but were then dismissed from all media, and even photo-shopped out of photos.  There are the strange “lunar wave” videos of recent years, which seem to show the moon’s image actually jumping - as though it were a projected hologram; and.. you only need to search YouTube to see hundreds of entirely credible videos of strange lights, flurries, and unidentified flying aircraft departing and landing on the surface of the moon.  
Yet, the US supposedly quit landing on the moon in 1973, was our every scientific question answered?   Why are these credible testimonies ignored… or dismissed?    Could there be more to that ball in the sky than meets the eye

If you research the moon, you might be surprised.  Its reference in ancient history, its perfect geometrical symmetry, astronaut testimonies, all seem to point to only one logical conclusion:   that our moon is most likely a hollowed out structure, and an artificial satellite, that was intentionally placed into Earth’s orbit only a few hundred thousand years ago – and that the advanced engineers accomplished this intending not only to influence the Earth’s biology but to oversee and control her inhabitants.

photoshopped out of photos there are the strange lunar wave videos of recent years which seemed to show the moon's image actually jumping as though it were a projected hologram and you only need to search YouTube to see hundreds of entirely credible videos of strange lights flurries and unidentified flying aircraft departing and landing on the surface of the Moon yet the u.s. supposedly quit landing on the moon almost 50 years ago in 1973 was our every scientific question answered why are all these credible testimonies ignored or dismissed could there be more to that ball in the sky than meets the eye if you research the moon you might be surprised its reference in ancient history it's perfect geometrical symmetry and even astronaut testimonies all seemed to point to only one logical conclusion that our Moon is most likely a hollowed-out structure and an artificial satellite that was intentionally placed into Earth's orbit only a few hundred thousand years ago and that the advanced engineers accomplished this intending not only to influence the Earth's biology but to oversee and control her inhabitants you the moon seems as natural as the landscape around us but when you look at all the freakish facts you'd see what one NASA researcher Robin Brett saw he said it seems easier to explain the non-existence of the moon than it does to explain its existence so then why is that for starters no one can explain why the moon is older than the earth and older by millions of years none of the collision with earth theories make even a shred of sense secondly if the moon were proportional to the planet it orbits as other natural satellites are it would only be 30 miles across instead it's not double not triple but over 72 times larger at 2160 miles across no other known natural satellites are a quarter of the size of the planet that they orbit then there are the craters the varying diameters of the craters reveal impacts of varying size and force they should have created a variety of depth but instead the craters all have the same depth and when astronauts attempted to drill into the craters they were barely able to penetrate the surface they also discovered processed metals like brass mica and pure titanium which are not naturally occurring elements they are created and used for architectural design where it really gets strange though is when you examine the mathematical and geometrical relationship between the Sun Moon and Earth which are so freakishly precise they defy all odds of randomness with nothing like it in any other known planetary system for example the Sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and it's almost 400 times the distance away but that's just the beginning there are the coincidences around the numbers three six six four the numbers 1 0 9 2 and then the numbers 2 7 3 if you calculate the likelihood of this kind of precision in a random creation the number would be so small it wouldn't fit on the screen one of the strangest things about the moon is something that we don't even give a second thought something called tidal lock frankly the scientific definition makes it sound very natural tidal lock is simply that the moon's rotation exactly matches its orbit in short this means against all natural laws the same side of the Moon always faces the planet and we're prevented from ever seeing the back half of our moon also known as the Dark Side of the Moon explore the universe with very few exceptions everything spins including earth whose rotations should be throwing the moon into a furious counter spin instead somehow our moon is literally like an all watching eye that never ceases surveillance of the planet to which it's bound another fact every astronomer knows it's a one in a trillion chance that a planets moon would appear exactly the same size as its Sun during an eclipse and by the way if you view of full Eclipse from space you'll see this look familiar then there's the fact that natural satellites circle their planets around the equator so why does our moon circle earth at a tendency of five degrees the exact distance elevation elliptical course and speed that enable it to transform life on Earth by creating tidal flow and seasons all the benefit to life here for sure so older bigger and lighter in mass than it should be according to the laws of physics our Moon shouldn't even be here we know that without the moon the Earth's orbital revolution would change it's said that we'd have an in steady gravitational pull which would make the planet wobble so if it's not a complete anomaly of random luck how did the moon get here could it have been put there to find out we need to know the truth about our history and not surprisingly the ancients may have given us the answer while you probably didn't get much education about this a multitude of cultures the world over refer to what is called the time before the moon the list of those who have written about this begins with many well-known ancient Greek writers and philosophers including Aristotle and Plutarch there's even reference to the time when there was no moon before the Cataclysm and certain inhabitants were known as pro celanese which means those that were before the moon but this expression was used elsewhere the Columbian legends say in the earliest times when the moon was not yet in the heavens in Africa the Zulu tribe tells the legend that the moon is an egg with its yolk removed brought here from far away by non terrestrial dragons who placed it into orbit their legend says the earth turned over when it was brought here causing cataclysms and a great flood nearly wiping out humanity could this legend coincide with our current understanding of history when humanity's population bottleneck reducing all races to a single ancestor the geneticists call mitochondrial Eve somewhere between 150 to 200 thousand years ago could ancient earth have experienced these cataclysms as a result of the arrival of this unnatural satellite would this explain why so many cultures without any connection to each other share the same story about our cosmic neighbor the idea the was brought here seems like a stretch he simply cannot fathom how but let's imagine for a moment that the inconceivable is true and that our seemingly natural moon was in fact brought here by a race with methods we've yet to comprehend why was it merely to create tides and seasons might it have anything to do with the humanoid race that was existing here could the answers be found in the other ancient historical writings of Earth history like the Sumerian tablets which indicate the arrival of an extraterrestrial race who genetically manipulated humans to serve as their slaves here on earth so there's something strange about the mass of the moon understanding that it's 25% or one-fourth of the Earth's nearly eight thousand mile diameter how is it possible that the mass of the moon is so much less than Earth only 1.2 percent of Earth when it should be the same ratio as the volume in 1970 after years of research two Russian scientists vasin and scherbakov published an article in Sputnik magazine titled is the moon creation by alien intelligence translated it theorized that the moon is an artificial Earth satellite put into orbit around the Earth by some intelligent beings unknown to ourselves based on the sheer logic of its perfect size and orientation they believed the moon was placed in the Earth's orbit ages ago and they're not alone in 2006 after decades of research two Brits Knight and Butler also published their research in a book titled who built the moon they pointed out that the absolute perfectly proportional geometry and the sequencing of integers for every aspect of the moon was duplicated by no other body in the solar system they also discussed the huge but ultra light mass in the end they created a very persuasive conclusion stating if higher life only developed on earth because the moon is exactly what it is and where it is it becomes irrational to cling to the idea it's a natural object they say the more likely possibility is the moon was brought here into our orbit and is most likely a hollowed-out planetoid in November of 1969 the Apollo 12 crew sent their lunar module crashing down onto the moon creating an artificial earthquake about 40 miles from their seismic devices the ultra sensitive equipment recorded the crash and found that the moon rang like a bell for almost 40 minutes taking almost eight minutes to reach its peak it was so stunning that NASA decided to try it with an even heavier rocket in their next mission so Apollo 13s module struck with the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT even though the seismic equipment was over 100 miles from the crash site according to NASA this the moon rang like a gong again reverberating for three full hours within the two kilometer radius of the landing the outcome of these experiments are so unpredictable and shocking most people simply refuse to entertain what they imply when you consider the perfect geometry and placement of the moon the shallow craters the unique man-made elements the locked orbit the hollow reverberation it becomes pretty obvious that there's a lot more to this story and the moon itself beneath the surface on November 23rd of 1966 images taken by a manned moon orbiter showed no less than six tall structures on the moon these images were published in The Washington Post and the LA Times with at least one Boeing scientist claiming they were far too geometric to be natural upon study Soviet space engineer Alexander Abramoff noted that the center of the spires are arranged precisely the same way as the apices of the three great pyramids in Egypt and they cast four perfect 90-degree angle shadows into an eroded pit area at NASA dr. Farouk Elbaz also claiming they could not be natural revealed they were taller than any building on earth NASA on the other hand declined to investigate saying it was a trick of light and shadow consequentially the subject was dropped from the media but years later several shots from Apollo 17 showed these same clear right-angled structures you may have noticed photographs of the moon are so unclear they look like they're from 1912 and are perfectly deceptive with regard to detail in fact sometimes it seems that photos of the distant planet Mars are clearer than those of the moon at least until 1994 photographer Jose Escamilla colorized photos taken from a moon orbiter 100 miles away the effect revealed these structural anomalies not otherwise visible in black and white so if structures do exist on the moon who built them and where are they now prior to the first moon landing Apollo 10 flew around the back of the moon and their transcripts reveal that they all heard what they called eerie outerspace music like nothing he'd ever heard before sounds which have since been compared to the electromagnetic radio like sounds recorded by Cassini from inside Saturn's rings NASA dismissed the noise as radio waves interacting with the magnetic field of the moon but the moon doesn't have a magnetic field like planets do so to the question what created this noise we have a new question why lie about it the first Apollo landing on the moon is one of the most triumphant events of late human history but after the structures were revealed NASA had to have prepared the astronauts to potentially meet something or someone during that trip there were two minutes of video and radio silence when the cameras and recording equipment were said to have simultaneously failed of course this equipment was the most highly advanced at the time and produced reliable recordings without a stitch for the rest of the mission years later close friends and relatives revealed what both Armstrong and Aldrin said had actually happened during those minutes on leaving the module Armstrong deliberately switched his communication to the medic line and said there are other spacecraft here sir lined up on the other side of the crater those babies are huge enormous they're watching us without full disclosure of classified information no one will ever know the real reason why the astronauts returned to Earth was such strange dispositions without any indication in their cold expressions of the excitement that one would expect from the first men ever to touch the surface of the Moon it became even more obvious that something was off when they were each interviewed separately he who can easily detect even without being a body language expert that something just isn't right perhaps the most curious point of all is the cryptic speech that Armstrong gave 25 years after the landing there are great ideas undiscovered breakthroughs available to those who can remove one of truths protective layers there are places to go beyond belief truths protective layers what where who is protecting us from the truth so if the moon is not solid mass but a hollow artificial satellite and there are structures there certainly there must be evidence of extraterrestrial life somewhere of course only astronauts would know for sure and not surprisingly you'll find that early on they were talking but have become less inclined to reveal their knowledge as the years have passed here are a few among many who have revealed what they know scott Carpenter of the orbiter mercury Atlas 7 said at no time when the astronauts were in space were they alone there was a constant surveillance by UFOs Buzz Aldrin years after his legendary landing for some reason became reclusive and said there's a monolith on the moon of Mars when people find out about that they'll say who put that there the first Japanese American in space Colonel lieutenant Onizuka went so far as to admit he witnessed small strange-looking creatures humanoid in shape they did not look of earthly origin and then the sixth astronaut to walk on the moon Edgar Mitchell admitted yes there has been et visitation and may continue to be there's a lot of evidence that points to a clandestine group what is the relationship of ET life to this clandestine group Mitchell named what are they withholding from the rest of us in the 1950s the physicist Enrico Fermi pointed out the strange contradiction about alien life he said that given the vastness of the universe there should be a high probability that other intelligent civilizations exist but he added there was a total lack of evidence anywhere on earth or in space considering all that's been shared however is his statement really true is there really no evidence or just no evidence that you can safely discuss publicly in fact given all the evidence we've listed can you step back far enough to see the forest through the trees what is more threatening testimonies of people who've experienced unexplainable phenomenon by today's common knowledge or might the real threat be that if you dare to share your story you could risk being ostracized from everything and everyone you know and love Carl Sagan said something very wise about human nature he recognized when new information challenges our beliefs it threatens our sense of self and triggers our primal reptilian brain Sagan long warned humanity about this saying when our illusions about ourselves are challenged some of us may tend to fly into murderous rages so let's consider what the real threat is the new information or our own response to it we want to believe that if there was any validity to this artificial moon concept certainly the scientific community would be exploring it right of course information as important as extraterrestrial life would never be withheld from public knowledge or would it according to NASA Brookings report a 1960s discussion of space exploration public disclosure of et life would quote caused the collapse of society and must therefore remain clandestine and there's that word again clandestine astronaut Edgar Mitchell 'he's description for the hoarders of truth the evidence is all around you dare to explore dare to discuss for until the day disclosure begins it's safe to say Neil Armstrong's statement may have been slightly off rather than one small step for man one giant leap for mankind it might have been one small step for man one giant deception for mankind
moonlanding,"Now, for the first time, you will hear the truth about our Moon - a truth beyond our wildest imaginings. The fact that it rung like a bell after an impact event suggests the moon is actually hollow, as well as the fact that moon rocks returned dates it at 20 Billion years old! older than our own solar system. So where does it come from...?? The moon is both perfect in shape and elliptical orbit, with craters that while vastly wide are only a fraction of the depth they should be - that is unless you observe that the moon is indeed a hard outer shield with a protected and possibly interior. When you find out what is inside our satellite you will find out why this is the  the biggest secret in history.",What's Inside the Moon Documentary Most Shocking Secret Ever Discovered,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXjdGI33qrE,0,1295591,8143,1427,3322,YXjdGI33qrE,"despite six announced visits by US astronauts between 1969 and 1972 the moon remains a riddle to scientists in many regards these solutions to these riddles could indicate an alien aspect of our familiar moon called the rosetta stone of the planets by dr. Robert Jastrow the first chairman of NASA's lunar exploration committee scientists did hope by studying the composition of the moon to resolve some of the mysteries of how our planet and solar system came into existence step on the moon by astronaut Neil Armstrong was said to be one small step for man one giant leap for mankind but for many of the 12 men who have been there that one small step completely changed the way they saw the world some returned feeling as if they'd experienced enlightenment others spent the years following their unit exploration depressed and hiding from the press some say that those quiet astronauts saw things the others hadn't secret things that they were asked to cover up after stepping on the moon Buzz Aldrin's life fell apart he went into a deep depression his marriage of 21 years ended he remarried and was divorced again within two years he became an alcoholic within a few years the former astronaut found himself selling used cars to make a living when approached by the press he seemed agitated and reluctant to share details of his mission Neil Armstrong the first man on the moon is said to have been reclusive and possibly withdrawn he also frustrated interviewers with his refusal zat extremely private nature many people have wondered why they would struggle after such an achievement I think we were timely and accepting this mission of going to the moon it might be timely at this point to thank you many other areas of other missions that could be accomplished some believe it was because the entire moon landing was a hoax some think they saw proof of alien life but it was kept quiet buzz did say in one interview that he observed a light moving alongside the ship others think that buzz was just jealous at being the second man on the moon and Neil had always been quiet we may never know because NASA erased the original moon landing footage whatever caused their depression the truth is that there are many oddities about the moon it's been a source of fascination since the dawn of humanity many ancient peoples worshipped it as a god or told legends about it the Zulu tribe of Africa for example tells of two alien brothers who toed the moon into place and gave us the rhythms of the earth even today its mysteries tantalize our minds for example the moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun and 400 times closer to the earth because of this mysterious coincidence moon passes in front of the Sun during an eclipse the moon completely blocks the much bigger Sun yet scientists say that if the moon were not as it is life may not have evolved past the sea the moon affects the tides and the tides made it possible for some sea creatures to reach land where they eventually evolved into land animals science writer Earle Yubel declared the lunar rosetta stone remains a mystery the moon is more complicated than anyone expected it's not simply a kind of billiard ball frozen in space and time as many scientists have believed few of the fundamental questions have been answered but the Apollo rocks and recordings have spawned a score of mysteries in the pictures we showed earlier you saw rocks and the boulder field out Buzz's window that were three and four feet in size very likely pieces of the lunar bedrock and it would have been very interesting to go over and and get some samples of those among those breath stopping mysteries or anomalies as scientists prefer to call them is the fact that the moon is far older than previously imagined perhaps even much older than the Earth and Sun by examining tracks burned into moon rocks by cosmic rays scientists have dated them as billions of years old some have even dated back 4.5 billion years far older than the earth and nearly as old as the solar system the moon has at least three distinct layers of rocks contrary to the idea that heavier objects sink the moon rocks are found on the surface and there is definite disparity in the distribution of minerals Yubel asked if the earth and moon were created at the same time near each other why is one body got all the iron the earth and the other the not much asked Yubel the differences suggest that earth and moon came into being far from each other an idea that stumbles over the inability of astrophysicists to explain how exactly the moon became a satellite of the earth the moon is extremely dry and does not appear to have ever had water in any substantial amounts none of the moon rocks regardless of where they were found contained free water or even water molecules bound into the minerals yet Apollo 16 astronauts found moon rocks that contain bits of rusted iron since oxidation requires oxygen and free hydrogen this rust indicates that there must be water somewhere on the moon furthermore instruments left behind by Apollo missions sent a signal to earth on March 7 1971 indicating a wind of water had crossed the moon's surface when you would not be there your foot and against something you would tend to shed the outer surface of this material but there remained considerable smudges I don't know how that got on the knees since any water on the airless moon surface vaporizes and behaves like wind on earth the question became where did this water originate the vapor cloud eruptions lasted 14 hours and covered an area of some 100 square miles prompting Rice University physicist dr. John Freeman Jr and dr. H Ken Hills to pronounce the event one of the most exciting discoveries yet indicating water within the moon the two physicists claimed the water vapor came from deep inside the moon apparently released during a moonquake NASA officials offered a more mundane and questionable explanation they speculated that two tanks on Apollo descent stages contained between 60 and 100 pounds of water became stressed and ruptured releasing their contents Freeman and Hill's declined to accept this explanation pointing out that the two tanks from Apollo 12 and 14 were some 180 kilometers apart yet the water vapor was detected with the same flux at both sites although the instruments faced in opposite directions skeptics also have understandably questioned the odds of two separate tanks breaking simultaneously and how such a small quantity of water could produce 100 square miles of vapor moon rocks were found to be magnetized not strong enough to pick up a paper clip but magnetic nonetheless however there is no magnetic field on the moon itself where did the magnetism come from the presence of Maria or large seas of smooth sulphide molten rock also presented a mystery these Maria indicate nothing less than a vast outpouring of llama at some distant time it's now been confirmed that some of the moon's craters are of internal origin yet there's no indication that the moon has ever been hot enough to produce volcanic eruptions another puzzle is that almost all four-fifths of the Morea are located on the moon's earth side hemisphere whew Maria marked the far side of the moon often erroneously referred to as the dark side yet the far side contains many more craters and mountainous areas you see most of the craters have rounded edges however there is a variation in the in the age of these as we can tell by the sharpness of the edge of the crater in comparison to the rest of the moon the Maria are relatively free of craters suggesting that craters were covered by lava flow adding to this mystery are the mass Khan's large dense circular masses lying twenty to forty miles below the center of the moon's Maria the mass Khan's were discovered because their denseness distorted the orbits of our spacecraft flying over or near them one scientist proposed that the mass Khan's are heavy iron meteorites that plunge deep into the moon while it was in a soft formable stage this theory has been discounted since meteorites strike with such velocity they would vaporize on contact another mundane explanation is that the mass cons are nothing more than lava filled caverns but skeptics say there isn't enough lava present to accomplish this it would seem these mass cons are huge disc shaped objects possibly of artificial construction it's unlikely that large circular discs located directly under the center of the Maria like a giant bullseye happened by accident or coincidence between 1969 and 1977 Apollo mission seismographic equipment registered up to 3000 moon quakes each year of operation most of the vibrations were quite small and were caused by meteorite strikes or falling booster rockets but many other quakes were detected deep inside the moon this internal creaking is believed to be caused by the gravitational pull of our planet as most moon quakes occur when the moon is closest to the earth an event occurred in 1958 in the moon's Alphonsus crater which shook the idea that all internal moon quake activity was simply settling rocks in November of that year Soviet astronomer Nikolai a Koza Rev of the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory startled the scientific world by photographing the first recorded gaseous eruption on the moon near the craters Peak Kozar have attributed this to escaping fluorescent gases he also detected a reddish glow characteristic of carbon compounds which seemed to move and disappear after an hour some scientists refused to accept kozyrev's findings until astronomers at the Lowell University also saw reddish glows on the crest of ridges at the Aristarchus region in 1960 three days later colored lights on the moon lasting more than an hour were reported at two separate observatories something was going on inside the volcanic Li dead moon and whatever it is it occurs the same way at the same time as the moon moves closer to the earth seismic signals from different stations on the lunar surface detect identical vibrations it's difficult to accept this movement as a natural phenomenon for example a broken artificial hull plate could shift exactly the same way each time the moon passed near the earth there's evidence to indicate the moon may be Hollow studies of moon rocks indicate that the moon's interior differs from the Earth's mantle in ways suggesting a very small or even non-existent core as far back as 1962 NASA scientist dr. Gordon McDonald stated if the astronomical data are reduced it's found that the data require that the interior of the moon be less dense than the outer parts indeed it would seem that the moon is more like a hollow than a homogeneous sphere Apollo 14 astronaut dr. Edgar Mitchell while scoffing at the possibility of a hollow moon nevertheless admitted that since heavier materials were on the surface it's quite possible that giant caverns exist within the moon you cannot always tell this by looking at the terrain what the exact resistance will be as your foot sinks into a point of firm contact so one must be quite cautious and moving around in this rough terrain the footprint would penetrate perhaps a half an inch or sometimes only a quarter of an inch and gave a very firm response in other regions near the edges of these craters we could find that the foot would would sink down maybe to three possibly four inches mi t--'s dr. Sean C Solomon wrote the lunar orbiter experiments vastly improved our knowledge of the moon's gravitational field indicating the frightening possibility that the moon might be Hollow why frightening the significance was stated by astronomer Carl Sagan way back in his 1966 work intelligent life in the universe a natural satellite cannot be a hollow object the most startling evidence that the moon could be hollow came on November 20th 1969 when the Apollo 12 crew after returning to their command ship sent the lunar module LM ascent stage crashing back onto the moon creating an artificial moon quake the LM struck the surface about 40 miles from the Apollo 12 landing site where ultra sensitive seismic equipment recorded something both unexpected and astounding the moon reverberating like a bowel for more than an hour the vibration wave took almost eight minutes to reach a peak and then decreased in intensity at a news conference that day one of the co-directors of the seismic experiment Maurice Ewing told reporters that scientists were at a loss to explain the ringing as for the meaning of it I'd rather not make an interpretation right now but it's as though someone has struck a bell in the belfry of a church a single blow that found the reverberation from it continued for 30 minutes it was later established that small vibrations had continued on the moon for more than an hour the phenomenon was repeated when the Apollo 13s third stage was sent crashing onto the moon by radio command striking with the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT according to NASA this time the moon reacted like a gong although seismic equipment was more than 108 miles from the crash site recording showed reverberations lasted for three hours and 20 minutes and traveled to a depth of 22 to 25 miles subsequent studies of man-made crashes on the moon yielded similar results after one impact the moon reverberate for four hours this ringing coupled with the density problem on the moon reinforces the idea of a hollow moon scientists hoped to record the impact of a meteor large enough to send shockwaves to the moon's core and back to settle the issue that opportunity came on May 13th 1972 when a large meteor struck the moon with the equivalent force of 200 tons of TNT after sending shockwaves deep into the interior the moon scientists were baffled to find that none returned confirming that there's something unusual about the moon's core or lack thereof dr. Farouk Elbaz was quoted as saying there are many undiscovered caverns suspected to exist beneath the surface of the Moon several experiments have been flown to the moon to see if there were actually such caverns the results of these experiments have not been made public it seems apparent that the moon has a tough hard outer shell and a light or non-existent interior the moon shell contains dense minerals such as titanium used on earth and the construction of aircraft and space vehicles many people still recall watching our astronauts on TV as they mainly tried to drill through the crust of a moon Maria their specially designed drills could only penetrate a few inches the puzzle of the moon's hard surface was compounded by the discovery of what appeared to be processed metals experts were surprised to find lunar rocks bearing brass mica and amphibole in addition to the near pure titanium uranium 236 and neptunium 237 elements not previously found in nature were discovered in moon rocks according to Argonne National Laboratory while still trying to explain the presence of these materials scientists were further startled to learn of rust-proof iron particles in a soil sample from the sea of crisis in 1976 The Associated Press reported that the Soviets had announced the discovery of iron particles that do not rust and samples brought back by unmanned moon mission in 1970 iron that doesn't rust is unknown in nature and well beyond present earth technology undoubtedly the greatest mystery concerning our Moon is how it came to be there in the first place prior to the Apollo missions one serious theory as to the Earth's origin was that it broke off the earth eons ago although no one could positively locate where on earth that originated many speculated the loss of material explain the huge gouge in the earth which forms the Pacific Ocean however this idea was discarded when it was found that there's little similarity between the composition of our world and the moon a more recent theory had the moon created out of space debris left over from the creation of the earth this concept proved untenable in light of current gravitational theory which indicates that one large object will accumulate all loose material leaving none for the formation of another large body it's now generally accepted that the moon originated elsewhere and entered the Earth's gravitational field at some point in the distant past here theories diverge one stating that the moon was originally a planet which collided with the earth creating debris which combined forming the moon well in other states that the moon while wandering through our solar system was captured and pulled into orbit by Earth's gravity neither of these theories are especially compelling because of the lack of evidence that neither the earth nor the moon seemed to have been physically disrupted by a past close encounter there's no debris in space indicating a past collision and it's not appear that the Earth and Moon developed during the same time period as for the capture Theory even scientist Isaac Asimov well known for his works of fiction has written it's too big to have been captured by the earth the chances of such a capture having been affected and the moon then having taken up nearly circular orbit around our earth are too small to make such an eventuality credible Asimov was right to consider the moon's orbit it's not only near a perfect circle but stationary one side always faces the earth with only the slightest variation as far as we know it's the only natural satellite with such an orbit this circular orbit is especially odd considering that the moon's center of mass lies more than a mile closer to the earth than its geometric centre this fact alone should produce an unstable wobbly orbit much is a ball with its mass off-center will not roll in a straight line additionally almost all of the other satellites in our solar system orbit in the plane of their planets equator not so the moon whose orbit lies strangely near the Earth's orbit around the Sun or inclined to the Earth's elliptical by more than five degrees add to this the fact that the moon's bulge located on the side facing away from Earth thus negating the idea that it was caused by Earth's gravitational pull makes for an off-balance twirled in 1961 President Kennedy boldly declared before a joint session of Congress that the United States would send a man to the moon and return him safely to the earth within a decade I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long-range exploration of space during the initial time period after touchdown we went through various sequences to prepare us for immediate abort it seems impossible that such an oddity could naturally fall into such a precise and circular orbit it's a fascinating conundrum as articulated by science writer William Roy Shelton who wrote it is important to remember that something had to put the moon at or near its present circular pattern around the earth just as a base craft circling the earth every 90 minutes while 100 miles high has to have a velocity of roughly 18,000 miles per hour to stay in orbit so something had to give the moon precisely required velocity for its weight and altitude the point and it's one seldom noted and considering the origin of the moon is that it's extremely unlikely that any object would just stumble into the right combination of factors required to stay in orbit something had to put the moon at its altitude on its course and at its speed the question is what was that something if the precise and stationary orbit of the moon is seen as sheer coincidence it's also coincidence that the moon is at just the right distance from the earth to completely cover the Sun during an eclipse while the diameter of the moon is a mere 2160 miles against the sun's gigantic 864,000 miles it is nevertheless in just the proper position to block out all but the sun's flaming Corona when it moves between the Sun and the earth Asimov explained there's no astronomical reason why the Moon and Sun should fit so well it is the sheerest of coincidences and only the earth among all the planets is blessed in this fashion is it mere coincidence how does one explain this and many other moon mysteries in July 1972 Russian scientist Michael vasin and Alexander scherbakov published an article in the Soviet journal Sputnik entitled is the moon the creation of alien intelligence they advanced the theory that the moon is not a completely natural world but a planetoid that was hollowed out eons ago in the far reaches of space by intelligent beings possessing a technology far superior to ours huge machines were used to melt rock and form large cavities within the moon spewing the molten refuse onto the surface protected by a hull like inner shell plus a reconstructed outer shell of metallic rocky junk this gigantic craft was steered through the cosmos and finally parked in orbit around the earth in their article vasan and scherbakov wrote abandoning the traditional paths of common sense we've lunged into what may at first seem to be unbridled and irresponsible fantasy but the more minutely we go into all the information gathered by man about the moon the more we're convinced that there's not a single fact to rule out this supposition not only that but many things so far consider to be lunar enigmas are explainable in the light of this new hypothesis outrageous as the spaceship Moon Theory might first appear consider how this model reconciles all the mysteries of the moon it would explain why the moon gives evidence of being much older than the earth and perhaps even our solar system and why there are three distinct layers within the moon with the densest materials on the outside layer exactly as one would expect of the hull of a spacecraft it could also explain why no signs of water has been found on the moon's surface yet there's evidence it exists deep inside this theory also would explain these strange Maria and mass cons perhaps the remnants of the machinery used to hollow out the moon the idea of an artificial satellite could explain the odd rhythmic moon quakes as artificial constructs reacting the same way during periods of stress from the earth spall and artificial equipment beneath the moon's surface might be the source of the gas clouds that have been observed intelligent terraforming of the moon could prove the solution to the argument between hot moon and cold moon scientists they're both right the moon originally was a cold world which was transformed into a spacecraft by artificially heating or expelling vast quantities of its interior this theory could also explain these seeming contradictions over the question of a hollow moon if the moon originally were a solid world which was artificially hollowed out there would be evidence of both phases exactly what we have with the current moon knowledge an artificially hollowed-out moon would explain why the satellite rings like a bell for hours after being struck and my specimens of tough refractory metals such as titanium chromium and zirconium rust-proof iron uranium 236 and neptunium 237 have been found there in fact the spaceship Moon Theory may come closer to any other and reconciling the questions over the origin and amazing orbit of the moon but we're not supposed to consider this thesis the circular logic of modern science regarding the origins of the moon run something like this we know that extraterrestrials don't exist but we do know that the moon exists and has been mentioned throughout human history we humans did not create or place it in Earth's orbit so must have been done by extraterrestrials but since we know they don't exist we'll simply call it an anomaly and will not publicly say anything more about this is there an alien base on the moon more and more people are coming forward with stories of an alien presence on the moon rumors are that their moon base is on the dark side of the Moon the side we never see from Earth did you ever wonder why the moon landing stopped and why we've not tried to build a moon base I understand that some believe that we should attempt a return to the surface of the Moon first as previously planned but I just have to say pretty bluntly here we've been there before it seems a better and easier idea than a floating Space Station according to Neil Armstrong the aliens have a base on the moon and wanted us to get off and stay off the moon Milton Cooper a naval intelligence officer tells us that the intelligence community calls the alien base Luna Luna the alien base on the far side of the Moon it was seen and filmed by the Apollo astronauts a base a mining operation using very large machines and the very large alien crafts described in sightings reports as mother ships exist there Milton Cooper did Apollo 11 encounter UFOs on the moon from the book above top secret by Timothy good according to Heather two unconfirmed reports both Neil Armstrong and Edwin Buzz Aldrin saw UFOs shortly after that historic landing on the moon in Apollo 11 on the 21st of July 1969 I remember hearing one of the astronauts referred to a light in or on a crater during the television transmission followed by a request from Mission Control for further information nothing more was heard according to a former NASA employee Otto bender unnamed radio hams with their own VHF receiving facilities that bypassed NASA's broadcasting outlets picked up the following exchange NASA what's their mission control calling Apollo 11 Apollo 11 these babies are huge sir enormous oh my god you wouldn't believe it I'm telling you there are other spacecraft out there lined up on the far side of the crater edge they're on the moon watching us in 1979 Maurice Shannon former chief of NASA communication system confirmed that Armstrong had indeed reported seeing two UFOs on the rim of a crater the encounter was common knowledge in NASA he revealed but nobody's talked about it until now Soviet scientists were allegedly the first to confirm the incident according to our information the encounter was reported immediately after the landing of the module said dr. Vladimir as Aza a physicist and professor of mathematics at Moscow University Neil Armstrong relayed the message to Mission Control that chiu large mysterious objects were watching them after having landed near the moon module but this message was never heard by the public because NASA censored it according to another Soviet scientist dr. Alexander Kazan says Buzz Aldrin took color movie film of the UFOs from inside the module and continued filming them after he and Armstrong went outside dr. Azazel claims that the UFOs departed minutes after the astronauts came out to the lunar surface Maurice Shadowland also confirmed that Apollo 11s radio transmissions were interrupted on several occasions in order to hide the news from the public before dismissing Shadowland sensational claims it's worth noting his impressive background in the aerospace industry and space program his first job after moving from France was as some electronics engineer with convair specializing in telecommunications telemetry and radar in 1959 he was in charge of an electromagnetic research group developing new radar and telecommunication systems for Ryan one of his 11 patents was an automatic radar landing system that ignited retro rockets at a given altitude used in the Ranger and surveyor flights to the moon later at North American Aviation Channel and was offered the job of designing and building the Apollo communications and data processing systems channeling claims that all Apollo and Gemini flights were followed both at a distance and sometimes also quite closely by space vehicles of extraterrestrial origin flying saucers or UFOs if you want to call them that every time it occurred the astronauts inform Mission Control who then ordered absolute silence he goes on to say I think that Walter schirra aboard mercury 8 was the first of the astronauts to use the codename Santa Claus to indicate the presence of flying saucers next to space capsules however his announcements were barely noticed by the general public it was a little different when James Lovell onboard the Apollo 8 command module came out from behind the moon and said for everybody to hear please be informed that there is santa claus even though this happened on christmas day 1968 many people sensed a hidden meaning in those words rumors persist nasa may well be a civilian agency but many of its programs are funded by the defense budget and most of the astronauts are subject to military security regulations apart from the fact that the National Security Agency screens all films and probably radio communications as well we have the statements by Otto bender dr. Gary Henderson and Maurice channeland that the astronauts were under strict orders not to discuss their sightings and Gordon Cooper has testified to the United Nations committee that one of the astronauts actually witnessed a UFO on the ground if there's no secrecy why is the sighting not been made public a certain professor who wished to remain anonymous was engaged in a discussion with Neil Armstrong during a NASA symposium professor what really happened out there with Apollo 11 Armstrong it was incredible of course we had always known there was a possibility the fact is we were warned off there was never any question then of a space station or a moon city professor how do you mean warned off Armstrong I can't go into details except to say that their ships were far superior to ours both in size and technology boy were they big and menacing no there's no question of a space station professor but NASA had other missions after Apollo 11 Armstrong naturally NASA was committed at that time and couldn't risk panic on earth but it really was a quick scoop and back again Armstrong confirmed that the story was true but refused to go into further detail beyond admitting that the CIA was behind the cover-up how much do we really know about this mysterious orb after much scientific study many questions still remain unanswered you"

#let_me_know #Space",The Truth Behind Why The First Footprints On The Moon Don’t Match Neil Armstrong’s Boots,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmzSQJ42G94,-1,1817194,13098,3405,8076,BmzSQJ42G94,it's July 1969 and the world watches as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin take mankind's first steps onto the moon fast-forward to 2018 however and the internet is rife with conspiracy theories that claim the event was staged what's more such doubts are unlikely to die after an Internet user spotted something strange about Armstrong's boots but is the observation really evidence of arguably the boldest hoax in history Apollo 11 launched from Florida's Kennedy Space Center on July 16th of that momentous year it took with it of course all the hopes of America desperate to beat the Soviet Union in the race to land a man on the moon and four days later the country celebrated as Armstrong and Aldrin aided by fellow astronaut Michael Collins stepped onto the lunar surface America's mission was a success the astronauts subsequently explored the surface of the Moon capturing images and taking samples of the lunar terrain then after hoisting the American flag the men began their perilous journey back to earth thankfully then on July 24th the missions command module landed safely in the Pacific Ocean and the event subsequently catapulted Armstrong and Aldrin to fame but just seven years after Apollo 11s trailblazing flight some people already began to express doubts surrounding the events of July 1969 skeptics moreover believed that NASA's great success story was nothing more than an elaborate hoax in 1976 bill kaysing published we never went to the moon America's thirty billion dollar swindle and in it he questioned whether the landings had actually taken place until 1963 the writer had worked for the propulsion field laboratories head of technical publications at rocket time this was the company responsible for manufacturing engines used in the Apollo 11 launch according to casing the probability of completing a successful moon landing is impossibly low he theorized then that NASA had faked the landings partly in order to convince the Soviet Union of its superiority the author's credentials have been called into question mind you yet his book sparked a new breed of conspiracy theories that / main popular to this day over the years many have expressed doubts and presented theories concerning armstrong and aldrin strip to the moon and in 1980 the Flat Earth Society put forth a particularly interesting take the group claimed that NASA had staged the landings in a Hollywood studio with the famous director Stanley Kubrick at the home and surprisingly perhaps such theories have endured over the decades a 1999 survey revealed that an estimated 6 percent of Americans believe the moon landings were a hoax as for suggested motivations they range from a desire to be seen to have won the space race - contemporaneous efforts to draw attention away from the Vietnam War but is there really any evidence to prove such theories well perhaps unexpectedly there are a number of anomalies that skeptics point to in order to support their claims for example why does footage taken from the missions show an American flag blowing in what seems to be wind when there's no such weather pattern on the moon by the same token why were shadows from the astronauts and their equipment cast in different directions and photographs from the mission is this evidence that the landing was filmed in a studio with the effect caused by artificial illumination and separately who filmed the astronauts blasting off the moon back into space these anomalies are though relatively easy to explain away for example experts claim that the flag used on the moon was mounted on a horizontal rod thereby giving it the appearance of having caught in the wind furthermore the lack of air resistance in the lunar atmosphere meant that the fabric would have taken a while to settle once moved shadows meanwhile can be made to appear warp by uneven surfaces and other conditions which in turn could explain why some images of the landings seemed to show a strange lighting effect and as for the photographs of the men leaving the moon the answer is perhaps the most prosaic of all they could have been snapped by remote cameras that have been left behind when the astronauts returned to their ship in fact most conspiracy theories about the moon landings could be easily explained away and yet there's one claim discovered by fact-checking website Snopes in August 2016 that many have taken at face value apparently one eagle-eyed observer noticed something strange about Neil Armstrong's boots in 2015 Phil Plait an astronomer based in Boulder Colorado snapped a shot of the spacesuit worn by Armstrong on his mission to the moon the garment was being preserved at the National Air and Space Museum at the time but when plate posted the photographs to his Flickr account one individual quickly pointed out and apparently glaring anomaly why does the tread on this boot differ from the famous footprint photo in the dust on the moon's surface they wrote at at first glance they appeared to have an excellent point in plates photograph the boots of Armstrong spacesuit can be clearly seen and they definitely don't match up with the deep tread marks of the prints and stamps and the moon landings but is this evidence of fakery on a huge scale the answer is that it's not and the discrepancy can be easily explained according to Snopes the footprint from the famous moon landing photographs doesn't even belong to Armstrong note the image was captured by Aldrin who snapped his own print to document the surfaces tensile strength and an image shot by Armstrong as his colleague exited the lunar module backs up the claim Aldrin is clearly shown wearing boots that match the imprint left behind still not even this explanation is really needed to dispel any conspiratorial claims as can be seen in images of Armstrong that were snapped during the moon landings his own boots also match the prints shown in the photograph you see apparently both astronauts wore pairs of over shoes complete with the distinctive soles for extra protection after asserting all the facts relating to this claim then Snopes has labeled the Boots theory as false however this hasn't stopped the story from being repeated across the Internet even if it frequently comes with an amendment that acknowledges the truth Armstrong space suit is today still undergoing conservation work at the National Air and Space Museum meanwhile despite plenty of evidence to the contrary the idea of the moon landing hoax remains one of the world's most popular conspiracy theories and in our current post truth era this seems unlikely to change any time soon you you you

President Moon Jae-in is in Malaysia,… the second leg of his three-stop ASEAN tour.
After having wrapped his visit to Brunei that focused much on energy and infrastructure cooperation,… the South Korean leader is eyeing high-tech and Halal industry.
Shin Se-min files this report from Kuala Lumpur.  
President Moon's first day in Malaysia started with an effort to build ties between the countries in Hallyu -- or the Korean Wave -- and the Halal industry. 
Attending an exhibition in the heart of the Malaysian capital,... the president said the driving force bringing the two countries together is the the Korean Wave of entertainment spreading across the world.
""If Korea and Malaysia work together and jointly enter the market, it will become a new model of economic cooperation.""
The president said that by integrating Malaysia as a leading hub for Halal, and Korea's own culture of Hallyu, the two can create a synergy that spans the world.
The value of the international halal market currently stands at over 2-trillion U.S. dollars, and its expected to grow by another trillion or more by the year 2022.
The South Korean leader's tour of ASEAN nations is partly meant to boost his country's ties with the region under the administration's New Southern Policy, which also targets India.
It also comes ahead of anniversary next year in which Korea and ASEAN will celebrate 60 years of diplomatic relations.

""The president wants to boost ties with Malaysia even further so that they flourish in the fast-changing field of technology,… while also helping Korea enter the Halal market, which includes a quarter of the world’s population.

moonlanding,"5 Aliens Life Forms on Moon and Mars  Caught By NASA

5. Alien structures found on Moon
Ufologists have found traces extraterrestrial civilizations on the Moon. New satellite images, allegedly taken by an orbital probe that has been orbiting the Earth's natural satellite for seven years, showed strange objects on the surface of the Moon.
""UFO catchers"" studied the photos and found strange-looking ""formations"" on the Moon. Ufologists believe that the images captured the wreckage of an alien ship that crashed on the Moon. The researchers could also see a chain of footprints that lead to the mysterious object.

4. Alien Image found in the image of Nasa 
These images, were taken from the NASA Curiosity Rover droid which is scouring the surface for signs of life - but appeared to have missed it, if the alien chasers are to be believed. In this image a head, torso and legs can clearly be distinguished.""
Everything is there in the original image, whatever it is it looks humanoid, reminds me of the Atacama Alien, about the same size too, this one is around 6 inches.""

3. Aliens may have sent a strong signal from sun like star
Astronomers engaged in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) are training their instruments on a star around 94 light years from Earth after a very strong signal was detected by a Russian telescope.
An international team of researchers is now examining the radio signal and its star, HD 164595 -- described in a paper by Italian astronomer Claudio Maccone and others as a ""strong candidate for SETI"" -- in the hopes of determining its origin.
""The signal from HD 164595 is intriguing, because it comes from the vicinity of a sun-like star, and if it's artificial, its strength is great enough that it was clearly made by a civilization with capabilities beyond those of humankind,"" astronomer Douglas Vakoch, president of METI International, which searches for life beyond Earth, tells CNN. Whenever a strong signal is detected, ""it's a good possibility for some nearby civilization to be detected,"" Maccone tells CNN.

2. Alien skeleton found on mars
A new image beamed back by the Curiosity rover is ultimate proof that the red planet had life in the distant past. new images show what appear to be fossilized remains of an Alien” creature on Mars.
Looking at the image I have to say they look a bit strange, but, does strange mean Alien? Well… lets not jump to conclusions.
""The relic has a large skull adorned with an ornate or decorative head piece, this could indicate that its the remains of a king, religious icon or perhaps a fallen warrior,""

1. Alien Antenna found on Moon surface

Mark Sawalha, a UFO hunter based in Finland, spotted a 'strange spike' in a Nasa photo of the lunar surface. He claims is an alien antenna that could be located on the roof of an alien base. 
'Aliens are using moon minerals and they have bases there too. Many other findings support this theory,' Mr Sawalha he told the Sun.

While he does not spell out what these findings are, the UFO spotter claims that Nasa knows about them and has chosen not to publish them.
He also speculates that the presence of aliens on the lunar surface may be the reason that Nasa hasn't sent any manned spacecraft to Earth's satellite since the Apollo missions.
The images, captured by the space agency's Lunar Orbiter, appear to show a small dark 'spike' that casts a shadow. Along with a mysterious antenna-like spike, zooming in on the photo also appears to reveal a 'clear plateau' under the antenna.

be beer is e life in his are a snails I might be saying your name the goddamn moon science and this goddamn boogie flight boss boogie so MJ endless top oh we gonna get Leah already know how he's starting its own anything we're gonna start off ride this we're gonna break down with the moon represents period to you your moon Sun the moon within the elements each moon houses where your movers on there where your moon like to feel comfortable at yeah we're gonna talk about all that motherly love energy and this goddamn Barry he shot the wreck well the Alpha Records L judo you know doing the you know the show shut out that it's miss lady here like Miss ice to call the girls miss lady high school goddess SS energy okay we forget Linda's mother about the moon in general so let's talk about the move real quick so for the most part this with the moon represent the moon is your first latest cloth that you create for yourself so your moon is your feminine now look you got a bunch of feminine shapes and forms you got testosterone will be your masculine people in your body and you got your estrogens what is your feminine your feminine vehicles in your body you know I'm saying they all got versions of alphas and omegas which is alpha it will be the largest scale of them and the Omega will be the smaller scale of them and all of them work as organisms to that in mind now once we get to your light bodies because those are light bodies also but more dense more heavy more bubbles more you know I'm saying being able to sustain yourself to certain astral travels but the ones that created those was was your light bodies so your light bodies you have you have masculine and feminine light bodies also so your feminine and masculine light bodies is what we will call like the moon mercury mercury will be masculine the moon will be feminine you should have said Mars will be masculine Venus will be feminine you said I'm saying your son your solar plexus that would be masculine you're a moon that would be your feminine you should have said you see you see I'll be nectar will be effeminate your Uranus will be your masculine you know say like that in and out in and out in and out but that's another video but for the most part you need to know as far as your light bodies you have masculine and feminine light bodies you create it for yourself also so even in your religion goddammit somebody had a son or somebody had a daughter some men now you know how I had a daughter I had a son too you don't say even if you ain't had no goddamn kids your newborn had a goddamn son and had a daughter of men also you need to know that you can have a fresh newborn just by that being been here daughters of men for themselves they created a feminine version for themselves and a masculine version for themselves therefore they got it appearance and they got a subconscious nature what makes them feel comfortable now what actually came first was your feminine vehicle and here's how we can kind of display that here because we enter a reality of receiving first we in Remer reality of reacting first we enter REM a reality of responding first so that read that's receiving so that's more attached to the feminine energy than the masculine energy then the pushing out energy so since that energy is more powerful here then you need to take into the consideration that the feminine energy was one of the was one of the first shapes and forms that we created out of it first so we nine times out of ten created our markaba or moon first before we created our solar plexus to be aware of ourselves and to have our center anchor and for other people to be aware of us at our Center you see them saying in our state of being you said I'm saying so keep this in mind your moon is gonna be more important because your moon is gonna motivate your Sun without you understanding that first light cloth to be like this is what I'm comfortable with you wouldn't even get up and be motivated to act on that to make other people pay attention to what makes you feel comfortable or not or would you react and respond to or not and once you start to do that once you start to act on the things that make you feel comfortable once you start to act on what you're reacting nine times out of 10 that's when your solar plexus is active but goddamn it the first thing that you tapped into what's your move would you resonate it with what made you feel comfortable and your ability to react in and respond to the world that you are in before you show your ego before you show your life before you show what you know all you won't do first is receive and experience first so that always taps you into your moon first so that's the goddamn moon god damn it let me take a look take a hit of this goddamn lemon juice so the moon is who you are your moon is you you need to know that the moon is who you are the moon is you now your move motivates your son so your move motivates your actions thank you so much for the donation visit James anytime you in a situation where you want to feel comfortable or you're reacting and responding and you in need to feel comfortable or you're starting to feel uncomfortable you're going to utilize your son in order to get that done but what actually makes you feel comfortable is the world that your moon is in so the moon your moon sign is who you are your Sun Sign is how the moon's going to look your Sun Sign is how you actually participate in that energy and your ascendant is how is how you're personally endorsing it I don't know no other word and act because the Sun is your actions but the Sun in that Cinda is like taught to the same kind of course because for you to have an ascendant that means that's where this that's the space that your son was in so they're related your son is your son it's it's you it's how you look but the appearance of how you look is the area that is that you see them saying is the acidity so that's how your son appears the beat but when we see it in action is going to be your son sign but how it looks when it's in action that's your ass in dishonor y'all saying so best way I can put this an example right my moon sign is sad that's what motivates me you said him say that's what makes me feel comfortable now how I push that out in the world it's Aries so that's how the sad look Sagittarius look like my sunshine my sunshine is Aries now how the personality throughout it I'm characterizing it my character my appearance throughout it is my sending which is real so I'm a Sagittarius that act like it Aries that looks like a Leo you get it so your moon is who you are but the only way you can express your moon is through your son so your son moon and ascended all of these is truly who you are and what people see is your sunshine but what people don't know behind closed doors what makes you feel comfortable but should you resonate with the only things that people know if they knew you and there was around you a lot to see what you're manifested and what makes you feel comfortable that becomes your move so that's more you a lot of times people use their son as an ego especially when they got debilitated sons like when you got a uh or when you got a son that don't align well with your moon so if you got a moon that's opposing or squaring or in conjunct in your son then a lot of times these people utilize their son at to hide things or they utilized a son as an ego to not show their internal hurt or they utilized a son to not show the lack of skill or something you should have said like it goes in two different scenarios but the trials of sextiles they got they problems too so don't get me wrong but we finna get deep into this now so let's talk about the moon science now let's start off with Moon Moon and air let's talk about moon and air people so for the most part what does air represents air represents thinking communicating analyzing contributing contributors I'm saying air goes deep so all the air signs think and communicate all the air signs think and communicate so for the most part you can be around somebody who don't talk who don't communicate but goddammit if their air side you can bet your bottom dollar that they think it you can bet your goddamn dollar bottom that oh just because you hear surface level astrologers and you think every Jim and I talk too much or you think every Libra talked too much no it's not like that you might come across somebody who got a son in a water or Anna water house or earth house if their air sign and that right there reconstruct their thinking pattern so instead of thinking and communicating they think and communicate with but for the most part what you can thinking if they're in Aquarius Gemini or Libra so there's my air signs right now now the way y'all think and communicate is in different ways you're all looking at this energy in a different angle and the angle is the modality so Libra is Cardinal Gemini is mutable Aquarius is fixed so for the most part when it comes to the moon signs in air this is what makes y'all feel comfortable y'all like to react and respond to information y'all like to react and respond to communicating y'all like to react and respond to logic this will make sure I feel comfortable so anytime if you are a moon and air sign anytime you are around people who don't think who's kind of stupid who's not logical who's irrational who anytime you around these kind of people it could make you feel uncomfortable and it can make you feel Moody to the point that you may have to do something to these people to get away from them another argue or a friendly argument or detach from this person or don't call them again so you see them saying that's how this plays out but you never mind a good time because you guys are curious so you guys always don't mind a good time but y'all know when who you are around y'all start to think and put yourselves into this person's brain and to see if this is always going to be a good time so this would make sure are very light because once y'all see one person characteristics and traits y'all are able to think and see if this would be a better time next time or worst time and then y'all know how to leave the boat before the boat has sailed somewhere so a lot of times this would make sure double-sided two-faced it not just Gemini's Libra and Aquarius also but just the way y'all do it is very different a Jim and I may do it a little bit more reckless and careless so they may be seen they may be seen as a little bit more shady than Libra and Aquarius just do it libras just do it with a little bit more attack a little bit more tactfulness and Aquarius a lot of times may not ever put themselves in a situation to have to do that but if there is in that situation they don't mind doing that they don't mind being sarcastic talking Dana's cool was cool with you as you thought they was you should have said now Clarence to flip on your ass in a second now we're talking about moon science right now so let's talk about each one individually because all y'all are thinking of communicating in your own way so let's start off with Gemini now Jim and I moon science now the moon that the moon got a couple placements it boat but uh with the moon the moon and Jim and I don't really the moon don't how gonna play out right this makes people react and respond to curiosity now a person who too curious sometimes don't have morals sometimes don't have a good stable system so it leads them to be gullible you should have said so Jim and I lose sometimes can be a little gullible so be aware of that if you are Jim and I moonshine have to be too gullible and you might not think you gullible because you might got a lot of other alignments that make you forceful but for the most part your mind is curious so that curiosity always leads you into some form of gullibility so even if you're a person in your life you gullible your curiosity lead other people into dumb sick you said I'm saying so you don't take the person that you'll get everybody shot by you being a Jim and I move you know I said yeah chill out you get everybody got their learn how to not be too curious and learn how to direct your energy into places that it needs to be in but for as hell because y'all know how to put yourselves in other people's shoes and y'all use that against people see as a fire sign me I rather not try to act like somebody else so I so I feel vulnerable I feel like I'm doing something wrong when I'm trying to see something from other people's point of view and then use that against them you know I'm saying and then act like I don't know what's going on I feel weird of tea right there look like a cup of tea so I'll be learning from y'all on the side though you know I'm sad but I'll be feeling uncomfortable but y'all muhfuckas night at sink sit back and take somebody else's flaws or just add a third and act like you don't know what's actually going on and like that ain't like and you talk about it to other people like yeah especially if you a female Gemini moon you'll call your other friend like yeah I'll just be called her because I'd be over there and man I'm the over her friend her man always want me to set it thought you got though I say that y'all friendly y'all put up front so like no I'm saying if you in a relationship with someone that's a gym and I moved I feel sorry for you I feel sorry for you because they put up one side when they around you but they got a whole nother side around other about them cuz that's what makes them feel comfortable some say that is a comfort zone being uncomfortable sometimes is they comfort zone like just weird like this the devil the reason they're now synchronicity how I just came up with talking about the moon in Gemini first but yeah that's keep that in mind but y'all for your own good y'all gotta learn how to not be using other people a weakness as a gibster just because you just because you need a way to work just because you need something done you know I'm saying stop using other people's weakness against can be a detriment you know I'm saying uh now the other air side moon and Libra and respond to relationships and being relatable now relationships isn't always necessarily back to supported by a partner it's always how you handle all your relationships whether it's your siblings run the ratio uh friends you know I'm saying family whatever like you know I'm saying your co-workers your relationships on all sorts so a Libra moons I think about these things this what y'all think about life you're always thinking about somebody else and here's what y'all can go wrong gap y'all might do that too much to the point that damn when you gonna think about yourself when you gonna get the UH more end of the stick subscribe if y'all ain't already already knows the deal but for the most part here what's gonna happen and you like when you don't get more end of the stick stop thinking about other people because all you gonna do is manifest situations that always show you it's time to think about yourself and I know it gets uncomfortable I know it gets nerve-racking at times when you think too much about yourself you start to think like damn but what if this person I know it's uncomfortable for a Libra moon that's real uncomfortable for a Libra moon when they start thinking about when they don't have to think about nobody else he even if the Libra moon is in a relationship where this person makes them relax and be like look I'm gonna take care of everything what's that going to long for a Libra like that like damn it ain't nothing for me to do I'm supposed to do something I gotta have my half of something so it's like you you're always thinking about somebody else and this would leave y'all to cheat to here on seconds cuz see what happened is especially for you Libra moon what happened is look you'll be in a relationship at home end up getting real close to somebody at work but you just look at him as a friend but by you having that Libra move you're always thinking about your relationships so that friend relationship at work slowly but shortly start to blind you into thinking that it's an actual relationship this slowly but shortly your cheat on your goddamn partner and good attitude you gonna start a lot y'all you got that not it's not that you wanted to cheat it's just sometimes you can't help it y'all constantly think about sex probably more than Scorpios you see I'm Sam and sometimes it's like you can't help it because your mind is always on your relationships so your mind is on your co-workers and everybody what you if someone is feeding you conversation feeding you attention feeding you feeding you all this convo and and feeding you all this information to Libra moon you're gonna start thinking about that person more than the person you in a relationship with you see them sad so keep that in mind so you know Libra but y'all don't mean - you don't say yeah I got a I got a good heart and since that heart is directed in the wrong areas sometimes you got to think about yourself think about your own Olympic conditions think about think about what might happen stop caring about everybody else all the time you know I'm saying just talking all sweet to you all day at night make you make you you think about that nigga's problems all day and night don't mean you gotta cheat on your partner just because this person giving you feet and you comments should go deep so even if you a guy or a female and you in a relationship with a Libra moon and they got a job never saved you your relationship ain't about it though your relationship ain't never safe and you in a relationship with a goddamn Libra moon so keep that in mind and they don't mean to do it and they know what a lot real good so if they do do it they might do it once or twice and regret it but if you ain't catch that damn lock just start getting comfortable the best they ass watch they ass now but that very helpful y'all know how to make yourselves a part of a part of people's plans and you're very creative very I'm saying y'all like real creative because y'all know how to put ourselves in other people's shoes but for my artistic nature so y'all know how to put words together and present it in a way that everybody could understand it you know I'm saying both parties or multiple parties can understand it so yeah I'm uh yeah I'm not too deep y'all kind of bring it to the surface level so for people who don't know how to necessarily do that who may have mercury inside your Pisces now if you got the moon in Aquarius now I'm moon in Aquarius now these they are you don't know if they're Pisces moon Gemini moon Aries Moon Leo moon you don't know what the view if your honor got them Aquarius moon you just surround an alien Point Blank period you don't know what sign is and they can interchange all of them in an instant they can be communicators they can be passionate they can be emotional or they can be practical aka they can be water fire air or earth you won't never know but how you pinpointed is if this person start being if they start being predictable with that energy then that's when you can be like oh okay this is an Aquarius moon right here if they start being predictable like damn I don't know what this person is up to I don't know what this and they start being too predictable of being unpredictable that's an Aquarius move I like how you do that like it's always do something being up ridiculous but that's how it works though that's the only way you could have pinpoint an Aquarius moon though right and if you around the unpredictable you like them I can predict that this person like to do something or say something I know there's gonna do before nine times out of ten you around there Aquarius move and a lot of times they hurt themselves a lot of times they may need things from others but they'd rather not just for the sake of being an individual or just for the sake of being unique and original or just for the sake of a lot of times I don't even know what the sake of I can't even tell you I just know I'm around one but that's how I be y'all muhfuckas real unique look a little a little too unique not gonna Ninja Turtles movie but I was like it's quiet Oh mr. Turtles - when I was about to go fight the Hutt and they had to go save Raphael cuz his dumb ass went too far and got trapped by the foot so all these they was doing something sneaky I think little too quiet a little too quiet this would be like scale ownership then they got they ass beat but for the most moons not gonna be a little - a little - you need to the point that people to start looking at y'all like weird so the don't have to do like it'll be like offer you a rod or something like that and you'll rather not take it and Noah yo ass needed that right like it's like like weird like a Loki like but y'all think y'all being unique and original and showing people y'all don't need them but y'all do it actor actor thought of something else at the thought of you do you should have said thank you so I've been sick I need to get well and said get to Satchmo hey I'm gonna start we're gonna talk about sash mood I'm gonna get to the fire size next but goddamn again that's hot that's that's goddamn y'all queer move gotta move so unique a lot of times it's too unique to the point that you ain't gotta be that damn unique and I'm saying it's okay sometimes people what want you to ask them questions sometimes people want y'all to to make them feel like you need them you don't say cuz without that there's no friendship you say I'm sad so keep that in mind clarence bones don't be too different but y'all can talk to y'all ass off to y'all know how to put up Eagles and personís and y'all use your way of talking y'all uniqueness as an ego you don't say y'all use your difference y'all different nasai go so a lot a lot of times when people call ya'll weird when people call y'all different y'all look at that as a plus y'all y'all like cater to that you know I'm sayin y'all don't look at that like I'm downing so a lot of times that's actually cool also so we all get into the mouth of a fire sighs next part me now we get into the see and feel so all the fire sighs they like to see and feel so everything that's under seeing a filling is visions because for the most part we're getting into the yin Ram but we're trying to express the yin realm so when you see something would have seen visions but when can't nobody else CEO visions so your vision is what is inside you cuz you're developing it with your chakras when you're making two chakras together so this is your inner fire your inner smokeless flame you see them saying so dick the spirit like that takes those spirit loves taking those shapes and forms because those shapes and forms mimic the spirit realm the the fastest more faster than the dets once you send Sam but for the most part those are just vehicles we create and use for consciousness so that's fire so your light fire so fire gives what passion visions intuition insight and lighten me cuz you're lightening up your inside and then you need to know that once you get on that frequency vibration you will understand that life doesn't mean light as in light spectrums you said I'm saying it means light as in weight so spiritually when you lighten yourself up this how you can spiritually float higher thank you so much for the donation genja up Jenelle speaks I like that name and you know say we got a lot of sass moves about funny even big sister this mother down but for the most part fire is envisionment its ease and enlightenment so anytime you get a spiritual nature that's you realizing you need to detach from Lord animalistic nature's so you're lightening up your load in some way shape or form anytime you get into your passion and to you detach from old waters or old Earth's or o airs it can a old spaceships that's wearing you down so you get into a transforming energy to lighten yourself up so flow through you see them saying so this wood fire represents spiritually not scientifically astrology wise and spiritually you say I'm saying so when we talk about fire sighs and when we talk about the moon this is your moon sign is who you are you have a fire spirit you react and respond to passion you react and respond to intuition you react and respond to enlightenment you react and respond to expression because expressing yourself so this is a person who has to express their internal world your internal world is your imagination you'll fire your chakras your light bodies so fire science has to express their visions otherwise no one else will see that light no one else with no one else will feel that heat y'all say there will be no such thing as getting hot without fire science so stars have to get hot before they explode how they gonna explode if you don't get hot now down here scientifically y'all think getting hot is how y'all lost in the Sun gettin high it's when two chakras or two shapes and forms comes together as waves that's what hot is and it cause friction and you get to see an explosion so your me tell you this metaphorically so why do you think with someone explode or get hot they become popular why do you think you say the same words oh this person hot or this person just exploded it is personally this person light up the room why do you think you say the same words scientifically your spirit have no choice your spirit always gonna remind you that there's an energy signature but hi everything that's a shape and form in front of you your spirit always gonna remind you that is separate from the matter what language and therefore once we actually understand this and no matter what language we all speak I bet you will still be able to understand each other bet you see them said so we don't need will all fire represents so well you got the moon and fire the moon and fire this is what you like to react and respond to you like to react to respond to expressing your comfortability expressing your visions expressing how you see and feel about things now each fire signs see this way in a different angle it can a the modalities so you got Aries which is Cardinal you got sash which is mutable and you got Leo which is fixed so we gonna start with sad since we started with mutable with the air we're gonna start with Sagittarius moves so off Sagittarius moon signs you guys like to react and respond to mutable fire be immutable and being able to adapt to your own or other people ways of seeing and feeling about things so right here this is little bit wisdom knowledge meanings reason is spirituality broad perspective of things so this would make you feel comfortable having advice having wisdom and knowledge not just jumping into experiences without no meaning and reasoning like you gotta have a meaning of reasoning otherwise ain't no ain't no meaning and reason for me to experience or respond see that's what makes you feel comfortable and you feel comfortable with lightness so you don't feel comfortable with too much heaviness everybody a person trying to drag everybody down a person to negative a person in the room that just darken up the whole room this was your run away should have sent a known that circumstances situation under any circumstance you should have saying there they escape so here's where to escape energy come from anytime you try to put a sash moon into a cage and it's for all sad signs but especially sash moons so what makes a person feel comfortable don't Ave a sash moon space you will make them feel uncomfortable you know I'm Santa naughty they are they got all the cheerful in the world to make you feel like that you might that they want you face but really they don't want you in expense you should have said they just don't want to make you feel like they're down a downer they always want to be optimistic they always want to be light they always want to be free they are and they always want to be like fruitful as far as communicating and they like like to expand shout the sound of rise is ruled by Jupiter also so they like to expand they like to expand on a visions so these people got way more broader visions than say your Ares moaning Oh Leo moon not to say that they're better or worse that that's not saying that I'm just saying as far as visions wise you know say they like to because they take their visions and they like to react and respond to other people's visions how other people see things how other people feel then they sit back and see how they feel and a lot of times it's hard for Sagittarius move to have their own feelings they're too busy observing and understanding other people's feelings they're too busy observing and understanding other people ways of seeing things so when it's time for them to have their own way of seeing and feeling about things it's almost like which way to go which way to go so they only know how to come up with a broad perspective on how to see and feel about those things in general but it's never necessarily they're genuine their personal emotional filling and when and when it's time to actually do that it hurts the Sagittarius move because the Sagittarius move never really want to come down to that level to have to express how they truly feel about you you said upset is it feel like a downer feel like we got to come back down in our animalistic body and feel like we got to come back down here and if we even surround it around people that make us do that it's almost like I did it why like you that's that skate energy come in again you see them saying so sash mousse is very wise but the way y'all express yourselves a lot of times maybe may show a person at you a lot like a Gemini you know I'm saying what you might not be as communicative as a Gemini but you might give off a shady energy you might give off like a to fixing energy and you don't mean to and just a lot of times you don't you're trying to save yourself from being put in a cage because a lot of times our responsibilities feel like a cage when someone someone make you feel responsible for something or make you feel obligated or give you a schedule that they need you for all the time that feel like a goddamn cage for Sagittarius moon like that ain't comfortable for a sash moon and a sash moon will utilized a Sun and ascendant in order to get to a comfortable space to do that so if they got an attached from your ass or disappear from your ass or make up something or why they didn't or not pick up your dad do that in order to have a breath of fresh air so they can be free a little bit a little bit then once they get that build up self-esteem again to be in your presence again then they can you that'll be your best friend again but you always got to get that sash moon that time you they can't do that every day it's fire it's not Earth they got a recharge since an sash mu got a recharge because they give a lot see fire sighs give a lot especially to move the moon and fire you give a lot so when you give so much once you go back and redraw you gotta visualize all that and you got a recharge you can't do that again you just set that that stays high it's like it's like it's weird it's hard to explain but sash moons got a recharge you know saying they just can't be in front of you all the time you don't saying can't be around neediness all the time now but very wise you know I'm saying hey I got a broad perspective things spiritual by nature don't say you you natural teachers natural preachers natural teachers and preachers period you should have Sam and you naturally come up with moral systems and a lot of times our moral systems being an illusion of trying to escape a lot of tasks so sometimes you got to look at the thin line between you just trying to escape from a person place or thing and you coming up with a moral system but for the most part you can you know how to double-dutch that shout to uh Shakey's per year thank you so much for the donation uh hold on let me get out the energies real quick we get we talking about sash moving right now and I think we've done something about sash move cuz I gotta get into the houses also now uh Aries move for my aries moves out there now somebody said my hair is tight now if i hearing you getting into Aries moon now my Ashley Burks out the Ashley bridge so group in this mother she I'll let y'all this now this is Cardinal fire initiating and creating new ways of how to seat and feel about the world that we are in so this how this how the aries moves look at seeing the filling so aries move right here just kind of frustrates the moon this makes the moon passionate now these people are very smart very passionate very intuitive but they can become very reckless emotionally chaotic and self detriment to themselves yourself saying so keep that in mind now we can get to virgo moon yet so aries law could be very detrimental themselves because you're constantly trying to initiate and create new ways of how to see and feel about emotions of feelings so you don't you don't never take the time and it's hone in on it and to see if that emotion the feeling is a negative or positive one like soon as you get it you pick up the first bob and you if you think it's negative that's what you start expressing if you think you ever you think it's positive that's what you express so a bunch of over-excitement energy can be played out here with the moon with the Moon in Aries slight over expressive over excitement overdoing and it can be too much so you got to temper it down a little bit but for the most part there are that energy if it's directed in the right area goddamn it you can manifest anything in this goddamn world with that Aries moon because it's dealing with passion motivation desire you don't say int it but if those things not met and it be met with anger and aggression so these are fighters to warrior spirits you know I'm saying but you just gotta learn how to direct that energy if you direct it into information you'll be the smartest it into sports you'll be the most athletic person in the world if you direct it into anything you direct that Aries moon into it's like it's like a single tunnel vision and you know how to go straight to that path like no other where other people's may start a path in slack a little big on this pass specialty sash move sash and I could contested that a sash moving started packing slack and you know and sometimes got a got a remind themselves to get back in that tunnel an Aries move know how to stick to one turn on 0 like a race car and go straight down at one tunnel now sometimes it can be single-minded no I can be single-minded but without single mindedness that that's a person who's not honing in on one idea to understand that idea for what it is so we need people who single my to here from time to time but for the most part you got to learn how to not be single-minded because you might go too smart as hell and y'all got Auto passion and intuition and you're very spiritual also but if you direct your energy into some physical or material that you could become very non spiritual like super atheist like when you got it Aries move you don't say like whatever you do you go total extreme even more extreme than than the sach like a sad son is more extreme than a sad mood and the Aries mood is more extreme than an Aries son don't ever forget that you don't say now uh because the mood size is more like the moon changes everything because the moon is your first Macabre your first light body so it changes everything y'all saying like you might like for example I know you probably always hear about Aries Sun signs like I hate sports you know say I don't give a goddamn sports so don't just think just because I'm Aries or Aries like sports the mood changes everything but my moon being in Sagittarius I like to react and respond to wisdom knowledge meanings and reason is two things so I go extreme towards that so I'm extreme into thinking there's no meaning and reason into me playing sports so the guy should want to tell us about look what oh so changes everything the mood changes everything so when you got a Moon in Aries you need to know is that you could be impulsive you could have bad nerves you could be explosive I mean at the drop of a dime you could go from zero to a hundred you know I'm saying so you gotta be careful of that also with it Aries move but with the Aries moon lows you know how to direct that energy you all that goddamn passion and will inside probably can't even handle your goddamn self so you need that you need to be in a job that you got you have your own schedule or you could be your own boss otherwise you gonna be super frustrated and moody every day at work you gonna be moody every day at work ain't gonna be one good day at work the only time it's gonna be a good day at work and somebody make you made you to boss that day or something you ever explained was a good day at work you think I'll never have a good day at work that you explained that you had good conversations with people that ain't never a good day at work for you thank you so much for donating donation except here's the will folks he is that queer son but Aries moon this is so true you got an Aquarius son so god damn and that's liked info for you but that's moon a little bit more stable but also a little bit more stubborn than the sash the sash moon may be a little chaotic so keep that in mind like a sad mood to be Aries mode will be single-minded so they might not be as chaotic and reckless and living here and there and here and there like the sash moon they might got they set go but they might be single-minded but the Leo move know how to fixate themselves into a circumstance of situation but then a lot of times they may be stubborn too so keep that in mind so now here's the thing when Leo moves though y'all are fixed fire so y'all got y'all all fixated way of seeing and feeling about things so for the most part this kind of y'all may have your own vision so dumb buddy come in and try to give you our another vision another insight trying to make y'all look out something in another way here's where y'all get competitive and y'all might get a little bit more competitive than the Ares son I'm saying so err allele mood is more competitive than an Aries Sun side you should have said believe that but y'all know how to make it up and cover it up so y'all might y'all might cover it up and being the best dress Oh or y'all might cover it up and to being or getting the most attention or y'all might cover it up and to being the most smartest like whatever y'all like the most smart like whatever y'all direct y'all energy - that's the illusion or the coloring that's y'all filter in your competitive energy but y'all I'll compete with a tree that look better than y'all he's a goddamn tree to being on those stage hey y'all y'all because y'all know how to manifest attention y'all know our Manifest attention see now it's now the leo moon is very different than Leo Sun and Leo ascending thank you so much for the donation I am evey see the Leo move y'all might have to search for attention a lot more like the Leo ascendant just gets it the leo son put things out there and create things to get it the Leo move y'all y'all get frustrated when y'all don't get it so it's like y'all don't naturally attract it so y'all create moods and emotions to get attention you see them saying so y'all y'all really have to make sure y'all into some type of creative endeavors y'all y'all really have to make sure y'all into something else besides just being you because just be you and if that don't work or goddamn the people in your life is going to get hailed the people that's in your life catch hell when you being you don't work Jim say see the Leo son is a little different they can just be themselves and create things the Leo ascendant is a little different because their personality you just gets it the Leo move is just this which all just care about y'all not y'all not and y'all not necessarily uh that's not necessarily your personality like the scent it's your move it's your moon so let's just your moves it's a sharp motion so a lot of times y'all feel like y'all need more than which are getting a lot of times y'all just feel like y'all should be getting attention when really you don't deserve it you know I'm saying but y'all end up sitting back and coming up with ways on how to get it but y'all utilize it with y'all benefits y'all got moves and your emotions so a lot of times y'all create personas or y'all emotionally connect to other people and that's what that's how y'all get attention the way how y'all emotionally connect with people so the way how you sway your moods the way how you sway your emotions the way how you carry yourself the way how you express your ideas so what's going on internally inside you and then that's how y'all gain attention and things of that nature but the stuff the stuff that make y'all feel comfortable it's entertainment the stuff that y'all react and respond to and stuff that's dealing with passionate stuff explosive things things that's getting attention you should have saying like Leah moons even if you're not the one that's that's gravitating a lot of attention and responding to grand grand juror type things brought tight things explosive type things big big things you know I'm saying attention type things musical type things goofy type things giddy type things you know I'm saying the Leo moon is a lot like the Satchmo yeah I'm saying you could be goofy - but you're not goofy as far as wisdom and knowledge you goofy as far as charisma good word who said that up Lisi dark oh good work charisma yacht yacht oh really boost is not really big on trying to be wise y'all like to experience so y'all like to be out there part you gotta finesse about yourself a character good characteristic charisma you see them saying so for the most part this is what gravitating people to y'all your moves the way you charisma good word or good word that's that's the word I was looking for a charisma that's what gravitate y'all now Ali o son may not have charisma they just know how to the Leo ascended like myself I may not have charisma and just my personality my persona may be like a character but the Leo moon y'all got charisma so even as a like what y'all creating your mother so people who love to hate y'all people always like you know say it's weird it's like but all Leo sun-moon any Cindy y'all gonna get attention from somewhere it's just a given for Leo signs you gonna get attention from somewhere it's just different when it comes to the Sun wood and ascending it's attracted in different ways and when it comes to the moon is more with your moods your emotions your charisma you should've said your kid like you should him saying personality and what you're personally into or other than your actions and how you act it's more your charisma and when people sense from you and what they can pick up from you you see I'm saying so keep that in mind now getting into goddammit um somebody said black sham somebody said Nature Boy is a Leo Moon I think he I think he is he a Taurus Sun Primus taking Leo Moon I think he is my freaking out of ideo he was saying yeah yeah here's a little mo he's easily Omo but yeah you see how he gravitated teacher you see our nature boy and look he's not grabbing attention he's not gravitating attention towards his his his teachers summoning spirits that he don't need to what he need to do is get into his Leo mood and just be a goddamn entertainer then you a save all the stress of people attacking you because they won't have nothing intact you'll be yourself and people will just be entertained and therefore whoa bada bing bada boom you'll be straight you're supposed to be you know I'm saying the moment you start trying to be your your something you not and start then you gonna get all this energy of people being in a disagreeable energy you gonna get waived because you're not in your you're not in your body of water you have to be in your body of water once you're know it may be maybe there's uh his sunshine without your incense I may be his moon sign is in like a teacher house or something like that maybe this moon sign he might got to move his mu saw maybe in a water or a fire house that's probably think he needs to react and respond to teach it like he probably he probably got a moon in the first or the fifth house or or the ninth house or or the fourth house or he probably got the moon and the moon and uh not the moon is moon in the goddamn fourth house or some supposed to you said I'm saying like me my moon is in the fourth house right so I'm I'm reacting and responding to feeling comfortable and being secluded but this is me I'm not supposed to push for house energy out right your sunshine is where it's the house you're supposed to push out so and the fourth power I mean the moon side is the house that make you feel comfortable so wherever your moon at that's what you're supposed to be reacting and responding to it what makes you feel comfortable so by my moon being in my fourth house I need to make myself feel comfortable so I need a flight cave I need a bat cave this is how I could be the most clearest for my comfortability now the outside that's not for the whole outside world to see you know I'm saying so a lot of my emotions and feelings and my moon like energy I need to keep that private because it's in the fourth house so that's how I feel comfortable the more I keep more in my emotions private the more I handle my own domestic issues the bartender my own emotional comfortability now my son is in a knife house so what I supposed to show people is teachers wisdom knowledge so I'm in my right nature so anytime I teach anytime I preach I don't get no negative energy anytime I say I'm Archangel Uriel I don't get a bunch of religious people saying no you not no you not I get a bunch of religious people saying them just bypass it they don't even realize I said I'm Archangel Uriel because I'm in my own energy and something in some way shape or form I'm going to be received positively now if it was somebody else and and they got another alignment and then they say oh I Muriel and I just add a third they gonna have 100 religious people saying no you ain't no you ain't this that a third because they're not in their body of water let you get it as long as you in your original body of water you don't got no problems you ain't got no friction and you should be the dumbest person in the world a person will appreciate your governess like because you yourself as long as you yourself you will always be okay thank you so much for the UH donation Jill I think you so much I just dropped the future thank you so much for the donation once again ashleigh.burns Jim and I move I'm damn you because we brought down juvenile moves already in else but I'm gonna come back to you now uh now we're getting it to listen let's talk about earth moves right you know I'm sad now earth moves in this think and be practical so was all things that fall under make it make a sense out scheduling practical Isaac routine shapes forms of a ground to stand on stability foundation so all earth signs all y'all earth moon signs all y'all like to react and respond to that energy and that's what make sure I feel comfortable loyalty stability a bonus comfortability being sure about something not too much faith not too much spontaneous energy facts hard core facts so this will all y'all earth moves like to react and respond to and this will make sure I feel comfortable so yeah I don't like to be around too many people who unscheduled unscheduled like y'all don't even like having jobs that's say to hell with a goddamn tip service so that's earth moves period that's what's gonna make you feel comfortable you ain't gonna never feel comfortable at no temp service job like an air or a fireside or even a waterside earth-moon signs yangon ever feel comfortable I know goddamn temp service unless that goddamn manager in this site your mind up and made you it made you feel like your ass gonna get hired in so that's the size of fact now for the most part here here's the thing all y'all look at this energy in different ways so for the most part the different ways is the different angling it can add a different modality so torus is fixed Capricorn is Cardinal Virgo is mutable should say so let's so this what makes virgos a little bit more unstable than the Capricorn and Taurus this one makes them a little bit more nervous worrying like or look or have to be a little bit more sure so they put a little bit more action into being sure and making sure the schedule is found dating a little bit more faster than a Capricorn and a Taurus because they lack Venus energy and also it's mutable earth earth is likes likes to be stable or foundation but when you got the mutable modality in that spectrum mutable is liquid so anytime you got earth in a liquid form its melting so it's not stable so this would make virgos not as stable as Tauruses and Capricorn within the mind they look a little bit more chaotic they may kill you a little faster than a Taurus and a Capricorn will but for the most part this would makes them that way because the the rock the earth energy is too fluid it's liquefied because it's immutable but that's besides the fact now let's talk about each one and let's start off with the mutable one let's start off with Virgo moons so are you Virgo moves now for the most part you guys like to react and respond to a mutable earth being so you guys like to react and respond to other people's comfortability what what what other people make sense what how other people get things working like so a Virgo moon always need an example they can't never just come up with an exemple on they own and they can but it always makes them nervous with presenting it they always need the facts first they always got to make sure first and a lot of times this would makes them do research and research nine times out of ten what makes a Virgo moon smarter than you but by default they may lack a little bit more creativity than you because by them being by them by them being having a mistake to make them do research faster than you they're smarter in areas but a person who's always willing to do research they may lack the ability of coming up with their own ideas at times you should say so it's a gift and a curse it's a gift and a curse but they everything you need everything you need their help you with and these Virgo moon you around somebody who ain't a Mexican but they work like

relaxation with the book you thought keep the house clean in this further moves is hard real y'all just gotta y'all got to learn how to relax and not be too nerve-wracking when you are relaxing that it that is what relaxing is you need to know that when you get when you can have days off and stuff like that that that's please take that time all right now check this out Capricorn now moon in Capricorn here's the thing the moon falls in Capricorn you know I'm saying not fall but it's a wait so it's that work so we've got to do things so it's water whoa it just got to do things that they don't necessarily want to do you know I'm saying so the moon can become very frustrating for more than Capricorn so a lot of y'all create frustrations in your own life and my my daughter is a Taurus son and a cat moon so uh she got a lot of that six nine energy and then I got a cousin I got a cousin that's a pixel Bandit II you know I'm saying so for the most part all my Torrance's side cat moves out they're not not but you could be any sunshine but just Capricorn moons period Capricorn moves y'all always and it's not your fault it's just a move Foss here so the moon is dealing with the mother the motherly energy so the motherly energy is not necessarily your mother it's just a mystic energy of it so it's the energy of stuff that makes you feel comfortable so early in life if you are born and you got a Capricorn move it's not it's not it's like almost normal for your parent you don't say like both parents may not be there or you made that you may be raised by someone else in the family or or or you may be adopted or you may be raised by your grandparents or if you up situation and you start to build all this resentment and foundation in your life and struggle and work ethic to get out of that circumstantial situation but in some way shape and form Capricorn laws always manifest harshness and it's like weird and even my daughter is like I couldn't even make this up Capricorn moon and automatically she's being raised by one parent and I'm I'm saying I ain't got no relationship with my baby mother like under like I don't even have a relationship to the point that I can call her and be like yo Kiki watch can you watch my daughter real quick and this day it ain't even that kind of relationship like this peer is purely like me and and then me and my goddamn mom you should have said like light and it's weird not sit back and look at that it's like it's weird it's like that it's like damn and it is off and my daughter and cat moved so for the most part it's deep like that you said I'm saying cat moves I don't know why y'all manifester I need to look deep into that but for the most part if you are a cat move and you hair life blessings to you blessings to you because you rare like you rare you rare in this world it's a bunch of celebrities that's Capricorn moves that I guarantee you they you go today interviews talking about they life story so yeah you shot this on the rise yes y'all need to say we didn't do it y'all do a little bit more research and see why is that so I'm gonna go look somebody said Scorpio moon and I got one parent she like dice Scorpio moon share a lot of energies with Kat moons because the moon falls and Scorpio and the moon is away in Capricorn so you know musashi I'll share a lot of the same kind of falling energy when it comes to the the motherly energy and the motherly energy is just the forms of being comfortable so cat moves and even squirt Musa we don't get to Scorpio moves but cat moves y'all grew up in life your manifest scenarios of uncomfortability and Sun shaped in some way shape or form your manifest scenarios of uncomfortability in some way shape or form I don't know why I do not know why I will sell with that cap in it what's up with the up dawg but it's not all negative let's flip on the positive side you're also going to manifest some form of stability in your life no matter what y'all might have grew up in life without note without people there but all all those success stories of talking about man I had nobody there for me or whatever like that but that was all I needed now nine times out of ten I was a cat moon y'all muhfuckas gonna manifest some stability in your like go period you might have the hardest life ever but it may it put you in the position keyword position and that's how your mind work you got like an organized mind you know I'm saying like you yo your mind is relationships in your life from the situations in your life from the siblings in your life you always organize them you always resize them you always reshaping you always downgrading you always upgrading it's like your mind work like a computer what a cat move like your mind is a straight-up computer like you start deleting programs you add programs so you're very non emotional you're not emotional so this is another lives because y'all can take it you are harder than a lot of other people you don't saying so it's like by you just having a cat move you can take more you can endure more than a lot did a lot of other people say per se people who got Pisces moon or people who got y'all can endure way more than those people way more like y'all can endure so much and y'all and y'all take it as in a way of y'all don't even look at it as a form of enduring or endurance y'all look at it like oh this dis life and other people look at y'all as examples like oh that's that's what I need to be this person is a form of strength I need to feel that way about my feelings and then y'all be looking at people like yeah I don't even know why they feel that way about they feel it's like I don't even look at it like that like y'all serious but not serious ass and like just like emotionally serious like you do so deep in your emotions you don't want nobody picking at it y'all are serious as in dry to the point that y'all don't want somebody forcing y'all in y'all motions and fitness so when y'all around people that's trying to force emotions and feelings out of y'all that's when y'all get serious that's why y'all might y'all start getting like old on auto hood oh and that's what y'all start using our material or y'all status to create a scenario for these saying so yeah y'all muhfuckas are strong and I'm saying y'all strong mentally and emotionally y'all got strong emotions so try not to yeah you're like grow up ask parents even if you're the youngest sibling y'all have parents - no - the older brothers and sisters shout out - uh-uh thank you so much for the donation I deserve flowers one you got a tourist move god damn it yeah so I think we already know me and break down towards money yet we finna get it to that next but yeah yeah Capricorn moons y'all your older brothers and sisters of your aunties and uncles like how you do that but it's just y'all for some reason that Capricorn moon put y'all in the position that y'all have to keep everything straight y'all have to keep the family together y'all have to make sure everything calm cool and collected y'all have to make sure everything's straight you know I'm sad and it can get frustrated to the point that a lot of times y'all might end up crying to y'all selves sometimes but y'all won't let nobody else see that y'all damn sure won't let nobody else see that y'all scroll now get into uh tourist moves now tourist moves these are the highest manifested highest manifests or all levels because the moon is exhausted here now here's the thing since y'all get everything at your lap that follow your lap y'all got to ability to overindulge so a lot of times the moon and tourists y'all may over exhaust ourselves because the moon is exhausted here so anytime a planet is exhausted it can over exhaust itself so a lot of times y'all made over exhaust yourself into material over exhaust yourself into foundation over exhaust yourself into being too too stable to the point that when it's time to be spontaneous when it's time to have faith y'all miss that opportunity now I'm saying and then y'all might miss what y'all had coming to y'all and y'all might not never be able to get it because he wasn't free enough at that moment so it's good for y'all to have some type of fiery or watery friends at times as as a earth-moon but the tourists moot y'all know how to stick down to something sticks dirty you know I'm saying a lot of times I may do it at the detriment of yourself for an example you may go and extreme into your relationship you might know damn well this ain't a good person to be in a relationship with but you will go off for it you'll go all out and and this to the point that this person has to do something that you will not turn you turn the other cheek about to that data make the relationship the departure and person from time to time because you're not emotionally attacked you guys not emotional either so you guys may start having memories and start thinking how comfortable or hot or hotter sex film and y'all know how to set the emotions your own emotional feeling then once y'all psych up this person's emotions and feelings again thinking that the relationship gonna get back again then that y'all get dry again y'all sure y'all like cheaters like Gemini moves to shell thank you so much for the donation aja read a you and Taurus mood also in the seventh house oh so you got it you got it bad innit you for the most part you your choice moves and you got into the second towel so you got it bad you probably washed up in your relationships got you probably be thinking you in a relationship before it's even I got their relationship in play try not to get played to got that much but try not to be too goddamn player seem sad but for the most part when we talk about mother but uh the Taurus moves in general y'all manifest people in your life y'all know how to manifest things in your life y'all know how to manifest the right place right time type of situations in your life also y'all just have to make sure y'all don't start to use too much of your luck because y'all use data get shot and boom the moon and Tauruses y'all are just as lucky as Sun and Sun satchet heiresses see a moon in Sagittarius ain't really that lucky not even a sin in inside of tears but Sun in Sagittarius that y'all appear to be lucky because that's what scene now y'all moon Tauruses y'all are just asked lucky as Sun and Sagittarius moon but y'all can start to use that as to that y'all vantage to the point guy you start to think you're too lucky to the point that you'll put your foot in your mouth or sometimes you'll think you can do something that you can't do at that moment based upon the transits and you are you a manifested situation that's out of your favor just because you think that you was always good for that you thought you was always in that person's good favor you thought you was always capable of doing that and it's gonna be that one time that you do that with the moon in Taurus that somebody show you do that you're not always good in this area so don't you don't always use it but you lucky so keep that in mind overindulge and over extreme over exhaust yourself in that exaltation but y'all people that people that you think hate you love y'all behind closed doors believe it now um there that's all the earth size so we water so I think I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do the houses in the morning same way I did it like this 12 p.m. I'm gonna do the houses because I know that my phone this phone is not gonna make it through all the houses cuz I did not know this was gonna take this goddamn low I was thinking in my head like man I'm gonna be chopping moon to the Suns that's gonna be like 20 minutes boom I'm gonna talk about Moon in Aries that's gonna be two minutes moon in Taurus that's gonna be two minutes 10 minutes so yeah I'm gonna go ahead and say cuz the house is gonna be the same way so I might as well go ahead and chuck it up and let that be a whole video to itself alright now we're gonna get to the water moves and it's three D now these are the most transparent the most creative the most imaginary the beam like people water moves science because the MU love now but here's the thing huh thank you so much for the donation Frederick Proctor sorry mommy a cow the chiropractor he's got a for my heart mundo we don't get to that you very powerful now the moon don't do that well with Scorpio so let me retract that let me retract that but what it does do in all the water science is give the most imagination it's just when it goes into Scorpio it might be a detriment imagination to the point that you didn't went so deep into your own imagination that imagination is not relatable to the world so you end up being in your own darkness to the point that you end up being the black sheep or your family or you end up just having a person keep a bunch of picked up energy to the point that you end up creating an aura and anytime you got an aura you allow it and if you a person who don't know how to express your aura you allow other people's to come up with their own idea about you and once you get into that area where you have to prove yourself and becomes more frustrating and you live a whole life approving so Scorpio move but we don't get it I want to even talk about Scorpio moment yet we're gonna talk about Pisces move because we broke all the mutable signs first so all of water signs now water is transparent so water is dinner with emotions Phyllis thank you so much for the donation ob 2020 I like that name 2020 vision is Mother now all the water signs water's transparent its elusive its evasive and it takes the shape and form of the environment so it takes the shape or form of all thoughts ideas and people places and things that sits around so when you got the moon here this one makes you feel comfortable being able to understand where someone is coming from but you gotta fill it so it's similar like fire but you can't necessarily see it cuz it's not lightening up so you just have to fill it so you have to connect with it connect so that's the slightly difference with the fire moons the fire moon has to feel but see it from a vision and then they can fill it the water move the water move size has to fill it but they have to connect with it so you can't connect with fire you only could see it once you see the fire there you can fill it but you can't connect with it because if you connect whether you'll burn it so fire moons have to be individual but water moves have to connect so they have to absorb into whatever you're pushing out and if they can't do it you're going to feel uncomfortable so if you have you a water moon Sun and you around somebody I don't care how much logic they're kicking out aka air how much passion they're kicking out it can a fire or how much making sense of practicality they're kicking out and k-8 earth if you can't connect with it you just not gonna be able to resonate with this person in no matter how much sense they make it if you can't connect with this person you just can't get down with this person and that's what Waterloo to a tee have to connect so water move know how to connect with the most illogical person the most irrational person you see them say but as long as we could connect that's how you get a water moon sign Shep saying so water moves on they give you the world these people would give you the for the donation Ashley Burks you said where our house lords and how do I find them your house Lord is when say your first house is Aquarius your first house Lord will be Saturn and Uranus because Saturn and Uranus rules Aquarius so that will be your house lords and wherever your anus and wherever you I mean Uranus's Saturday and wherever you're in is a satyr and is that that would be where your house floors is that like wherever house they in pardon me but yeah water sighs they in mind if they can't connect and ain't for the most part let's break these down let's break down Pisces now all you are moon signs and Pisces now for the most part will make you guys feel comfortable and will make you and the things you like to react and respond to it stains that sinner with dreams creativity knowledge meanings and reasonings and experiences on all sorts this is what you guys like to react to respond to and this what makes you feel comfortable so you guys are like natural teachers natural preachers natural artists knack knack youngest in the creative rail yard naturals when it comes to the Pisces moon Naturals when that in that area but for the most part you could get washed up and to other people's emotions and feelings also so when you get washed up into a case look this is mutable water be immutable and being able to adapt to their own or other people's emotions and feelings so this is that chameleon energy so for the most part when a Pisces move starting to get absorbed and washed up and someone else's emotions the feelings then start to doubt their own emotions of fillers then start to doubt their own creativity then start to doubt their own imagination so you have to make sure you don't put yourself in that situation and you have manifest a lot of scenarios for that for yourself because it's the moon the moon is what makes you feel comfortable and what you react and respond to those are the energies that tap that taps you went to what you're manifesting in your life so what makes you feel comfortable which you react and respond to is the energies manifested so a lot of times pi see pi see moon-sized manifests people places and things in their life that show that makes them feel unsure or makes them feel guilty a little bit more gullible a little bit more passive so and you manifest these days in your life for you to fight through these things so you know so you don't detach from the Lord animalistic natures thank you so much for the donation David love cuz you're only gonna manifest your girls your chakras and the influences that you're in and if you are a Pisces move your lot of manifestations that remind you what you need to get from so once you manifest people places and things that make you doubt your own emotions and feelings you fight through those law animalistic nature then you're gonna start to see how creative you are how imaginative you are how wise you actually are but you have to fight through what you're manifesting the things that's death they'll make you doubt those things you said Sam thank you so much for the donation of officially Oh hehe you said Sun Neptune mercury and Uranus in the first house let me finish the energy side real quick I throw me off for okay you talk about describe me real quick you must be a newcomer shout - uh Michael Merle also thank you so much for the donation you said what I'm happy you feel it a little better can you have a conjunction so uh-huh no let me finish the energy is out real quick cuz I'm Lucy a little bit and what's up I probably break down y'all and I party get too sick to even sons I cut I throw it off I don't even know what saw me on right now moon in Pisces yeah so are my moon in Pisces Suns this is putting us in a situation where we're able to react and respond to dreams a loser's creativity and imagination and when that's not being met you're gonna manifest people who make you doubt these things so try not to put yourself in that scenario but you you always want to put your make yourself apart you're almost like an Aquarius son of Pisces moves know how to network just as good as Aquarius Sun signs you see them saying and I'm gonna do a video too on the mixture of two sides make one side cuz it's always a mixture of two sides that make one side you see I'm saying keep that in mind sit partly transparent y'all very helpful and y'all can see things from other people's point of view so y'all like to make y'all like to make that yeah I know about the matchstick gunpowder this channel to us start underworld II thank you so much for the donation uh look Kendra like Andrea Dotson he already did Scorpio move oh no I knew Scorpio moon yet I'm trippin we're gonna get into Scorpio moon I'm thinking I'm thinking about the earth science tourists move but yeah that's Pisces moon in a nutshell you guys love you love to be the chameleon and you know how to take the shape and form so this by default automatically take you into abilities of know how to network know how to make know how to make yourself so part of things know how to make it such a part of circumstances situations and scenarios know how to get out of it know how to be the chameleon but for the most part try not to get washed up in that wave because if you get washed up in that wave to the point that you will start doubting your own emotional stability and start thinking that you always have to be there to support someone else's emotional stability and you will live a whole life of being an angel for the work for the wrong purposes keep that in mind you get that debt that God simplex god complex and start thinking that this is your duty and obligation and you'll just be putting all this wear and tear on your spirit thank you so much for the donation o-tama in and you say you're a quería smooth I did a crazy smooth already you said a few kiss rises now they ain't no such thing as a few kiss rosin you must be watching too much uh what you could be a fixed star you could land in those the grease but you still a sach you should've sent a few kiss eight the thirteenth side of Lucas as a constellation that made itself a part of our Sagittarius and Scorpio constellation and a little bit of Capricorn constellation so those group of stars of a few cos have connected that constellation have connected but it didn't make extending it didn't extend our 360 like and that's how you know a person who don't really like you have a bunch of people in the conscious community right who see astrology catches steam in a conscious community cuz astrology 8-8 a part of the conscious community believe it or not but for the most part you'll get people in a conscious community and then then then think that they actually make it an argument by saying it's a thirteen sign or they think that they're making an argument by saying we need 13 months don't go there that argument is so Oh in the astrology world please don't be a naive conscious community god damn and you get watched it just by saying that you just by saying that you let me know where you at mentally thank you so much for the donation of Venus cut me know II I like that name but uh yeah just by saying that let me know where you at you chef saying cuz astrologers even know that now you know saying that you got a lot of Vedic Eastern astrologers they may throw people off those people off a little bit like that but I bet you when they doing somebody's they don't read it I bet you they still say it's twelve houses I bet you they still say we live in a 360 tell me tell me what got now if you an astrologer and you talking about his thirteen goddamn science but you still calculate somebody's twelve houses goddamn E you need slapped upside your goddamn head and you don't know as much as astrology as you thought you did because we you when you say as a thirteen sign will you say it's supposed to be twelve months then you need to add a twelfth house you need to add we no longer live in a 360 anymore you need to expand that 360 and the moment you get into that into that I'm gonna tell you that I'm telling you that ahead of time don't even get into that listen to me as Archangel Uriel and just understand that Oh Lucas made itself a part of our constellation we live in one person Aries through Pisces anything that got attached like a tail or something like that came from somewhere else it ain't extend it in extend our body was still in a 360 it in a leap year that that's why we have in a leap year a year and that's why we that's why we always calculate in a 24-hour and exactly at hours it's also second that's why we do that that's why we come in with calendars it takes somebody that's lying to y'all behind closed doors to make ya'll think somebody who's into astronomy and astrology and they understanding the movie because my phone 15% but we still live thank you so much for the donation some time I in now all right Scorpio moves all my god and Scorpio moves right now somebody said I had gotten a side aerial reading a while ago it's not where I'm at just wanted to know your opinion I do listen to it listen side Dario is just basically telling you your Western Chart House house placements that's it your Western chart house placements is your is your vetting your side aerial chart period so is this basically where you coming from for an exemple I'm a Satchmo right but by me being an eighth degree sash loop it didn't make it into my mouth sash fifth house my I got Sagittarius in the fifth house I got Scorpio in the fourth house my mom didn't make it there degree wise so my moon is in the Scorpio fourth house you said I'm saying alone with Pluto so it's inside Dario right I'm a 15 degree Scorpio moon in western my house my fourth house is 15 degrees so my moon land on my 15 degrees house so the same thing it's just you got people trying to split them up and but they're not split they're the same thing so I don't I don't use Western either I use Western Eastern northern and southern they're all the same thing saw the same thing the only talk the only reason they get confused is because they're calling the houses the signs so sister since the constellations are moving Vedic side aerial get lost and try to say and try to make it seem like it's the houses that's moving but when they do readings they read the houses in the same places so they confuse they got themselves it's just the houses we don't need to be calling the houses decides Aires is not the first house but Aires was born in the first house so Airy Star constellation have all the traits of the first house the first house is just a space in the sky it's just the space where spring start so spring don't start way in September March 21st that's when spring start so I don't you could switch the calendar you can put December there spring still going to start in that space that's what side aerial need to understand so if you was Pisces you still a goddamn Aries cuz you was born in that space now where they get confused that is cuz they Star constellation is in the second house now so there'd be like oh no you're not that Star constellation so really sigh Dario this what you just need to tell them oh I'm a first house sign then you should have said they say you a first house no I'm not a I'm not an Aries slash I'm supposed to be a Pisces now no you just the first house you was born in the that and they they did still call you an Aries or they did still call you a all that they try to they try to call you where the constellation is that now and that's where they both get it wrong but it's really we talking about the houses if your son was born in the first house aka when the Sun was going through a spring the beginning of spring March 19th and your and you and your son was born first house sign just say that for we don't get confused between side Dario and East Eastern or Western just say you were first house person so all you got off your son side is the first house traits so the first house trace is nothing more nothing less but what created the Aries constellation you know I've said but Pisces is there now so you just influenced by the Pisces constellation with Aries energy that's first house energy that's it that's all thank you so much for the donation yoko / jetzt Rao oh sure let me let me let me hear it let me hear y'all cuz I'm getting late alright scorpio moves look the move fall here so for the most part you don't know how to react and respond to the emotions web so even with you around super other people who are emotional super super how to do well around these people so you may seclude yourself seclude your own emotions from these people also when it comes to how you truly feel about and when you get into a relationship it's hard for you to truly express that and that becomes a problem in your relationships so your true emotions are Phyllis and you'd be thinking you'd be doing a good job and it always come across wrong so your partner so you need to keep that in mind with the Scorpio moon you know I'm saying now you're very intense so you naturally have an aura even when you're not trying you can have the most releasing energy in the world had the most loving family members and friends in the world that you always release it you just always gotta aura know y'all said so sometimes when you get around new people you you play out like a Leo Sun Sign you might have people who like so Scorpio moves is a lot like Leo Sun signs people think you trying to get attention and you not you just being you a person people think you being at Regan cuz you try to get attention people think you being secretive because you want people to be in your business and know you being secretive because you really don't want people in your business y'all saying you ain't doing this because you because you're trying to get attention or you want or you tryna you know say you get it people will look at you like that don't people like people automatically be like this person think they are that and you and you not you just in your own world and you and you a down so deep into trying to understand why people look at you like that you said say cuz you don't you don't really understand why people look at you like that so for the most alike I lost myself at app ICC I did soon I started talking about Pisces next else yeah Scorpio moves yeah it's hard to react and respond to the world that we are in so it can become overwhelming but by default this syncs y'all into the subconscious world so y'all y'all are person ate even more than the pie see Moon the Pisces moon is very aware of the conscious realm Scorpio moons is very aware of this of the behind-the-scenes realm so a lot of you rather not bring that to the surface express the people it's like I'm cool you know I'm sorry I'd rather keep that inside you know a shout to the oh ho ho glue in my said your name bro Aries son aqua moon I said I broke down I couldn't move I got breakdown alas for my phone dialing breakdown morning cancer but yeah all you moon in Scorpio John deep by default thank you so much for the donation Laila I legit square up your moon in the third house oh so you do this in your surroundings and you're close proximities and everything you're fluent so you do this with your friends you like to be secretive with your friend you probably got that one friend that you tell everything to and y'all be yummy knowing like one hell of a friend with that Scorpio moving real loyal but it's only one friend you can't have a lot of friends like that you'll get overwhelmed Scorpio moves y'all deep but y'all gonna be too deep for your all good to the point that you so deep you might not ever come for a breath of fresh air and may not ever learn how to do that so you never learn how to be social butterflies you never learn how to super be logical the way you're supposed to be you only know you only end up learning how to be passionate about something and desirable about something but if you don't even if you don't even have no artistic way to express that that becomes frustrating in your life so you become a person that's always behind closed doors a person that's always in the dark and then you like that to the point that y'all ain't doing nothing hindering ourselves but it goes deep but for the most part Scorpio moves out to be very you're very strong though very passionate about what you do and can't nobody steer your direction into another way so y'all can become highly motivated y'all just have to make sure that y'all don't get lost into the world to the point that you end up don't Norwood no I want to be motivated about but you always got that motivation energy now Mooney cancer this part marry the best be hehe so when you got the moon and into moon she gets to sit back and relax so you know how to handle emotions and feelings you know how to help other people with their emotions and feelings you know how to you know how to set the vibe you know how to set the tone you know how to make other people feel comfortable you know how to be around other people who when they're uncomfortable how to calm them down bit on the flip side you know how to rowdy uncomfortable you know how

#Pokemon #PokemonGame #PokemonBattle",rip Slowbro UU Pokemon Ultra Sun Ultra Moon WiFi Battle vs Richeroni+Pain+Peyton!,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abeKZuYpC7w,0,5852,169,1,32,abeKZuYpC7w,how's it going everybody it is I visual I hope you guys are having a beautiful day and welcome back to another Pokemon it ultrasounded me and Wi-Fi battle if you do enjoy these make sure to leave a like on at the video and the team I'm using is in the description if you do want to try it out it is really fun seen with a jet fun Slowbro which I actually forgot to put regenerator on for this game in the next game I'm going to show you which kind of sucks because it comes into play alot and I didn't even realize that it have a generator until it was too late so yeah make sure you have all your pokémon that are correct I just brought the wrong Slugger I don't know I didn't really check it so ugly I often make steel trying to get my rock so if you let off the mega Beedrill to see turns it on out obviously because you know mega demolish that little B I doubt he will want a drill run me because mega steelix will take that I mean makes it look size insane team guys so he brought a road to me I expect the defog or potential overheat so I go into my Soraka it's a little risky because he could have whisk but I was really feeling it and I'll just lay REI let's just get a knock out or something with Taraki on even though he has arena close to be able to take stone it's pretty easily but what if I saw his answer you never know so unfortunately does Rotom heats hook of the stone edge and I was like what's how up track yawn what are you doing that I'm like did I bring the wrong track down that a big timid or what so I guess it was a defense row to me so i staying on against the Mamoswine went up people's pushed on my track down thinking that you'll get up rocks but unfortunately i got that pulley wrong and to react on goes down i was one of my like best ways to break the wrist seem to like I can just saw his ants up at Stone Edge vs. team but alas I made a risky play and it was a high risk low reward play because my old swine was focused ash - I probably should just switch down this little girl but I mean whatever so I'm browning crew could I go for knockoff just an off chance he goes and sylveon I can get rid of its item to see what it is as well I don't really know what kind of sylveon is because my pretty much end game at this point is to get rid of sylveon and then sweep a krookodile so that's what I'm gonna try and do he actually has hit a power buyer I'm guessing I mean and it's hero silk scissor work what do you expect the hidden power to be most likely in a power fireman blast or hyper voice but I think most people would run that I'm gonna blast on sylveon cuz of soundproof Comeau most people don't even run soundproof Comeau they run Billabong proof I don't know either way I brought slipper on the mammal and as I do not want to get earthquakes and also I was hoping that he would make me so that I can get it to check button counts because I want it I want the eject button to get popped unfortunately earthquakes me afterwards when he got it brought so getting approximately my play and at least I got to bring true get out and crooked I'll just go for the knockoff unfortunately I am intimidated Moxie would've been a lot better this game but I guess intimidate helps out with a shard not doing as much damage to me but marks it would definitely be a lot better because I literally just clicked earthquake and once I get an earthquake kill I could potentially just sweep this team because he does that much but Reena cos probably takes a plus-one and it might be just like fighting Z Trina close and just blow me back so I mean that's what most Buena closes are in the UT I would say by TMZ so I bring in steelix as I'm able to take a moon blast and I'm hoping that silviana would be switching out and fearing they steal move but no piece stays and to hit empower me again and I went for earthquake expecting to switch out you know just doing maximum damage to whatever comes out because I thought it would probably bring I probably shouldn't want for curse or something but I guess for what workers he would knock me off the next in power so I go for jar balls like man this guy really just hidden power fired my mega steelix when I could've just want free to steal move but lo and behold is still going to just takes it like a champ I guess that's what happens when you run charm over yeah heavy slam I don't know I think heavy slam will probably knock out sylveon but mostly on our max defense so I was really surprised I lived to be honest because make steel doesn't want a strong mother trapping like just look at him he does not mess around I mean I'm Mac special defense but I mean still geez maybe I should run max attack on mega steelix women by go for Chris expecting to protect and unfortunately it is not enough because you know hit a power is just gonna knock me out and he wished up so he's like a max each P now what that wish so I was really clutch on him he played it really well I probably could have like came back though if my regenerator Slovo because he does I feel dumb and I could actually just like toxicants team down and maybe play around it with cooky down magnets on Mack Tanya's choice car from the back that's why it works well with the eject button Slowbro because he can just switch it in on sizzle wars on the you turn the you check but now it's magnets on and trap them with any power fire and even their choice Garces or you're faster because your choice car Magnum so anyways like bring in magnet on I said Watford hit power ice I'm assuming I didn't really realize they're always like to run that I guess it's good for a glog art but other than that I thought most people just run like knock off and get rid of guy gars item and mostly just run like physical news so I thought it would be like it may be a special variants here or fight iums evokes blast and like call mine a thunderbolt something like that in hitter price that could be pretty deadly so that's what I was thinking you would be so I decided sack - on right there I didn't really want to switch around because I wasn't too sure what to say or was I don't even know if that would have a fighting move maybe it was not gonna be a fighting move but most Simard and so I brought in slow broke trying to bait the plasma fish but unfortunately he goes for close combat so oh well I didn't really have much else going for me because I didn't have her generator I could have stayed in right there and just like what first called but at the same time he could have just went to be drill you turns and I would have knocked my slipper out and then I would be forced to go to Creek Val and since I'm not like anything special krookodile like attack wise just regular ol crooked out I would be able to have speed the mega Beedrill and I mean it wouldn't be enough to knock out sylveon so there wasn't a chance like I think I should have just played it a lot safe here I really played this game a lot more restful sleep I would say and I mean I still have Tokyo's to play around as well like the u-turns and stuff but I mean booths say he just poisoned Japs my Slowbro so yeah I mean tokus definitely could have had a shot especially if it brought him Beedrill on my Slowbro I could have pursued trapped it if he wanted to switch out but I mean who's saying stays in but I mean at the same time if you stay in an earthquake then tokus can kind of win win the game cuz so kiss air slasher do you know a thing just kind of wins games and flinches everything so that's gonna be a GG to it Richard Roni this is the game where I also forgot to bring her generator silver like I said versus pain and looking at a seam it looks to be either mega all tari or mega aggron I wasn't too sure what it was I was like for sure mingle Tarija and regular Agron sounds like nobody uses regular Altaria like a ground at least can be like scarf head smash and do something or bandit I don't know so yeah I was thinking just make Altaria and then he has a hit pound on so I was like yeah that's got to be rocks Agron has to be offensive for sure and other than that they can maybe scarf Lottie I don't think he'll be scarfing for any of I think most in frames are like nastyplot Swords Dance late-game Taraki on definitely can do a lot of work with Swords Dance I could see it winning for sure unfortunately magnets on can't really trap patty ground because I think earthquake will blow it back and I can't really knock it out with anything maybe Thunderbolt can knock it out or no see either way he leaves off with the hip out on that's a pretty nice lead versus meat as I do have mega steelix and mega steelix does not appreciate earthquakes and we found him so I'm not off a celeb wrote on to counteract that and silver I'll let up well vs. team and I could have fire up talks after pretty nicely as he goes into sylveon which is a nice plate because still guy could easily take that I can for skull just knowledge chance you know I can get him burn on the pad on that could be pretty nice and also just like burn anything in general because it's just nice that burn things scalds just one of the freest moves to ever go for in Pokemon meters and toys can burn things I'd rather maybe burn the hip out on the toxic it because it could have its attack as well so I go for toxic on sylveon and if this doesn't have he'll bail that could be pretty nice for me because then that's one thing gone for krookodile that kooky doll doesn't appreciate and also slow bro can easily take any hits and get a check button pounds and then I get the regenerator which I thought I did like I said I don't have a generator so yeah sucks so I bring the steel and steel well I don't well yeah I do bring steel subject one I get to choose not like I think red card red card is offset of inject one kinda dish because the switch is out the up hazing food come on why don't you attack that by I get to choose Pokemon so I brought steel so I get my rocks up which is pretty nice and he brings in the fountain which is nice as well because it could take anything make steelix goes for except for toxic I guess but I got to bring a slow bro and yeah this is where I realized that every gender does like ooh forever this would have been my solution hip out on but no but this thing gets to a key owed by hip out on so yeah not looking too good for me I don't really have too much about on answers left versus my team when I lose slow go so I have to go into Toa kiss and I gotta hope this thing hip out on doesn't really have much for typical psychic could have stone it's good at toxic I feel like if you get toxic it would have toxic special over a while back then but me just didn't want to gets calmed burned or toxic of his own so go for your slash get a flinch and you know soak is doing what it does best flinching down so you brought an agar on it which I was like okay yeah it makes sense it four times resist flying I don't want to take a heavy slam or a head smash I'm going to switch out my focus and to mega steelix and then he surprised me over here he is mega aggron so I was like oh so it's not mega Altaria it's a regular Atari yeah something okay that's weird but also it kind of sucks because then the mega aggron is a lot more threatening now because it's a lot more bulky or else kind of hoping it would be just regular Aggron so I could just follow with mega steelix earthquake it but that is not the case because it's not it's a fairly gonna take anything for my birth quakes when it's mega aggron but I guess he doesn't want to take it and he goes into powder which is smart but MEC steelix does that ability that I think you know boosts its power stay in force when it's in San so earthquake does a nice chunk thanks to Pat on forgetting that stand up for me but I'm gonna bring in so cos as I can dodge an earthquake since I'm flying in I can go for the air slash and a whittled down to step out on because like I said I don't have much for a patent unless I can you know Whittle it down to a point where Fighting's he hit Tareq young can knock it out which may be a will so go for it slash trying to flinch him and I do which is pretty nice you should probably switch out as a pat on doesn't really have much else versus tokus its artisanal most of the time they're just world Orleans so I switch out into track you I'm trying to catch the mega aggron to come out but he actually goes for stowage and stays on so I was like oh well I got that flavor on I'm gonna switch out cuz I don't want to get earthquake my go-to crew get out because I want to intimidate him and also I do want to knock his office I left a loose which could help out so kiss hair slashing him down so I felt like that would be pretty nice because maybe I didn't really need HP I'm freaking out unless he is gonna be mocked punch at her name but I mean I doubt that he would be say actually goes for curse which surprised me I was like oh okay some more surprises curse if out on did not expect that with earthquake and stone inch that could be pretty problematic for my tokens my go for knockoff regardless because I do want to get rid of his leftovers like I said and pretty much just like a new it's a neutral attack hit found on now since I didn't in medium so the curse kind of negated that anyway so broaden Turkish as I could dodge an earthquake I take stone edge and I could go for the air slash but you know if your slack off keeping the head pound on healthy hits the stone is breaks through my flinch and luckily that doesn't do as much as I thought I mean tokus this is one fat  like look at h beast and stats in general just takes it's four days and luckily sooner she's not stabbed when I pout on since you know I pad on Sheila's kraut tape so he brought an Agron and I mean I could have just roost it on the hip out on but at the same time I just wanted to punch it down so yeah I decided to go for another slash trying to hope for a flinch against MacGraw mega aggron and also maybe he predicts me to switch out like last time it goes from earthquake because he did that but unfortunately that is not gonna be the case I didn't get a flinch and he goes maybe slant and Down Goes tokus so I got to bring a trach out at least loosen tokus kind of sucks cuz now sylveon could be a very big problem front of his always problem too and a lot eat but at least I could have kept after the Lodi like switching for Drake and meteors and stuff so yeah I could have probably just roost it endlessly on that and hear it slashed him down so he brought him out on I'm kind of praying that this fighting Zika knockout hip add-on from the rain it stats I don't really know but it should like just knowing how strong play DMC is and Plus how strong track on is they should and most appearances do like to run more special defense I would say especially since he does have Sylvia I think Sylvia would probably be like max defense so he brought him Infernape I decided to stay in and go for a close combat globally I don't really know what kind of Bernie fizzes and I might as well just find out turns out he is Mach punch but he shouldn't have won from aquage it went for close combat on my track Jana I don't know if he will is not max speed maybe that makes the most sense because why would you go from Mach punch on track down I mean it is speed side but still but you know I'll take this the track and put in some work there got three kills in a row but then in comes the alati and I'm guessing this is gonna be choice careful audiosurf so I'm gonna have to hope to put this in a range for maybe a jar ball and mega steelix so I'm gonna go for it the flash getting over here he actually just stays in and goes for the surfboards pretty nice for me I get so weak in this thing and also I want to keep Eureka down the back that's gonna be my win con as well so I switch out over here kind of hoping that he is gonna switch out because I doubt he would want to stay in allow me to flash game but also at the same time I do need to keep magnets on first his team because it's kind of a win con class after we get out at the same time like even if he does switch out I can you know take advantage of that so I bring in mega steelix I need to keep this as healthy as possible to take a surf so yeah that's why I brought it in and I wanted to knock out the law because actually Magneton could potentially win the game was terrible I mean I Drive my flash cannon so still cannot unfortunately take this jar ball even after rocks looks like he's not running it defense said like the other silicon I played so gonna bring a magnet on cuz like I said I need the Mexicans as healthy as possible and hoping that Magneton can live hit from the silicon which I do which is pretty nice and I could go flash cannon but then he can bring in the Lottie and he has another Pokemon after Lottie and then he can just you know attack me which kind of sucks because I already know this is gonna be Troy scarf Lottie like just the way he's playing it and also maybe it wasn't a choice car and maybe I could have kept trick it out for it so now speed up bump pretty sure it's choice curve like that outs but in my max on so yeah it's definitely his choice careful obviously so yeah I bring in Mike steelix I'm able to live the surf go from dryer ball and knock out the Lottie and now I just gotta hope that Meg steals can beat the last Pokemon which maybe I mean it is a regular ol Altaria what else gonna do earthquake me I'm kind of hoping that it's just gonna be like roost deep fog stuff like that toxic I don't really know that's like the P was set for Altaria like the defensa set but here if you'll see his cotton guard which kind of makes me happy because I'm like okay maybe's cotton guarding up cuz maybe he just has like cotton guard toxic ruse Deepa I don't know but it turns out it's just gonna be like fire blast or something like that he coulda just went for that the first time but I guess it's precautionary cuz you don't want to get Jar bulbs and misfire blast and stuff like that you know you want to get that defense up so it's smart so I curse I'm just kind of hoping that he doesn't have a move to hit me with and I just like want to speed up the process of breaking through I'll target with curse and raise my attack but he blasts me with that fire so that is unfortunate I think what I could have done differently is definitely every generator on this floor bro that would house me Britta's versus a pain over here and first the first game as well so yeah make sure you have your Pokemon the right Pokemon in a battle cuz it can really change the game for sure baby wails a good game nonetheless like it came down to the wire I really enjoyed it and yeah last game we got is versus paint over a year and first paint I actually got the right slope oh yeah you regenerator Slowbro finally maybe I can win with this team I don't know but he found a walrein which you don't ever really see and it's Tianna satsu so I was pretty intrigued with Payne's team I wasn't really too sure what the wall lane would walrein would be how thing and maybe just like Spectre whatnots and I'll stick him Duke see maybe call mines ready just stealth rock and then thought to maybe just magic bounce which was interesting he had definitely have some interesting sets you guys would see I'll leave off steel so because I feel like steelix would be a nice lead because matches up well versus see him and new king I can switch around with if you've led off with that and yeah I Mack specialty fits me I could take it as a surrogate so I got salt rocks up but unfortunately I guess he saw that through and he goes into the suit and magic bounces back the stealth rocks which is fine I got defog on he's hocus if everyone he daddy and then he has flame orb on the disaster you know I was like okay okay then that's weird I don't really know why and then he trips my floor bro on the switchin and my god oh my god okay that's pretty cool because I guess I Bates in physical attackers and you can trick the flame warm then you burn them which is interesting definitely a I could see that definitely catching a lot of people off-guard but did not work out for him he tricks it back gives me my check button back which is funny so I just go for scald and yeah just China you know see how much damage it does to Zod to you and maybe few switches oh I can get a scald burn on something which is pretty nice vs. team so he burned my slow girl which sucks but at least I have my eject on back which is pretty nice and now I switch this out into wall renounce a okay wall ring comes out that's gonna take the skull pretty nicely I can go for toxic though and put this thing on a timer which is pretty nice and I'm pretty sure I can live anything just wall Reno uh sheer cold huh what are we doing here that's banned what are you doing I told him it's banned day he still goes for it I mean I told him it's fine see you at the same time I was like you know I've two bands right and he didn't know so oh well I mean look at us team he had some uu months and pretty interesting sets so I brought magnet on hoping they doesn't go for sheer cold again but he does and hits under my out well that stinks ladies been max on which would have been nice vs. team but oh well so bring us steelix and hoping that he doesn't go for sure cold again cuz you know one-hit ko moves our band and snow gone that's flying nobody uses on unless you play anything goes for other tiers that allow them but definitely not needs here so yeah that's why they're bad cuz he oneshot magnets on some wall fees so anyways I've just go for it ajar Baz he brought oopsie and just dryer ball again turns out to be screens uxie which also have interesting I can bring out my tokus and go her d5s is a perfect time to go for deep bug anybody throws off a thunder wave which really caught me off-guard because I had steel excel he's really like predicting me like every single one I've seen a turn but you know he predicted me with to talk to you switching outs because you know you can't trick it mega stone obviously so I just really spread me I switch something still express it does not see by the way because I was scared of heatwave so yeah and plus also kinda expecting you turned and then I can get the eject but now as well and then I can't wrap it with krookodile just nothing happened both of us kind of predicted wrong anyway so default get rid of the rocks later at the screens and then I he'll bill late at Thunder a so tokus doing what it does best and being annoying for the opponent well serene great air slash and just getting rid of all that hazards and status so it came you know King I go to slow broke kinda has a mid ground and I was weirded out because I was like what where is my chick but I guess shear force isn't that activated check button I don't really know that's the only explanation I can think of or maybe the trick had something to do with it and now since he tricked me a jet button it doesn't work but I'm guessing sheer force doesn't act the eject but not really know you by judging I'll not damage from fluctuated I think it was choice car from UK and now I bring him mega slow mega steelix on the wall green and he tries to hit me with a sheer cold again by my clock you need a calm down there buddy can't be hitting these 30 percent receive moves that want to kill everything you need to calm down I already killed magnet on either way go for Garibaldi broadens out to you and fortunately saw two lives I didn't get to bring a tokus though and I'm able to just fire off some air slashers which is pretty nice if racism he doesn't have to too much versus serene Grace I mean what does when you're slower I mean is I was air aura too able to come in but I mean I got man steals is there we ran a cuckoo dial which choice scarf which is able out speeds there orandas earthquake it so as long as I know hearts which it in and they predict me to switch and trick down and go for close combat I should be good to go see I go for air slash unfortunately and didn't really do much and he breaks through and goes for ruse but this time he brings in new king I guess not playing around with air slime flew air slash flinches and yeah doesn't appreciate that I can go into slow bro again and scout what he wants to go for he goes for earth power and that actually might to shot me so I'm gonna switch out my little bro back into the tokus man it's so good to have a generator on silver I wish I had it the past two games I probably could have one I did so yeah yeah like I said I predicted it was gonna be choice scarf and Lola mode was I'm guessing unless maybe he just didn't think he would be faster than me and he thought that I would air slash motion I don't know either way oops he came out and it turns out to max P Duke C which I was not hoping for at all it's hoping it would be like max defense so he gets to have a light screen up and then he gets cells wrong so which I mean it's fine I could defog later so need to be I just decided here slash because I met a little not having you see the susi was like no attacking you see as well screens thunder waived stealth rocks was pretty interesting so he brought in wall Rena I just go for the defog because I was like might as well I doubt he would have anything else out of that sure cold to hit toka superfecta maybe he does have a blizzard I don't know turns out he does have rest and that is gonna kill his toxic and bring it back with the chest Iberia as well so that's pretty cool but you know it so it kiss is gonna do I'm about it is air slash flinch this thing down and Lorene is not gonna do anything but I guess that's pretty good for sure cold but at the same time I guess that's what I get for a running total you guys tokus here you know it's just annoying play against but hey it does work and it can provide some nice cleric and D fogging for a team so might as well use it I mean it's it's in the team so he brought its era where I go into mega steelix obviously cuz I don't want to take a plasma fist and I'm hoping that I can easily just earthquake the zero or it but then he starts bulking up on me like okay I can't knock you out with an earthquake but maybe he's like shook a Barry I'm thinking he's just as EMU fighting Z and he's just bulking up and I'm my Ras fine I could put you in range for true Goodell sure I can out speed go for earthquake stuff like that doesn't do over half which is like okay that's fine I'm Mac special defense that's to be expected from a non invested attack mega steelix he keeps going frills bulk up something that's not gonna save you buddy I got that cricket out of the bag he turns out to be the pinch Barry is there or gets his HP back after three ball clubs I'm like okay he goes for another both up on me does it not look at sooo good this zero or is +4 attack and Plus forward defense kind of hoping that I can put it in range for an earth week which looking at it it should be enraged none of you reveals he is terrain punch and then I'm looking at my poke on I'm like this better being rain so an earthquake choice scarfed krookodile because if not and then I kind of just get swept by a bolt up there or which is not good this is where of getting stealth rocks up and keeping them up would have been at crucial I probably should have got them up versus what Anna versus wall read I think something like that not really no no I know no I brought him egg steal something zero where yeah I should have probably just brought it make seelix on the wall ring god of rocks and then went back into toca santera slash because this boy lived on a sliver of HP that see this will result effects what a battered very much because he would have died to the earthquake right there and that would have been amazing but unfortunately that is not the case and there or is it gonna sweep my entire team so yeah that sucks I lose his air or again with the same Jesus crazy roar calm down so that's of what I get for I guess running so guess I don't really know either way i forfeit right there because there's not much else I can do he just sweeps everything else with close combat and whole asthma fists so that is gonna be GD for his pain three losses today geez what happened I guess it's just a team I don't know I can't really blame myself you know I'm sitting I'm skinny but either way he definitely played very very well kudos to payin with the Sawtooth really interesting sets but at the same time can't be running these one at ko moves I mean I would have definitely appreciated magnets on this game that's for sure but at the same time he did get me the stealth rock play with his ought to give me I should just want her to jar balls out to you either way that is gonna be it hope you guys enjoyed make sure to leave a like comment subscribe deal thing and today was the Elle's for vis but don't worry we have a lot of dub use on this channel so might as well throw out some LS here and there because it's good to see me lose sometimes it's humbling to see me lose you get humbled and put in your place right there so yeah and plus it's enjoyable as well cuz you know people

Lyrics:
I’m the moon
Earths natural satellite
I rotate the same speed as the earth 
And I’m a natural source of light

I’m the Moon
My appearance is gray and white
You only see one half of my surface
Whether it's day or night

It’s believed I was created 
4.5 billion years ago
When A Mars-sized body collided with the earth
Their debris formed me real slow

Meteors, Asteroids, and comets 
Struck my surface for a billion years
Due to the fact that they don’t burn up
in my thin atmosphere 

If you wonder what a moon is
It’s a natural satellite 
One that orbits a single planet
the planet orbits a star so bright  

Scientific observations
were first made in 1610
by Galileo Galilei   
The Astronomer Italian

I’m the moon
Earths natural satellite
I rotate the same speed as the earth 
And I’m a natural source of light

I’m the Moon
My appearance is gray and white
You only see one half of my surface
Wheather it's day or night

When the Earth spins on its axis
Ocean levels stay the same
then the moons gravitational pull
Creates the tides that we see change

238,900 miles from the Earth
Is the distance measured
When the first spaceship
landed on my turf

The reason you see one half 
Of my surface all the time
Is because my rotations the same speed 
as the earth taught in this rhyme  

It takes 27 earth days 
for me to rotate once around
There is no air on my surface 
So you won't hear any sound


I’m the moon
Earths natural satellite
I rotate the same speed as the earth 
And I’m a natural source of light

I’m the Moon
My appearance is gray and white
You only see one half of my surface
Whether it's day or night",The Moon/Moon Songs For Kids/Moon Song for Children,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3YfLAAi3Vc,0,2563198,2923,572,1306,K3YfLAAi3Vc,"I’m the moon Earths natural satalite I rotate the same speed as the earth

moonlanding,,"Destroying the Flat Earth fairytale with the Moon from 43,000 ft.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvPRb_FuP_Y,-1,50658,2127,523,7367,BvPRb_FuP_Y,"so being a pilot has plenty of ups and downs but one advantage we have in corporate aviation is that the aircraft we fly generally cruise at higher altitudes then the airlines will ever use the bombardier global express can reach 51,000 feet but more typically we operate between 43 to 47 thousand feet because airliners don't get that high the airspace is relatively empty especially if you are crossing the Pacific Ocean at night as I did last night this provides us with more freedom to divert around bad weather or to make observations that confirm the earth cannot be flat as you will see in the following footage we were able to fly directly towards the moon and its position in the head-up display proves it was below high level as it was setting so what you're looking at here is a photograph taken through the head-up display while the moon was still quite high in the sky and I'll briefly explain the symbology as that will help you understand the following footage starting at the top this is the angle of Bank indicator with marks at 10 20 and 30 degrees to the right of that you see the words EVs on and that means the enhanced vision system is turned on and that allows us to see the horizon in front of us with the EVs off the background would be completely black and you'll see that in the following footage - below that we have the current autopilot operating modes you can see auto pilot 2 is engaged and it is in speed L nav and altitude mode speed means the auto throttles will be adjusting constantly to maintain this set speed of Mach 0.85 that is 85% of the speed of sound L Neff means lateral nerve and that means the autopilot is also maintaining the course across the ground and altitude means it is maintaining the preset attitude of 43,000 feet what we see next is this line running from right to left across the HUD that is called the horizon line and it represents the position of true level as you can see at this altitude of 43,000 feet the Earth's horizon is below true level now this double circle represents the flight path vector and the command being issued by the flight director the inner circle will show what the flight director is commanding and the outer circle with the two horizontal wings and the vertical lines represents what the aircraft is doing when the aircraft is maintaining a level flight when it is not changing altitude this flight path vector will be perfectly in line with the horizon line and what you'll notice when I'm turning the aircraft are numbers moving left and right along this horizon line those represent the direction in degrees magnetic as you can just see here the numbers two four represent two four zero degrees magnetic this small symbol that looks like a W is the pitch attitude of the aircraft and the difference between the pitch attitude of the aircraft and the flight path vector will give us an indication of the angle of attack on the wing if the aircraft was flying slower or if it was heavier with a greater fuel load we will have a bigger split between the attitude of the aircraft and the flight path vector and that is because we need angle of attack on the wing to generate the required lift so that's enough theory let's get to the good part because we are in the northern hemisphere as the moon was setting it was moving to the right and also because we are flying a great circle route later in the flight our heading is less than two for zero degrees so you'll see this two for zero to the right of the flight path vector and this is part of the video I will play shortly but as you can see the moon is now to the right of the head-up display so I had to actually turn the aircraft to the right to put the moon directly in the center here and what you'll notice is that the mode goes from L nerve to heading that was a manual selection that I made and it now allows me to control manually the heading of the aircraft this is the heading bug and as I change that you can see it's moving to the right the flight director is commanding a right turn and the flight path vector is following this command so that will all make sense now as you watch the video and because we are operating in oceanic controlled airspace we can't just turn left and right at will we have to ask for permission from air traffic control and I did that using the CP DLC system with this request request 15 miles right due to weather and that was sent at a 5:40 Zulu and just a minute later they came back with cleared to deviate up to 15 miles right so they gave us permission for the turns you're about to see and remember as you watch this video this line represents true level so if the moon is below true level it is not circling above a flat earth in fact if the moon is below true level that means it has not set and that means the horizon is also below true level so please enjoy so there you have confirmation once again that The Horizon did not rise to our level and the moon itself was below eye level as it was setting so it is clearly not moving in a circle above a flat earth now the last part I'm just going to show you how useful the head-up display with the EVs can be at night when you're going across the equator with thunderstorms all around here we can see that EVs is on and you can see the silhouette of these thunderstorms below us now if I turn the EVs off you see nothing all you have is darkness when you turn the EVs on you can see the thunderstorms and what I also did was tilt the weather radar down to see those same thunderstorms I had to tilt it down to minus nine point five degrees but you can see the radar painting the same thunderstorms we can see in the head-up display now operating without DVS you really have no idea of what's out there except for what the weather radar is showing you as you can see the EVs gives you very good situational awareness that's what thank lost"

Garth Brooks are you on stage with Garth Brooks I was and he was to get a sweatshirt on and you were behind a microphone and he was you know had his guitar slung around his shoulder and a what and you were kind of vague as to what I said did you sing what Garth Brooks yeah well I wasn't like yeah I was like yes my life has been made so what happened cause remember we talked on Friday or like I know if I'm gonna meet him or not I didn't I didn't know um you want the full rundown the full rundown cuz it's a hell of a story okay yeah I'm giving it to you okay so for for years and years I've known a relative of his but I've never asked a single question as soon as I found out that or or was told that he was a relative um this friend of mine I was like I can never say anything cuz I will I'll freak out like this the only guy I don't really have like heroes or musical heroes except for Garth Brooks right and and yeah you've said that in the past uh well I know when he was shouting at the band and stuff I guess the manager his manager is from here went to Normandy High School I don't know if that was the connection or no Garth's nephew who's an incredible dude and I met his family his family is the most genuine incredible people on earth so long to try to get it down to radio time he called me and said I've good news and bad news the good news is I think I have a ticket for you this is relative yeah is my buddy and he's like I think you can need to be down here um usually when he's in town or when we go to shows you know we hang out it we're on soundcheck timer because we're not gonna get a lot of time with him after the show so we'll hang out before me and you might have you might have an opportunity he's trying not to get my hopes up and I'm trying to get my because I don't need I didn't need this we were good just going to the show oh dude I just I'm that guy that I just want to be if I was in the same stadium as the guy I would have died having like this this is my dude he's the reason that I play music there was literally a moment sure and don't do the piano even if I start crying I may start crying and I'm like if you start crying the piano man I can't do it I'm not an emotional reactor I said about 12 tears a decade and I showed him all on Saturday and I'm trying I don't catch me so Garth Brooks day starts and he says come on down here you know around this time so so I did I was there like 40 minutes early to stand around will you by yourself or you by myself no eighty no I wasn't able to bring Malorie and because we weren't sure what was gonna happen and you you know even the family never really knows especially cuz this first day of the tour remember so I wasn't expecting much and he says hey Garth road managers can come on get cheese tall fella whatever so I was like okay so I see him and he's like come on in you know puts the pass on me to the speaking country what he's a tall drink of water he puts the sticky pass on me and it's got my name on it and we walk in and we're going through the halls and he's like have you ever seen Garth I was like no you know I haven't he's like well there's a there's this family you know you know my could go on over and I walk over and I see I see my buddy and I hug him I'm like dude you have no idea I can't believe this I know I'm on the floor right in front of the stage just looking at this even though drunk it that close that's freaking out these are the dudes that I've been listening to that changed my life in you know like 1990 and I'm talking to Mike and I'm and I'm just I'm thanking him and I and I meet his mom and and then I hear to my left Darth Brooks right there and he shakes my hand and I just went numb I went I didn't buy old fangirl wood what's the first thing you said to him I really don't know I don't know what I said I went I went numb it was like a spirit did you least have a firm handshake I know that I said that's the reason I've been able to provide for my kids the way that I have with my livelihood is because of him and it started with him uh-huh which brought tears to his eyes which brought tears to my eyes yeah no yet the piano guys is waiting so it brings tears to his eyes which brings tears to my eyes and then he says here put my number in your phone and and text me anytime you need anything or want to talk about something right here that cuts off so then I'm shaking and I'm I'm just freaking either borrow your phone real quick do you have your phone is just Garth just no I'm like my fingers don't worry I think I said that I was like my fingers don't worry I don't know what to do this doesn't make any sense none of this makes any sense and it didn't it was just like cloud 9 dream it was very surreal and didn't feel it didn't feel I mean I felt right but it didn't feel right cuz it just didn't feel real and nicest dude so so very genuine and gracious and and I mean that wholeheartedly like the dude is an example to me as not just a performer but as a as a man as a dad as everything I'm still pretty hung up about him his number in your phone under my friend Garth and I he said you know number and and I was like I was I was just flabbergasted that I'm standing nice to this guy yeah he didn't need to say a word I would have made my life plus some just just standing there knowing I was next to him so we're we're talking a little bit had a great conversation just just kind of about music he he knew I was a performer his family told me I told him about some of the stuff that I do and we kind of talked to that we were talking about not playing on a click and having that control of pushing and pulling sure and just our music yeah we just some talking shop performer talk just to musicians talking shop he just did that so we could write the lunch off you know so then so then he he's like yeah I gotta I gotta go we you know his first show of the tour so he he just goes around the the stage and he gets up there and first of all we talked about some of the songs that I've performed he said he ever done any solo shows you know I do different arrangements and and and then a few and I told him some of my favorite songs and he goes up and starts playing acoustic and just testing stuff out and he's got the Garth Mike on it him you know him and his hoodie and he's playing guitar and he's he's he was dressed bad and he starts doing some of the songs that I mentioned and he played I don't know I just went I instantly liked the family seen this a hundred times you know there's nobody in this in the stadium except for his family and me and I'd just I can't believe I'm here I don't know why what I did to deserve this I'm I'm I'm almost like panicked in this very weird stoic way and I go up to the front of stage cuz I gotta watch this like I'm so once in a lifetime opportunity I'm getting a private concert and I don't go to my phone was the full band on stage no interesting it was just him and he played is acoustic for I don't know 40 minutes maybe just just him testing things out played all a bunch of my favorite singer mentioned that he did not play that evening then Trisha Yearwood comes out and they they're testing stuff out and they're doing in another's eyes and and this song and that song and then she comes over and introduces herself to me and says hi to the family and he's still going and I'm just I'm just a kid studying every movement and just taking it I'm just taking soaking it in taking it in try not to cry yeah then the band comes up bang comes up and dude these guys this is this is his old band I've been listening to these guys he introduced the band they're all these guys have been with them 20 plus years and a couple of them I recognize like my face which is even shocked me is like oh my god I know they didn't and they start and they sound exquisite like I mean just flawless and then I hear the Thunder from from thunder rolls which was the moment in 1990 that like changed everything for me and I kind of briefly told him a story and he don't hit me don't hit yet no don't do it and he says my name says get up here and I'm and I'm not kidding my face went numb like it like my face went numb and I'm pretty sure I forgot all the words in the English language and I was like there's no way he's there's no way he's asked me to come up to this and that's not gonna happen he's talking somebody else and then he tells his crew members like make sure he gets up here alright and then I come up on stage and the whole time I'm like please please don't make me say guys you know me I'm not a nervous guy I'm very you have a good excuse to be nervous here I'm just saying I'm very controlled I've taken the stage for thousands upon thousands of people and if and I will say if that stadium were full I would have been less nervous but it's just me and Garth Brooks saying Garth Brooks and the band that like this is the the collection of human beings that set me on the path from where I am this this moment this song even and I'm going up and I'm shivering like I'm weird so I and there's a video of this and I'm gonna post it later the Thunder starts and as I'm approaching the mic I can't think of anything except for the first word was 3:30 you know like the first two words and he goes he looks at me the song has already started and he looks at me he goes I'll take the first first you take second I go no no I got the first two takes a second oh because all I thought was there's no way I'll remember the words by second verse is that in this is this a little clip no no that if you can't hear that because that was just him talking was well though clip of this oh really yeah he just goes okay take it and and and I took it and all I'm thinking immediately is I'm gonna fall front and flat on my face here because I realize that it's in a different key than I sing and my brain takes over and I'm like I don't have the range for this I'm not I'm not low so not only am I out of range but I'm like I'm shaking all I thought was please let's play this little clip here this is Garth Brooks and n moon sing adorn sound check listen escorting hear me it was remarkable then he takes he takes a third verse and kind of points to me like take it again and all I thought was halfway through when I finally started kind of getting my wits together a little bit I am realizing like what's happening and I saw I took the mic off the the stand and I realize like I'm here this is not gonna happen again this doesn't happen let's own the moment yeah and I got a higher range so like halfway through the chorus the second course I just I I went to my race you you as they say you opened it up I opened it go let er rip I can't do it lo with any sort of power Augusto so I I let it rip and it's not that it's not the prettiest of lines cuz I was again just my knees were jealous it's corrects him scream in the background you know what I bet he appreciated you doing that you went to your not I shouldn't say heat free Shay he now knows you can sing like a sumbitch because you went to where you can this little solo section thing he comes over and just starts talking he's like man you know we were talking about range I'm just joking he was kind of loosening me up and by this point you need to see in the video we're just staying in the center stage just just sort of like talking and he Thunder was going dude they had Stadium the video he's you know points to the mindless activities he just says finish it that is awesome I've now told more people about this and moon has all week and I'm calling everyone there because during the show towards the end guards you know kind of think in the crowd and then well then this little this little thing happens on stage Saturday night immediately right yeah that brought me to tears in my seat two men anything else I do want to thank him obviously but his entire family was something most like inspiring gracious people I do I do oh so much to him and his entire family and and Mike and and my lady for for allowing me to go down there and understanding what this what this meant to me and his I mean dudes I know it probably doesn't mean much to most people but if you've had any sort of moment where you've been inspired somebody they've really like changed the trajectory of your life and then you get to see them and tell them that that's more than enough for him to be as gracious as he was and then allow me to have that sort of moment for myself as a pretty crazy this is a life-changing experience experience for you yeah that the changes you will no longer be a d-bag just to let you know you know he brought a tear to your eyes but we just got any note said that audio brought a tear to my eye so I just want to let you know that you really brought a tear to goat balls his eyes that's our go balls res I'll just wrap it up by saying like this was like it was just like a story story book full circling listen even the bill just doesn't happen even what I think I told you that guy I think when I heard the news that Garth Brooks was coming to town and you want full-blown I mean you fangirled out months ago and then as we're we're getting up to the show and it's Garth Brooks day it's coming it's coming I don't think there was anybody in this city more excited yeah and then for this to happen I'm very I'm very very happy it happens to the right person that's amazing I'm glad you appreciated it I needed this right now this is very divine timing this came at the right time in my life all right yeah changed because you still got cowboy boots on somebody says here this is the perfect way to put it it's meeting your hero gone right yes it's yeah it was everything gone right I mean this is the song that that I watched you know when I turned in my dad was like I'm gonna do that and you got to sing that song Garth Brooks and like the literal sense I got to do that hey there's one day you may get there if you know the right people yeah so and thanks to everybody I posted a picture too and that was for me I'm just you know cuz I was so giddy and the support and and but I guess knowing how big of a deal he was to me was it was a big deal as well so that's great I'm honestly very happy for you Thank You Man thank you guys it was like that was it next off Jeff Burton yep can't wait what's your dreams oh when the Pope comes back and when I get up there and sing with him
moonlanding,"Scientists just noticed that this is happening to our Moon. We take a look at a recent discovery made by NASA on our Moon. 

Our moon has been around for billions of years. The Moon has been known since prehistoric times and it's the second brightest object in the sky after the Sun. Recently NASA's ARTEMIS mission show scientists some strange colouration on the surface of the Moon. It was then announced that this was due to a form of sunburn. It's well known that our moon has no global magnetic field. Magnetized rocks that can be found close to the surface do have small spots of magnetic fields.

Thank you for watching!

Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!",Scientists Just Noticed That This Is Happening To Our Moon,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whPWlwM47z8,1,34294,794,72,354,whPWlwM47z8,our Moon has been around for billions of years the moon has been known since prehistoric times and it's the second brightest object in the sky after the Sun recently NASA's Artemis mission showed scientists and strange coloration on the surface of the Moon it was then announced this was due to a former sunburn it's well known that our Moon has no global magnetic field magnetized rocks that can be found close to the surface do have small spots of magnetic valence some researchers refer to these as miniature sunscreens however the sun rays are deflected away from these areas and when they hit areas that don't have these sunscreens it causes a chemical reaction the end result is a darker surface the team have said they hope these findings will help to protect astronauts from harmful effects of radiation during future missions staying on the subject of the Moon a while back channel was making headlines were saying they're going to send an illumination satellite in orbit by 2020 they say it will be bright enough to replace street lamps essentially they want to send an artificial moon in orbit as you can imagine this has made many people question why they want to do this after all we do have something that lights up the night sky the moon scientists have also questioned why they'd want to do this so far not much information has been released about the project and this has left many wondering where the idea came from in the first place some have suggested the idea had been in testing for a few years and the technology was now in place to make it happen the China Daily newspaper stated that huge mirrors could be launched by 2022 it's not clear from any reports whether this project has any official backing the artificial moon would work as a mirror reflecting sunlight back to the earth so far we don't have any idea how this object will lurk but is thought it won't be small reports say the object will orbit 500 kilometers above the earth this device is said to be able to reflect starlight across an area between 10 kilometers and 80 kilometers what worried some people though is that it's been estimated the artificial moon will be 8 times as bright as the real moon this being said this could have an effect on wildlife and even some people seen some wildlife depend on the moonlight the reason behind doing this is to save money by cutting back electric bills this includes saving money on things like street lamps it's been estimated that by constructing this artificial moon it could say China to 132 million pounds a year so what do you guys make of this idea let me know your thoughts in the comments thanks for watching and don't forget to subscribe for more videos
moonlanding,"#FlatEarth #MoonInAtmosphere #geocorona 
1 small correction - I read my script wrong and said the moon was 285,000 miles up... nope its 238,000 miles up... Sometimes i rush thru reading the script that i mis-read information. This is one of those times. Sorry for the mistake, still doesnt change the argument.
For all of you who thought I went soft on flat earth!

#FlatEarthComedy #FlatEarthSatire #MoonsAtmosphere",The Moon Is In Earth's Atmosphere... So What? Flat Earth Fail,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cnh_uFkv1g,-1,22566,1209,526,2446,7cnh_uFkv1g,"hey guys and welcome to today's idiot video today we are going to be discussing a video posted by youtube user truth soldier titled moon and Earth's atmosphere nobody cares though now you gotta love when someone gives themself an ominous name like truth soldier who have no interest in finding the actual truth about anything except what they already believe in but people like true soldier are idiots so let's begin all right what's our Facebook friends and family I got something I got to get off my chest another idiot that hasn't learned to turn his phone sideways to make videos I guess I'll just add a background for him there you go that's better I'm a little mad right now because everybody's just shrugging off stuff right now it seems like to me ever since I could remember I'm 37 years old right now and ever since I can remember being a little boy is being told the Sun and the moon are in in space okay so doing pretty good so far the Sun and Moon are in what we call space why would this make you mad though shut the video off right now if you don't make no sense or you don't care I don't care okay but um I actually considered this option when watching your video but then I remembered your title and thought to myself nah an idiot with this level of stupidity is probably a good source of non intellectual entertainment so let's continue they just told us that the moon is in our atmosphere and dumbass idiots like you are freaking the out see Elvis taught an astronomy that the Earth's atmosphere ends at about a hundred kilometres and before we went any further my professor then said but this is not how higher atmosphere goes what we consider the edge of our atmosphere is known as the Karman line everything below the Karman line is considered Earth's atmosphere and everything above is considered space space however is not completely devoid of Earth's atmospheric particles which at this elevation is almost totally hydrogen last I heard the moon was two hundred and ninety four thousand miles away and that our atmosphere only extended about 124 miles up the atmosphere goes up 60 miles not 120 miles kilometers are not miles you idiot but to answer this briefly when someone says the atmosphere goes up a hundred kilometers they mean that is when we stop considering the Earth's atmospheric particles to be inside of the Earth's atmosphere and start considering them to be in the void of space that surrounds the earth that's a hundred thousand mile difference you want to check your math again there genius even if we use your incorrect numbers of the moon's distance of 294 thousand miles away in the Karman line being 124 miles up that's a difference of approximately two hundred and ninety three thousand nine hundred miles not one hundred thousand miles I mean I mean that's a lot of miles yeah and you're a  idiot okay all of a sudden they don't switched it up and I'm mad well thank goodness that science doesn't give a that they pissed off an uneducated Flat Earth idiot if you would have educated yourself on the topic you would have known that science has been aware of this since it was photographed from the moon in 1972 during Apollo 16 because I don't feel like it's a honest explanation I feel like they're backpedaling because there's a lot of truths coming out and there's things that they need to do and say just to make certain people feel better yeah people like you who think the earth is flat if only you could get past your cognitive dissonance you would realize that this news isn't saying that we previously thought that the moon was in space and now we think it's in the clouds this isn't a backpedal this is a public revelation of something that was previously known in the scientific community you should be thanking NASA for informing you of this instead of bitching about it because you don't get it it ain't making me feel better cuz I already knew that the moon was in our atmosphere okay aside from you trying to strawman this scenario let me explain what's going on with an easy example while giving your dog a bath if you spill a few drops of bath water on your shoes did you actually give your shoes a bath in the same sense as you gave your dog a bath no you you idiot the atmospheric particles outside of the atmosphere is known as the geo Corona that is what is splashing the surface of the moon and that is what is shown in this photo from 1972 atmosphere means sky so it's in our sky they're trying to say now do I really have to explain to a grown-ass idiot what the definition of sky is the sky is nothing more than everything you see above the horizon Sun Moon stars birds planes and Superman can all be seen in the sky but only a few of those are actually in our atmosphere true soldier is attaining a whole new level of stupidity with this video which the Bible already been saying that if you read it correctly most biblical scholars agree that any mention of a flat or non rotating earth is simply due to a lack of scientific knowledge at the time in any attempt to correlate the two is done with agenda based intent apparently true soldier thinks he knows more than the people who study the Bible as a profession but he's a Flat Earth idiot so who knows how inflated his ego is the sign and the moon he created two great light sources okay one the governor day and one the governor night that's the Sun in the moon that explanation might have worked 2,000 years ago but this is the 21st century and it's a demonstrable fact that the moon is about 285 thousand miles away spectroscopy of the moon's light proves that it's reflected sunlight and if it was its own light source then nothing would be able to cast shadows on it as we see during lunar eclipses and don't give me that magical body in the sky that we just can't see that for some reason never blocks out stars in the background but always blocks out the moon during eclipses truth soldier you are a idiot you put them in the firmament to put light on the earth and the Stars too bad you don't have any proof of this just saying it over and over it doesn't give your argument any validity until you can provide evidence that it is even true and I'm still waiting for that explanation on how the stars can be fixed in the firmament and still provide us with two rotational points in the sky flat earthers are  idiots and they want us to believe that they're Billy thousands and thousands of miles away where are you getting your information from the moon as you said is hundreds of thousands of miles away not thousands of miles away and even when you almost accidentally said billions of miles away even that would have been incorrect as a billion miles won't even get you to our outer planets inside of our solar system and the nearest star is about 25 trillion miles away maybe you should do a little bit of research before you start making claims that make you sound like a total idiot but they're switching it up they're trying to catch up they're catching up a little bit to what the Bible says but they were not ever all the way catch up because their job is to deceive us how exactly is modern science catching up to ancient science from 2,000 years ago please I'm sure everyone watching this video would like to know exactly what parts of science are converting their paradigms to Flat Earth there are none because modern science has long since passed up the ancient science from the biblical era and has no need to regress back to that point so no disrespect but if you were if you're a Christian you've been a Christian honestly I was wrong we are we have been wrong for believing in these people more than we're believing in the Word of God and what the Bible says as I said before outside of some fundamentalist sex and religion are Flat Earth idiots like truth soldier the religious consensus is that the earth is at least a globe now there is a much larger concentration of geocentric religious beliefs in the faith-based community but until someone finds some ether they're all just idiots - I don't give a damn about nobody that don't give a damn about me my family or God so you don't give a damn about anyone who disagrees with you nice and I wouldn't say that I don't give a damn about you and your family as I would never wish harm on another human being for holding a disagreeable belief however I don't give a damn about your religious beliefs as it doesn't pertain to anything in my reality I mean if you believe that you're spinning on a ball a thousand miles per hour 666 thousand miles chasing the Sun okay all these other planets is doing the same and in in the the god of gravity is supposed to just be keeping all that together that that sounds real scary to me thankfully science doesn't base its discoveries on whether or not it's going to scare the population of idiots around the world I mean could you imagine if science decided HIV didn't exist because it scared people grow the up and quit acting like it's your third time to third grade compared to what the Bible what I think the Bible says it says about the earth is immovable and it sits on pillars so if it ain't moving and everything else is moving around us I mean I feel a little safer the earth is not sitting on pillars the earth moves all the time there is no dome your safety is unimportant to reality and flat earthers are idiots and everybody want to talk about gravity gravity is only a theory look it up it's only a theory it has never been proven oh my goodness you are such a idiot you need to look at the difference between a theory and a scientific theory before making claims like gravity has never been proven because the scientific theory is an explanation of natural events that is well substantiated and verified through repeated observation and experimentation it is not the same definition as the theories a detective may hold as to why a crime was committed show me an experiment that shows water curving or bending or anything water always finds his level the surface of water will always be flat no matter what receptacle words in every photo of the entire planet of Earth shows water bending around the surface but I'm sure that wouldn't work for you and you would need an experiment here on earth to prove it to you how dumb are you really water bends around the surface due to gravity so asking for an experiment to show gravity wrapping water around a ball is asking for something that can't be done within Earth's gravitational field so this experiment would have to be conducted in space which I'm sure you believe doesn't exist to begin with so you would just say that I faked it all nothing will ever satisfy you because you've retained an unfalsifiable beliefs them and you're a nut job idiot but but you guys want to keep on believing these people who just switched up a story like that again this is just a new revelation to the public which primarily had to do with a better understanding of the size of Earth's geo Corona but we have been aware of its existence for decades now really the Bible never switched up no stories now that right there is a bold-faced lie perpetuated by a self delusional idiot the Bible has been altered since the day it was concocted keep in mind there is no such thing as a first edition Bible and until the printing press was invented the Bible was handwritten and most often from memory so discrepancies and inconsistencies existed from that circumstance alone not to mention the personal biases that led to changes or outright removals of stories from the Bible changes to the stories of Jesus's words on the cross and Luke the stoning of the woman in John and who Jesus revealed himself to after he was resurrected in Mark were all added after the Bible was first written these people have took sixty billion dollars of our taxpayer money truth soldier is so dumb NASA hasn't taken 60 billion of our tax money they've taken six hundred billion of our tax money but over a 60 year period of time now let me tell you just a few things you can thank your tax dollars for courtesy of NASA cell phone cameras scratch-resistant lenses LEDs you know those Nikes you like so much thanks NASA water purification systems the insulation you would have to have in your house if you lived in one wireless headsets freeze-dried bacon well it's really all freeze-dried food but bacon sounds so much better memory foam prosthetic limbs the portable computer and the computer mouse that you are using you disingenuous idiot same thing with the moon landing we Americans go USA USA we let it on the moon land oh nothing no one expects you to believe in the moon landings when you don't believe in space to begin with but I highly doubt you have any evidence to the contrary and your whole argument is based on your absolute ignorance of anything related to the sciences involved in other words you don't know what the you're talking about and you're a idiot okay these teachers these science teachers they finished start looking stupid do you really think it's the science teachers looking stupid here teachers for the most part are underpaid and underappreciated and are having to deal with more and more children whose education is being but the personal beliefs of their parents so it's not the science teachers that are looking stupid it's the flatterers idiots who choose to breed do not trust what these people are telling you obviously they don't know what they talking about yeah let's trust this  who's been completely wrong every time he's open his mouth someone who doesn't even understand the history of his own beliefs but openly encourages rebellion against the education system with a name like truth soldier you would think you were more interested in discovering the truth than perpetuating your own ignorances you are a idiot the moon was in space now it's inside of our atmosphere in our sky all right so now we can maybe get away from his emotional pleading and get back on topic so back to what I was saying earlier while the moon is being splashed by particles from our atmosphere which is mostly hydrogen the moon itself is not located inside of what we consider our atmosphere which is anything below the Karman line and that that's just nothing to everybody nobody cares I wouldn't say that nobody cares science nerds like myself find information like this fascinating but the truth of the matter is that the weight of this scientific revelation is minimal to the average human and will probably serve as a good bar trivia question one day as far as science goes this discovery may turn out to have a profound impact on future discoveries of life-sustaining planets as the geo Corona is mostly hydrogen which is produced by the large amounts of water on our surface so if we come across a planet that exhibits a similar geo Corona to that of the earth it would be a good place for us to start looking for a new planet to colonize but that just goes to show how docile everybody is how brainwashed everybody is indoctrinated and a lot of people are walking would I have to say the word cognitive dissonance I really hate when Flat Earth idiots accused the globe earth believers of cognitive dissonance when they are the cognitively dissonant people in this discussion really how can flat earthers hold a belief in the Flat Earth without a single shred of exclusive evidence to support it and not be cognitively dissonant at the same time I got people looking at me like I'm like I'm crazy like I'm an idiot I love when a flat earther gains himself yes your family and friends are going to express disappointment in you and your decision to reduce your intelligence to that of a nine year olds nobody made you be a flat earther that was all your dumbass decision so deal with the ridicule or stop being ridiculous really bro I'm not doing bad at all trust and believe guy got my back and that's the reason also like I'm doing good I can guarantee you that if you stop doing what you're doing and only worship God you will not be as successful what you have is a product of your work ethic and opportunity God has nothing to do with that God doesn't save sick people medicine and doctors do God didn't invent the computer and digital cameras and all these other nice convenient inventions you use the spew your all over the Internet humans much more intelligent than you did the same humans you accuse of being indoctrinated liars without the hard work of these people who have set aside their belief or non-belief into God none of what we know as technology today would even exist true soldier you and all your Flat Earth friends are idiots when the last time you seen something up on TV talking about God other than Joel Osteen or somebody like that who's making billions of dollars you know what I mean they got they own little they got the globe symbol in the background or that I believe you don't see religion blasted all over TV because the gig on organized religion is up corruption and sexual allegations at the top of the Catholic Church the actions of Christian fundamentalists like Westboro Baptist church members who protest at funerals of fallen soldiers in Islamic fundamentalists who still mutilate women too this day as a practice of their religion have all played a part in removing religious based programming from mainstream media there's nowhere in the Bible that says the earth is a globe never says it's a sphere is a circle circle and sphere are different the geometrical definition of a sphere is a perfectly round 3-dimensional circular shape in a circular shape is a shape that has the same properties as a circle true soldier you're gonna need more than Jesus Christ to save you from being an idiot what about sailboats and airplanes when they fly around or when they sell around the ocean around the world they call it circular he's and said the word when you circumnavigate circum we need to listen to these words we use is how dos our people are listen to the words that you say circumnavigation the circum part comes from the word circle circumnavigate can be used to describe going around a circle but it can also mean going around a sphere or around any object or if the earth was a tetrahedron and you could somehow still sail around it you would be circumnavigating a tetrahedron which isn't even a circle another delta idiot with a limited lexicon God created he drew a circle on the face of the earth face means the front of something man it's also flat the cognitive dissonance with this one is entertaining at least he claims the face of something means that it is flat while having a face full of curves in a sloping forehead idiot now I'm going to skip the next part of his video as he talks about the globe earth being responsible for people committing suicide which is ridiculous and he gets five dings for being dumb enough to reduce suicide to something as insignificant as the shape of the earth it really shows the lowered moral standards that true soldier personally holds is people believing that they live on a ball earth spinning a thousand miles an hour chasing after Sun after the Sun has sixty six thousand six hundred miles an hour 666 with no destination in sight that is saying that there's no God okay we're nothing we could die at any second and everything all the planning planet ass boom alien boom right you're done there's no hope might as well kill yourself but on the other theory which I believe in the geocentric theory or the Flat Earth on know people don't like to hear that word the earth ain't moving everything is revolving around us we are the center of everything so your sense of safety trumps everything including the truth whether it's physical safety or emotional safety or intellectual safety that's what's most important to you with your demonstrably incorrect view on the world you also have a false sense of safety especially intellectual safety you idiot we were put here for a purpose and there's a creator I'd rather go with that one well if that's the case then the Creator put you here for the sole purpose of amusing people like myself I needed a break from reality anyways turned on the internet and there you were thank you God for the idiot I'm about to receive now I'd like to take the time out to thank truth soldier a relatively new channel whose first video is the one I covered today has over 45,000 views in the first week congratulations it looks like being a con man is a natural talent of yours keep in mind every time you put out a video and say something stupid me or one of the other great debunkers of our time is going to call you out on your and point out how much of a idiot you really are so thanks guys for sticking around to the end and don't forget to smash the like button subscribe if you haven't already and ring the dinger to stay notified of new content i just

Video stars out with a couple of cool Infrared Captures (falling stars)
This.video is about the documented evidence I am gathering on the moon and both in our skies and in Space....showing us signs of a confirmed civilization off of our planet. No matter how many years it takes to have people know this truth it does not matter....as the information I have gathered will be there for you all when you are ready to accept the truth. We Are Not Alone. In this video LIVE ufo's firing on the surface and I show and explain exactly what you have to look for and how to look for Alien construction on the moon. Thanks...
http://myevent.com/bruceseesall",Proof Of UFO's EXPLOSIONS & Construction On The Moon's Surface,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgw5Vk2ICQM,1,11590,800,26,501,Pgw5Vk2ICQM,stop by to interact with the community and I every Friday night at eight o'clock for livestream Fridays hello good morning everyone falling stars how beautiful are they happy I was able to catch a couple for you we're not gonna linger very long on the infrared this morning because I want to get to the structuring and the surface objects on the surface of the moon I got lots more coming already saw in the comments that I got some trolls saying where are the building videos you guys try to keep me on my feet but in reality I've been doing this for two bloody years and the community knows it nice close-up of we could say that that is a falling star right that's when we see those of you who have seen some streaking across the sky and now check this out this one came by a little closer to earth I think then the moon when I say closer could still be a hundred thousand miles away right hundred thousand kilometers away but we do see that it's a nice streak of light in the sky and that's all I'm trying to do is capture keep my eyes in the sky capture anything of a big object now the celestial objects that I was able to show you guys here's a plane but I was able to show you guys a couple of years ago if I would have had the infrared we could have seen these objects really really clearly that was just some debris I liked light debris this is a big flash you just saw the app another big explosion here's a little sliver of an asteroid which is probably big enough if we're seeing it but yeah these could be close to Earth we're almost done the infrared guys you've been patient this week with the infrared I'm really liking the infrared I have a lot more footage that I'm gonna try to get but now there's a snowstorm again today so we're going back to the moon the moon at the moon is coming closer it's getting bigger and bigger every day a double flash this time so notice how it's different every time I do a session I'm always seeing new findings and that's what we're gonna do we're gonna document all the findings got a great video coming up guys some new techniques here's another plane to finish it off let's get over to the moon good evening welcome to the dark room I'm doing some of my editing and we're looking at clothes constructed objects guys on the surface of the Moon that's what we're gonna go see in this video the end Cheney crater first time I saw the surface there I did not see the structures and as I waited for the terminated a lawyer to come along I was able to get it two hundred thirty seven thousand square feet for under ten kilometers by two hundred and sixty five kilometers this is the Apple bite I call it scientists airtime agency the structuring here they really are layered objects over layered one on top of the other straight symmetric rope astronaut check this out guys and all these patches that you're looking at that are blurry those are smaller constructed objects until the school base not picking them up but notice their unique colors all the purple here you have all the green over here you have you know lime greens they're purples different types of green turquoises Aristarchus crater I was so busy this week the Samsung guy brought back my broken brand new television I had to be making room to set up to the summer in the back we're ready to roll guys some new techniques and new things come in and there's a lot that I want you guys to see we're gonna be looking at base like industrial like areas on the surface of the Moon they're white in color they're basically of the same reflectivity as the surface now look here I'm gonna show you guys exactly how it is up there and it's not more impressive than it is but it's exactly what it is and how I'm going to show you guys here it is so we're looking at symmetrical objects and some of the squares have a smoke haze or just other smaller structures around it to hide it these my friends are symmetrical objects on the surface I've showed them many a times I've showed them differently and now with the new telescope I'm showing them again and still people are always gonna tell me why are you showing the structure as well that's exactly what I'm doing this is in the Southern Highlands we're looking at objects this bridge like path would be about 30 to 40 kilometers long across it's really there 90 degree angles that we could see in this photo also there's a bunch of points that I'm going to show you that there are symmetrical objects down there that nobody is noticing right here there's a tunnel ization system connecting to this structuring 90 degree angles here with objects side-by-side lined along each edge of this angle here we do see that they're constructed layers on the surface just like in sinus Iridum which we'll go see again many times what do you think of this triangle I'm trying to show this in different ways so that you guys can get the eye to see what I'm trying to tell you yet look at the bottom underneath this photo on the right under the circle you see the tunnel leaving there these are all constructed objects it's not like earth some of you may say but we have to stop trying to look for mailboxes and Parks the moon is different but we're seeing that I'm not making this up I mean all I'm saying is that hey guys look do you find this attracts the eye of course it does it's it looks like a deliberately cut out area or I think it's more of a height a high level sky rising object 90 degree angles craters with straight edges and in the dead center of this photo you see all the structuring I see it clear as day know it I don't know what it is but yes I know it looks like it was possibly a manipulated surface that's what we can see look at sinus Iridum look at it look on the top left the tunnel ization that reaches every area everything elevated on massive shafts look very carefully how the surface of the Moon is built and constructed top right PN Cheney crater and all the structures and the bridge that I show you all in the city it's there the surface is there China was not able to land here because the surface was too uneven does this look an even to you I've captured so many UFOs that light up the surface I've captured some arriving to the moon that have lit up the surface many hundreds of miles wide like this one here that you see interacting watch and notice how the smoke haze and the light the intensity of the light on the surface and this is you know this is not Knut's I'm noticing the UFO each time that intensity of light of the UFO lights up the surface lathes up to we're seeing lights leaving this object look it's becoming a craft shape it's really what we are seeing on the surface and no one's noticing this this could be a UFO but then you have to wonder if it's not a projectile itself I always like noticing the surface and this is what I'm trying to show you guys here you're gonna appreciate it it's amazing watch this object come apart or explosions on the surface or objects coming out of it and this is right there y'all isn't that incredible this is the object you know these are UFOs this is what they're doing watch as the UFO descends to the surface watch how it changes the intensity of its light to changes shape and form well the whatever's around it is changing shape and form right the energy field will just say but watch how the watch what happens when it comes down to the service we're almost there coming down coming down this object you know there's something that just left the craft and now it's on the surface massive explosion that's pretty incredible I'm telling you whatever was a secret is out of the bag now do you see the triangular ish object I'm not trying to say this no it's not a perfect triangle okay but look at it how it looks built and it is it's a flat covering over this dark area so is this so the white areas have objects in the center of them but they're white the same reflectivity you can't see them but they're there so these are everywhere massive half symmetrical objects you could see there's forms there's shapes they're straight lines it's high off the surface they're not craters and these objects are really really they're on the service that's the whole secret covers or structures made to blend in with the surface we see two of them right here the one on the right the white one and the triangular one not two guys stick up to show you guys what I mean do you see the triangular shape I'm telling one thing if ever if ever NASA tells me they're going to in the southern highlands near Clavius crater we're gonna have a lot of fun because these objects are really there and they're just waiting for someone to find it we have to follow the terminator line and it's showing us revealing us all these structures with all the dark objects around them I just want to thank all of you for following the research and for taking the time to subscribe to this channel
moonlanding,Clear as day you can see in this video that the astronauts were being suspended by wires.,Astronauts on wires?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz9Bzi_GyD0,1,307141,1565,738,1481,Zz9Bzi_GyD0,astronauts moving in slow motion is another hallmark of the Apollo TV footage there is no evidence at all of any astronaut making a leap or a jump anywhere near a height commensurate with one and 6g possibilities if they were actually simulating EVs on earth they would then need help with the bulky heavy weight suits and backpacks in order to achieve the visual effect of moving around easily ending of gravity so enter wire supports this is a tried and tested way of relieving weight from performers or even flying an actor here is a sequence from one of our own productions excuse me will I need a car we're only making short-term to 1969 to the beginning of Dumas of course confirmation that wires were used is in the detail here in this Apollo 14 footage you can see a ping and the mentary glint and again run slow and once more there are other examples too this one is from Apollo 17 during the flag scene you can see the pain at the top of the frame in this footage from Apollo 16 we have telltale evidence for slightly floating dangling effect at the jump salute location it's as if the weight is being taken off the astronauts feet just a second or so too soon compare that sequence with an obvious rehearsal ring the dangling effect is very evident and here again from the same mission Apollo 16 we have an astronaut was about to get up let me give you a hand he says look at it again the astronaut is getting up with a wire taking the weight relieving him of 5/6 of the Earth's gravity a magic trick no just the help of a wire man this is a slow-motion jump would have been seen live on TV and here it is at normal speed the well-rehearsed pre-recorded material was apparently slowed down by 50% when we saw it on TV and yes we've done the necessary work to establish that percentage
moonlanding,A photographic expert exposes crucial problems with the photographs in the Apollo record.,Hoaxed moon photos - Dr. David Groves analysis,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYnIvrDlhb4,1,170319,1201,267,2010,wYnIvrDlhb4,dr. david groves is a physicist in the UK and a specialist in image processing I've been involved in image analysis for 25 years now I did my PhD developing holographic computer techniques for analyzing images my company Quantic image processing use these image processing techniques to extract three-dimensional information from two-dimensional images used in industry and used in medicine the mass of pictures that have analyzed contain many inconsistencies a whole core of which have no rational explanation or excuse david groves of quanta image processing using the technological resources at his command has traced this secondary light source and been able to calculate exactly where an additional light was placed in relation to the camera if you magnify the photograph and look at the boundary of the porch through which the astronaut is exiting you can see a fine shadow line around the porch perimeter this shadow line shows that you have a well localized source of light to the right of the camera most interestingly there is a hot spot on the heel protective their astronauts right hand boot this allows us to do some quantitative measurement we have access to one of these boots with a heel protector from which we could measure very accurately the curvature of that heel protector knowing again focal length of the camera lens the position of that hot spot on the heel protector and the orientation of the boot in the photograph we could determine the light path to that source of illumination the light source is between 24 and 36 centimeters to the right of the camera an ideal position for artificial lighting so it's now been established beyond argument that an artificial light source was used we even know where it was placed for the photography this important sequence of Aldrin descending the ladder at this point you might say well they can use extra lighting if they want to what's wrong with that according to NASA the astronauts didn't take any lighting to the moon and we can prove that there was no lighting the TV coverage of this event demonstrates this fact in the TV footage we can see Armstrong standing at the foot of the ladder as Aldrin descends supposedly taking the sill photos which are the official record of this event Aldrin is in darkness Aldrin is not lit yet the publish still photo sequence clearly indicates the use of an artificial light source tadam strong really take these still photos during all Doran's descent on the moon in our opinion probably not we propose that this is a completely restaged or rather pre-staged set of studio photographs so wherever the Aldrin descending the ladder sequence of stills was taken an artificial source of light was deployed I know that they had no extra lightning no flashes or things like that so it has to be the reflection from the surface that the astronaut will be adequately lit whilst in the shadow side of the LEM solely from natural light or earth shine bouncing off the lunar surface is an argument advanced by others as well as young Luneberg but it's untenable to make a direct comparison the surface of the moon on average has the ability to reflect light from any source water over at whatever distance from its surface to the same degree as Asheville does on earth on average approximately 7% in other words whatever the strength of the light arriving on the lunar surface whether by natural or other means the ability of the average lunar surface to reflect light remains constant indeed the lunar surface luminosity is so low it doesn't even manage to illuminate the shadow side of the smallest rocks as we've already seen here's another good example the Sun law prime light source is behind the LEM this picture is taken into the light so the side of the craft nearest to us should be absolutely black but has been filled in with a generous amount of light particularly obvious is this piece of equipment lumen ated from the front that sequence of images on the lunar surface take a blainley by Armstrong of course on that with that one camera which was incidentally left on the moon so it's gonna be a marvelous relic for when we eventually get back there of course the film came back that film probably I would say has never ever been bettered whether on the moon or subsequently almost every one of those relatively small number of images taken by Armstrong appeared to be splendidly composed you remember the classic face on picture of Orin with his visor reflecting the entire landing scene the lunar module the flag the TV camera and Armstrong taking the picture reflected in the visor it's a marvelous picture with that comment hjp Arnold has led us to another of the classic Apollo 11 images in fact one could say that this particular shot conveys the very essence of the entire Apollo program yet this classic picture of Aldrin has several very serious problems Aldrin cannot be standing in natural sunlight in this image because the surface around him is not evenly lit as will be the case with light from the Sun this scene is obviously lit with uneven artificial lighting the prime source of light is over Aldrin left shoulder the light is emanating from this direction we know this is so because we can see what photographers call fall-off in the top left the top right and the left four ground this fall off effect is the name given to darker areas caused by lighting a subject with a non-uniform source of light lighting that does not have enough spread as this false-color version particularly reveals secondly we can see that our old friend the fill in light has again been used to illuminate the suit detail on all Durin's right-hand side the left of the picture the camera position itself is also in doubt for we seem to be looking down on the astronaut how can we tell if that so well recalling the large center reticle cannot be anywhere but in the center of the image we're surprised to find that this reticle is the lower part of all drains right leg the Hasselblad camera was attached to the astronauts chest at the time and so the center of the image should be over the abdominal area of the subject this lower leg position for the center reticle strongly indicates that the camera was in fact positioned at a higher level as this graphic demonstrates the center of the picture can only be over the subjects lower leg if the camera is positioned at eye level and then tilted down the camera height and tilt angle was calculated by David groves this fact represents another serious problem the reflection of this scene mirrored in the astronauts visor shows the astrophotographer with his camera clearly positioned at chest level which actually cannot be so this false reflection must have been composited the painted in over the original image the reflection we see in the visor cannot be that of the photographer of the image the horizon is a very good datum on the moon the horizon effectively acts as a spirit level we know it's about 89 degrees from the true vertical therefore the position of the horizon cutting through the image of the astronaut shows us the level of the camera when the picture was taken and if we look at the picture we can see the horizon cuts very nicely at face level the camera taking the photograph could have been positioned on the chest of an astronaut and that astronaut could have been about two foot higher than the astronaut that was being photographed to this end we could analyze the shadow in the image basically the information we have in can make use of is we know the width of the visor in the image the focal length of the lens used on the camera using that information we can analyze the shadow of the astronauts left leg and determine between the two astronauts the variation in height of the surface the variation in height of the surface between the astronauts is typically a few inches it would have to actually be to feed to a explain the incorrect positioning of the camera when the image was taken I'll be honest with you I think that pseudo-scientific nitpicky claptrap and again I don't know why we should spend even a moment trying to judge that but as we've seen there are indeed crucial problems with the photographs that this is the point the so described nitpicky pseudo-scientific claptrap is not suitable all the analysis has been undertaken based on the laws of physics fortunately the information encrypted within these images has survived the voyage across three decades and is now being decoded by people like Percy and groves the proof is in the D

 hard opinions on JFK, I don't necessarily think Bush did 9/11, I don't believe that the government is putting chemicals in the sky, what are the other conspiracy theories? - Oh, I do kinda think that
 something happened at Area 51. I got into reading up a lot
 about conspiracy theories, and a lot of the times, it's all baloney. I go in specifically to debunk them. And I did so with the moon landing. So I started to read more
 stuff about the moon landing, after I started to debunk
 certain parts of it, there were some things
 that I couldn't explain. I don't think that we
 landed on the moon in 1969. Or, ever. Motives. Let's start with the motive of why the US Government would
 have faked the moon landing. Cold war is number one. We were at it with the Russians, JFK came out in 1961
 and said, you know what, by the end of the decade
 we're gonna go to the moon. And then therefore, we had to do it. Ask JFK, that's our guy. And we supposedly beat them. We didn't. There were concerns that
 Russia was gonna build a missile base on the moon. Sounds crazy, but it's not. And that's what people believe. As that decade progressed, we are not making the strides
 that we see Russia making, they put Yuri Gagarin out
 into space before we did, and that was scary. There's a lot of shit going on here. We have the Van Allen belt, lost cosmonauts, Gus Grissom, cross hairs, we'll get there, competing shadows. My theory is we didn't really
 have the technology to do so. Look at the computers that they were using in the Mission Control. They were like 16-bit computers, they were like TI-83 calculators. We're in this race, we are running up against an issue with the Van Allen belt. (dramatic music) The Van Allen belts are
 these radiation belts that kind of exist here. It's radiation and that
 would tear up the human body. NASA was having a really hard
 time trying to figure out how to safely send someone
 through the Van Allen belts. Russia knew that we
 didn't, but couldn't say, you guys don't know how to get people through the Van Allen belts, and we know because we don't either. (dramatic music) Russia quietly failing to send people through the Van Allen belts
 had killed a number of people. (dramatic music) Gus Grissom was one of
 the original astronauts on the Apollo mission. He was originally gonna be
 the first man on the moon. There's a conspiracy theory
 that NASA murdered Gus Grissom. He was publicly critical of NASA's success and ability to reach the moon. They needed him quiet. Right there, 1967, Gus Grissom died. They failed Apollo I mission,
 in which Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee
 died in a fire before launch. (dramatic music) There are a lot of discrepancies based on the footage of the moon landing. And a lot of those, I
 don't necessarily believe are good, hard arguments. What can't be explained away is the crosshairs on the photos. In the images of the NASA moon landing, these are photos that
 NASA took and released, there are moments where the crosshairs which are fixed to the camera
 actually lie behind equipment. The theory is, that the only
 way that the cross hairs would be behind a piece
 of equipment in a photo, would be if the piece of
 equipment was super-imposed. This happens on a couple of
 occasions in the NASA photos, and to me, I don't know
 how you get around it. (dramatic music) Say this is the photo of the moon, we got the rocks in the moon here, let's say the sun is over here, right, well we got shadows naturally this way, but in some occasions,
 there are shadows competing. This would suggest another
 light source over here, sending the shadow this way. If you're on the moon, there
 wouldn't be two light sources. There would only be the one, the sun. (dramatic music) The lack of artifacts. The easiest way to prove
 that we've been to the moon is to show people the things on the moon. However, everyone insists
 we don't have telescopes big enough to see the
 shit we put on the moon. The going argument is that to be visible from our best telescopes,
 something would have to be a little bit larger than a small house. That's nuts. (dramatic music) A lot of people suggest that the footage is just slowed down half-speed. We shot it in a Hollywood
 studio, jumped around, drove a lunar lander around sand, and then just cut it by half the speed. You take the actual footage
 from the moon landing, you do double speed, it
 looks almost exactly like a normal car driving around on a beach. Really very interesting. Look into it. (dramatic music) A lot of people have
 recreated the footage. It is very easy to do. BuzzFeed has done it. Did it almost exactly, and perfectly. I recognize that this looks like the ramblings of a crazy person. People look at me like I'm
 crazy, they're whispering, I hear it, they go, ooh, he's nuts. Do your own investigation. Come up with your own conclusion. And I think that you might
 find that that conclusion leads you to believe the
 moon landing did not happen. (dramatic music) - You're a moother? - Okay (laughs) - Are you a moother? Answer the question. - I didn't realize you were
 a moother, he's a moother."

everybody what I'd like to talk about for a few minutes today is the is the so-called moon hoax the the belief that we never actually landed on the moon it's a fascinating subject it's one that is silly and a whole lot of ways and one that doesn't deserve much attention but for some reason it gets a lot more attention than one might think there's a couple of reasons for that and one of those is we as a society love conspiracies is there anybody here who who thinks that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone at okay there's a few of us in that category but there's a whole lot of people that don't and if you watch movies like Oliver Stone's JFK you will get a sense that that that there was a huge massive conspiracy of apparently everybody else in the country but be that as it may we love this sort of thing and and we've always loved it as a society conspiracies go back to the very birth of the American Republic it has it has dominated a lot of thought processes it has also led to some very serious results I mean quite frankly the British colonists in North America were responding to a belief that a conspiracy was underway to rob them of their rights as Englishmen and they undertook the American Revolution as a result of that so it did motivate a lot of people in that particular setting that usually doesn't go that far but but nonetheless we'd love to think that there's this powerful malevolent and a conspiratorial group of people that are out there controlling things and we somehow don't have any sense of our own destiny a fascinating dynamic from a psychological perspective there's been lots of work that's been done on that well the moon hoax is one example of this particular problem in American history it doesn't take very long to find evidence of people talking about this even at the time of the first moon landing in the summer of 1969 and we're going to be celebrating the 40th anniversary of that event in just two or three weeks now about three weeks from now you know you can't necessarily believe that Bill Clinton in his autobiography after he left the presidents he said that he was working as a helper to a carpenter in the summer of 1969 and that carpenter said basically the same thing I you know those guys in Hollywood they can fake anything look at all the stuff that they've done previously they did this as well now those kinds of of disbelief is really built upon naivete and and not really necessarily thinking about it too long and hard in those particular cases but there are others who who emerged fairly quickly thereafter to to question it pretty thoroughly and and sometimes they're doing it for economic gain sometimes they're doing it for fame sometimes they're you honestly believe what they say not all the time I might add but they also then proceeded to try to convince others of this particular idea and lots of news reports about this at the time that that suggested that they weren't able to believe I mean there was one particular news story that said they talked to a woman who lived in Atlanta and she said well I know that these guys didn't go to the moon because my television set can't get the television stations from New York how on earth can they get earth literally how on earth can they get broadcast from the moon and so that's that is again another statement of naivete about the technology the first serious questioning of the moon landing came from the fellow by the name of bill casing in 1974 who wrote a book actually was more of a pamphlet that said we ever really actually went to the moon and there's all of these reasons why and he's really got kind of three basic arguments they've not really been modified much since that time they've maybe been elaborated on a little bit but basically it's it's three types of evidence that people talk about the first is what they think of as anomalies in the still photography that was taken on the lunar surface that's the first thing the second thing is the the sense that radiation especially radiation in the Van Allen radiation belts would kill any human being that went into those and consequently they couldn't have gone for that reason and and the third reason was is that just in in the overall scheme of things technology does not exist sufficient to allow us to go anywhere else in the solar system and and and he had a few pieces of evidence he he had a lot of questions that he raised but but that was essentially the sum total of his argument it wasn't very sophisticated or very lengthy it's been as I said modified added to adapted slightly since that time and and most people don't believe it quite frankly if you take any poll at anytime where a question along the lines of do you let's take this poll right now how many of you think we landed on the moon okay and anybody want to raise their hand saying no I don't think we did okay okay all right Peter Jacob back there always a disbeliever anyway and and and what and what you get typically when you ask the question about about the polls are it's something in the neighborhood of six percent or so who say yeah I questioned this now that's a pretty small percentage and remember the margin of error for most of these polls is three to five percent so it's conceivable that is a very minuscule amount the the other point that's been made by a number of people who do polling for a living is that you know you can basically get six percent of the public to say anything and and so for that reason you know you can't necessarily believe it but there are some interesting developments that have been taking place over the last few years especially in the in the era since the Internet has come on online in the 1990s up to the present there has been a proliferation of information about these so-called moon hoax I myself have been branded one of the conspirators since I yeah I'm very proud of that by the way and since I do accept the fact that the astronauts did indeed walk on the moon and that we did it six times and that we had one failure unfortunately we brought the crew of Apollo 13 home alive just barely everybody saw the movie I assume and but be that as it may we want to question this kind of stuff and with the ability to communicate in ways that hadn't existed previously you can communicate very easily and the barrier for entry into publication on the internet is so low I mean essentially it's anybody with a laptop that you know and then a some sort of phone line can do this you find that there's been this broad proliferation of these of these particular arguments some of the the websites and by the way if you do a search you're going to find over a thousand websites that discuss the moon hoax most of the time they do bunk it but a not insignificant number of the time they are conspiracy websites and and that's pretty easy to go find those and feel free if you want to to engage in that particular activity the and and so that barrier for entry for publication has been very low and the ability to communicate across these various groups with this specialty audience has become much much greater all of this probably doesn't mean anything until it got raised to an entirely new level when Fox in 2001 some of you may remember this particular so-called documentary with it with the title did we land or did we go and it it it really lays out the conspiracy theories that exist existed at that time and then a few that have been kind of developed since more fully and it was it was it was not one of those we report you decide things by any stretch of the imagination it was the conspiracy theorists with an hour of of main network television primetime to make their case and they they succeeded in convincing I shouldn't say convincing at least raising doubt in a whole lot of people's minds that would never have thought of at the time I was at NASA at that point I was chief historian and immediately when the Fox special aired I hesitate to call it a news special when it aired we started getting inquiries from mostly parents and from teachers who said I need something that will enable me to talk to my kids who saw this silly thing and I don't know how to answer it so they so at NASA we developed a fact sheet and a variety of other things up until this time NASA's official response was we will not dignify this nonsense with it with any kind of rebuttal and that might have been fine for you know in the pre-internet era when it was a relatively small thing in the communication capabilities were not what they were later but when Fox certainly makes it available to to millions of people then there then there Rises this issue and so we started to develop a set of fact sheets a set of standard responses that we started to use in this context and we weren't alone there we were we had a lot of folks who are outside of NASA at the time who did the same sort of thing saying we can't allow this to go unanswered and as a result of that there's been a lot of counter argument that's been made in the last few years some of this is is silly and some of it is not the part that is is silly is when you've got things like Bart's eyebrow in I think it was August of 2002 and Bart's eyebrow is a conspiracy theorist he likes to make documentaries or at least he calls them documentaries and and then he wants to confront the astronauts who walked on the moon he has been known to shove a Bible in there in front of them and say swear on the Bible that you walked on the moon some have done it he confronted Buzz Aldrin and a hotel in in Los Angeles one day and some of you are laughing already because you know what I'm going to talk about and and any pull his standard sort of stunts and and when Buzz kind of just ignored him he said he starts talking and you can see it by the way the video it's on it's on YouTube he he starts saying you are a liar a cheat and a no-account and at that point Buzz gave him a left hook that sent him reeling and he immediately turns around to his cameraman and says did you get that on tape anyway that's the silly part the serious part is that when we think about history we have to ask ourselves the question how do we know what we know the fancy term for that and some of you know that is epistemology and how do you think that you know something happens someplace is it if we witness it by our eyes does that mean that we know this if we didn't witness it do we accept the accounts of eyewitnesses do we accept the accounts that we see through the visual record either still still motion still imagery or motion pictures or something like that over television or the internet or whatever how do you decide what is real and what is not that is a fundamental question and it's a fundamental question throughout history and certainly up to this present time and as we recede farther and farther from the experiences of Apollo and I see some in the audience who who were alive when Apollo took place now I was a kid I was listening to the broadcast of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the moon in July of 1969 but I got to tell you I was sitting on the hood of a car with the car radio on and there was a girl sitting beside me and what was taking place on the moon was not my primary focus but I did hear it that's that's not true for those of you who didn't experience it half of the world's population has been born since we stopped going to the moon in the truest sense of the term it is history for them and it is in that community who have not experienced it in any way shape or form where you get the largest amount of questioning there were polls that were done in the mid part of this decade about 2004 or 2005 is the last time I've seen this poll in which the question was asked do you believe we landed on the moon or do you question whether or not we landed on the moon that there's a way that way the question read and the majority of the people and when you aggregate everything about six percent say I questioned it but when you divided up by age group into the 18 to 24 year olds who were surveyed in that particular poll 27% questioned it that is statistically significant and and that raises interesting questions in my mind as to what that means and and how we deal with it I think it has something to do with the fact that they didn't witness it at all it is history I think it has something to do with with the demise of trust in government and institutions in general my kids who are in that category are actually a little older than that now I will tell you with a surety that they will never see Social Security or any of those other sorts of things they do not believe they will be there for them and and that is a statement of distrust of a social contract that's been in place now for a long time nearly a century with that kind of distrust I would suggest to you that it's easier for them to question these sorts of things the reality is I think and just to bring this to a close it would be the coolest thing in the world to go back to the moon just to prove we went there the first time and with that I will in my comments if you all have questions or our Barb's feel free thank you for listening to this edition of ask an expert a companion question-and-answer session for this lecture may also be available for a schedule of upcoming ask-an-expert lectures at the museum please visit
moonlanding,There's a conspiracy theory that astronauts never landed on the Moon. Is it all a conspiracy? Were the Moon landings faked? What is the evidence that we actually went to the Moon?,How Do We Know the Moon Landing Isn't Fake?,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHt842u_Yw4,-1,325833,3565,1226,3615,DHt842u_Yw4,"Apparently, there's an organization called
 ""NASA"", who's done a remarkable job of sticking to their story. They say Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed
 on the Moon on July 20, 1969, and set foot on the surface 6 hours later. This same organization claims there were 5
 additional missions which successfully landed on the Moon, and an alleged total of 12 people
 went for a walk there. Can you imagine? According to them, they spent $24 billion,
 which is more than $150 billion in inflation adjusted dollars. Their so-called ""Apollo"" program allegedly
 employed 400,000 people, supported by more than 20,000 companies and research institutions. I say ""alleged"", as some people choose to
 think the Moon landings were acts of cinematic chicanery. More than 10 years ago, Fox popularized the
 Moon landing conspiracy with a show called ""Did We Land On The Moon?"". They revealed several pieces of evidence about
 the hoax and cover-up citing incorrect shadows on the Moon, lack of background stars, and
 more. Each of the pieces of evidence they present
 is wrong and easily explained once you understand the underlying science. ... Or at least, that's what they would have
 us believe. Phil Plait successfully brings a NASA supporting
 voice to this story, explaining how the evidence against moon landings is at best, fantasy
 and misunderstanding. A more cynical view might be to suggest it's
 a deliberate manipulation created to maintain an anti-scientific narrative to foster ignorance,
 mistrust and uphold a larger political agenda. Do a little search for ""Phil Plait moon landing""
 and you'll see him present even handed science over any one of the arguments. In fact, if you buy into that whole ""evidence""
 idea, he appears to successfully tear apart the conspiracy arguments. Some still, are not convinced, possibly including
 you. NASA and Phil, they're in cahoots. Phil's a PhD astronomer, which means he studies
 space, one of the letters in NASA stands for SPACE, I think it's the A. Coincidence? I think not. There's collusion going on there. The main pillar of any conspiracy requires
 a few select people keeping a really, really, really big secret. Looking at the numbers. The select group required to successfully
 fabricate the appearance of hurling metal capsules containing humans at our orbiting
 neighbor and then retrieving them, additionally keep their story straight for at best 45 years,
 and never, ever slip up... is about 400,000 humans. So, there are really two sides to this story,
 the NASA side which is... They went to the Moon. and everyone is telling
 the truth. OR, they never went to the Moon, and somehow
 400,000 people have never, ever, ever, ever let it slip that they made a bunch of fake
 moon rocks, or the rockets shot up didn't really go anywhere. It's all a big ruse. The thought 400,000 people have managed to
 keep their mouths shut is definitely the more romantic perspective. Seeing people come together to screw with
 everyone, and then never blabbing. This truly is a triumph of the human spirit. When something big does happen, like the Chelyabinsk
 meteor, we see the evidence everywhere - for example captured on Russian dashboard cameras. For the lunar landing, NASA suggests something
 similar. There are independent astronomers who tracked
 the rockets escape from Earth's gravity, and are either providing unsolicited, nonpartisan
 unfunded support of the events, or they're in on the whole thing. The Russians, who were in a race with the
 Americans to be the first to set foot on the Moon, allegedly tracked the missions in horror
 and disappointment. NASA just keeps sticking to this story that
 they sent people to the moon. In fact, they just keep on producing more
 of their ""evidence"". They recently published high resolution images
 of the surface of the Moon captured by their own Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Adding a whole new generation of secret keepers,
 who now know the secret handshake and get participate in the rigging of Oscar nights. They imaged all of the alleged Apollo landing
 sites, and they haven't missed any detail. You can see the landers, rovers, and even
 the astronauts' footsteps. The images show that all the flags planted
 are still standing, except Apollo 11, which was blown over by the exhaust from the ascent
 engine. Or alleged exhaust from an alleged ascent
 engine, if you're still thinking 400,000 people are continuing to punk the triumphs of mankind. Some might suggest that a big cheque was sent
 on over to China and Japan, to have them verify the landing sites by photographing them with
 their own spacecraft. According to NASA the astronauts placed retroreflectors
 during their missions which reflect light directly back to Earth. Apparently these can be used this to calculate
 the distance to the Moon with 1 cm accuracy. So, if you want to confirm that humans went
 to the Moon for yourself, you could just point a high power laser at the landing sites. Sure, there are many large independent institutions
 which have verified the existence of these retroreflectors, but who knows, maybe they're
 some how pawns of our silent and vigilant 400,000 co-consipirators. What do you think? Make up a conspiracy theory for your favorite
